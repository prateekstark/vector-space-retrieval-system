 Foreign Minister <PERSON> Sousuke </PERSON> <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> has emerged as the most likely candidate to succeed scandal-tainted Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>, who will resign soon, news reports said Saturday. Party leaders said <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> emerged as the top contender after talks Friday between <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> and <PERSON> Masayoshi </PERSON> <PERSON> Ito </PERSON>, chairman of the party's policy-making Executive Council, according to reports in the mass-circulation <ORGANIZATION> Asahi </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Yomiuri </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Mainichi </ORGANIZATION> newspapers <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> was scheduled to meet with party Secretary-General <PERSON> Shintaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Abe </PERSON> Saturday afternoon to discuss the selection of Uno, the reports said. Uno, 66, a 10-term member of the powerful lower house, has served as foreign minister under <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> since 1987. He has held the international trade and industry portfolio and served as party deputy secretary-general. An official at Uno's office said the reports about his being top contender were rumors and refused further comment. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s office was closed Saturday Party leaders reportedly favor <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> because he is untainted by the Recruit scandal, which already has led to more than a dozen arrests, and has experience in foreign affairs. Opposition to Uno remains, however, as he is a leading member of the party faction headed by <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s predecessor, <PERSON> Yasuhiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON>, who earlier this week was forced to testify about his links to the scandal before parliament. <PERSON> Ito </PERSON>'s refusal May 13 to take the top job created a leadership vacuum in a governing party desperately in need of a leader with a clean enough reputation to steer the party out of scandal. The <ORGANIZATION> Recruit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a publishing conglomerate at the center of the scandal, is accused of trying to influence government policy by selling underpriced, unlisted shares in a real estate subsidiary and by doling out millions of dollars of political donations. Along with <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s resignation, the scandal has led to the downfall of three <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> ministers and the arrest of a former chief <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> secretary. Many governing party members have called it the worst crisis since the party was founded 34 years ago. In the meeting with <PERSON> Ito </PERSON> on Friday, <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> agreed to stay on as prime minister until a successor is found, though on April 25 he vowed to leave office soon after the year's budget clears parliament. The budget package is due to become law on Sunday. The head of the governing party routinely serves as prime minister because of the party's large majority in both houses of parliament. But due to the current crisis, the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> are reportedly considering installing separate individuals in the two posts _ thus placating party elders who fear they may lose power if a young prime minister is named. The reports said a possible combination is former Prime Minister <PERSON> Takeo </PERSON> <PERSON> Fukuda </PERSON>, 84, who would assume the party presidency, and Uno as premier. <PERSON> Fukuda </PERSON>, now in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, said Friday said a younger man should be chosen for prime minister. He is to return to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> Sunday. <PERSON> Ito </PERSON> also cited his age and poor health as reasons for declining the job. Other names that have come up in the leadership race are lower house speaker <PERSON> Michita </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakaka </PERSON>, 72, former Deputy Prime Minister <PERSON> Shin </PERSON> <PERSON> Kanemaru </PERSON>, 74, and <PERSON> Masaharu </PERSON> <PERSON> Gotoda </PERSON>, 74, who heads the party <ORGANIZATION> Political </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reform </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>.

 Hardliners moved to tighten their control of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> on Friday after moderate <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON> was stripped of his power and placed under house arrest. Students leading the demonstrations that have forced the power struggle continued to occupy <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s Tiananmen Square one week after martial law was declared in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. But thousands could be seen leaving, and crowds dwindled to about 15,000. Despite the drop and the apparent ouster of <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON>, who had been more conciliatory toward the protesters, students vowed to continue to press for social reforms and the resignation of hard-line Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON>. The protesters previously have demonstrated the ability to rally huge numbers of citizens on short notice. Communist Party members nationwide were studying two sets of documents as the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> prepared to meet. One document blamed <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> for the 6-week-old student movement and the other called for a `` resolute suppression of the disturbances,'' sources said. <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> had expressed sympathy for the student movement, was the first to call it `` patriotic'' and apparently worked behind the scenes to oppose the May 20 declaration of martial law in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. But sources said conservatives accused <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> of splitting the party, instigating disturbances, revealing party secrets, corruption and taking credit for achievements of senior leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON> during the past decade. On state-run news Wednesday night, <PERSON> Li </PERSON> was quoted as saying that <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> `` is the main reformer in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, not anyone else.'' Although <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> ushered in market-oriented economic reforms, student protesters have been pressing for political freedoms, such as a free press, and an end to official profiteering. Millions have taken to the streets in recent weeks to call for the resignation of <PERSON> Li </PERSON> and <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>, who are more resistant to social reforms than is <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON>. <PERSON> Li </PERSON> was quoted Friday in the state-run press as calling on soldiers surrounding <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> to conduct `` a resolute struggle against the plots of a small minority.'' Eastern European and <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> sources said <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> was stripped of power Wednesday night during a meeting of top government officials and was under house arrest. The party's <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> would have to ratify any leadership change. It is expected to meet soon. Sources said officials who have worked under <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> on political and economic reforms also were facing punishment. They include the party's propaganda chief, <PERSON> Hu </PERSON> <PERSON> Qili </PERSON>; Vice Premier <PERSON> Tian </PERSON> <PERSON> Jiyun </PERSON>; and <PERSON> Bao </PERSON> <PERSON> Tong </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> aide. They said the main winner in the struggle appeared to be <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>, 84, who apparently was behind <PERSON> Li </PERSON>'s imposition of martial law and is believed to still have final say on major decisions. Students by the thousands were leaving <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>, the focus of two weeks of continuous demonstrations. By nightfall Friday, about 15,000 students remained on the vast expanse that once was occupied by more than 100,000. Students insist the drop in numbers does not mean their movement lost momentum or was cowed. A few students admitted they feared violence now that the conservatives seem to be in control, but most said they were tired of sleeping on concrete in unsanitary conditions. Student leaders said they were urging non-Beijing students to go home because they can do more in spreading the movement there than by staying on the square. The leaders expressed confidence they could again quickly mobilize large groups of students and residents if the confrontation with authorities escalated. The main train station was packed with students returning home. The television news quoted a station official as estimating 20,000 were leaving Friday. But some said they would not leave. `` Everybody in the country is watching the square,'' said one student leader. `` If we leave, we will betray their hopes.'' On Friday, more government leaders embraced <PERSON> Li </PERSON>'s hard-line stance. <PERSON> Chen </PERSON> <PERSON> Yun </PERSON>, the 84-year-old head of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, a powerful advisory group, appeared on TV to support martial law and the commission later followed suit. A government source said <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiannian </PERSON>, 81, who formerly held the ceremonial post of president, spoke at the meeting where the decision was made to strip <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> of power. He criticized <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> for fomenting the student movement and equating it with `` a struggle between two army headquarters.'' Such a description indicated conservatives view the general secretary's alleged crimes as serious That speech and one given by <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s 81-year-old President <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> <PERSON> Shangkun </PERSON> made up one of the documents being studied by top party members and officers, said a government source. <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> said <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON>'s actions `` had a very bad effect'' on the nation, the source said, and indicated that party members, intellectuals and journalists who participated in the movement would be punished.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> arrived Friday enroute to a summit with <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> leaders, hoping to use personal diplomacy to resolve a long-simmering dispute over European-based nuclear weapons. In brief arrival remarks, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> made no reference to reports that he would use the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> summit next week in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> _ his first as president _ to announce a reduction in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Instead, he declared the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> wants a `` stronger and more united <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>,'' and said he plans to be `` actively engaged in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, promoting measures to encourage political and economic liberalization in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> plans to visit <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> in July. The dispute over short-range nuclear weapons has defied resolution by the two main countries at odds _ <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, pressing for negotiations with the Soviets to rid <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> of such weapons, and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, supported by <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, wanting to keep the weapons there and make them better. Other members of the 16-nation <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> alliance have lined up on one side or the other, with a few stradding the fence. Officials on all sides have sought to dismiss suggestions that the issue would seriously disrupt the summit, which was designed to celebrate 40 years of Cold War unity against the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. As <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> left <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, The <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Times reported that he planned to use the summit as the stage for announcing a reduction of up to 10 percent in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troop strength in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, `` as many as 34,000 troops.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> quoted sources in Saturday's editions as saying the administration is considering an offer to negotiate cuts in troop strength, aircraft and helicopters in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> if the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> agrees to cuts in tanks, armored personnel carriers and artillery pieces. Numerous administration officials, with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and back in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said any word on that would have to come from the president himself. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> told reporters aboard Air Force One en route to <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>: `` Any ideas in this area would be one the president would want to discuss with the allies, he would raise with his partners at this session before he discusses anything publicly. ... I am not confirming or denying any decisions.'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> did not dispute the newspaper's account. He said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` will be discussing a lot of different ideas with the allies'' but that he `` just ca n't speculate on what the conversations might amount to or what the president might suggest.'' The White House spokesman also stressed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would make no move on troop deployments in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> without having consultations with <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> first. Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, D-Ga., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, told <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> that 10 percent `` is the probable amount of reduction that would occur if the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> accepted the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> proposal on conventional arms control which is now tabled. In <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>, West German spokesman <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmuelling </PERSON> said, `` We have no official word of such a decision.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, in comments just before leaving on his first trip to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> as president, expressed hopes to see a <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> `` that is truly free, united and at peace.'' He repeated his desire to move beyond any Cold War policy of containment `` to integrate the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> into the community of nations.'' `` We welcome the political and economic liberalization that has taken place so far in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and in some countries of <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. We watch hoping that more changes will follow.'' As for the Western military alliance, he said, `` <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> has been a success by any measure but success breeds its own challenges. Today, dramatic changes are taking place in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, East and West. For us, those changes bring new challenges and unparalleled opportunities.'' In remarks prepared for his arrival in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>, he praised U.S.-Italy ties of friendship and said, `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> welcomes a stronger and more united <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.'' Several weeks of busy diplomacy, including a high-level meeting in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> and two others in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, failed to settle the missiles issue, a subject that Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> called `` extraordinarily important.'' The issue is whether the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> should negotiate to reduce and possibly eliminate all the short-range nuclear missiles <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact have deployed on European soil or delay indefinitely while the two military alliances negotiate over reductions in troops, tanks, artillery and other conventional armories. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> insist that <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s missiles, which they want to make more powerful, are vital to the defense of the alliance. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and its supporters contend a series of moves by Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to reduce nuclear and non-nuclear weapons reduce the missiles' significance The dispute has symbolic as well as strategic facets. It reflects, on the one hand, a a determination by the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration to stick to its position, and on the other the emergence of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> from post-World War II acquiescence to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> affairs. `` It should not be resolved at all costs,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said while predicting the missile issue would not dominate the summit next Monday and Tuesday in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>. Until the dispute boiled over, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and the White House staff were planning on a calm presidential visit to friendly countries where he could step serenely through a series of picture-taking events. He will visit <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> as well as <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>. That schedule remains intact, though the missile dispute probably will require some clever draftmanship to paper over the differences in a windup <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> communique that stresses Western solidarity. In <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, besides talking with Italian government leaders, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will meet with Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> on Saturday in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> and attend Roman Catholic mass and a Memorial Day ceremony in an American cemetery in <LOCATION> Nettuno </LOCATION>, on the seacost 39 miles south of the capital, on Sunday. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is an Episcopalian. After te two-day <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> meeting in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>, the president will continue his discussions with West German Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> on Wednesday over dinner in a ballroom where <PERSON> Mozart </PERSON>'s `` Magic Flute'' opera premiered in 1793 and on a riverboat cruise on the <LOCATION> Rhine </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> on Thursday <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will have the comfort of winding up his travels meeting with his strongest supporter in the alliance, Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, at 10 Downing Street, and lunch with Queen <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> at <LOCATION> Buckingham </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palace </LOCATION>. Then, on Friday, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> flies to <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> for a weekend off.

 Making the racy tabloids pay large sums for libel to pals of royalty and other notables is one thing, but an award of nearly $ 1 million to the <ORGANIZATION> Yorkshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ripper </ORGANIZATION>'s wife is provoking comment that things have gone too far. `` Whose justice is this?'' the Daily Mirror asked on Thursday. `` Preposterous,'' declared the <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION>. The 600,000-pound -LRB- $ 942,000 -RRB- award Wednesday to <PERSON> Sonia </PERSON> <PERSON> Sutcliffe </PERSON> was the largest ever made by a <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> jury. Her husband, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON>, is known as the <LOCATION> Yorkshire </LOCATION> Ripper for terrorizing northern <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> in 1975-80 with the murders of 13 women. It was levied against <ORGANIZATION> Private </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eye </ORGANIZATION>, a satirical magazine that has thrived on the notoriety of frequent libel cases. The 200,000-circulation magazine, which is partly owned by actor-comedian <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Cook </PERSON>, has begun a fund-raising campaign to avoid bankruptcy. Private Eye said in 1981 and 1983 that Mrs. <PERSON> Sutcliffe </PERSON> had sold her story to the Daily Mail for $ 392,000 after carousing with the tabloid's reporters at a hotel. After she filed the libel action, Private Eye published two articles implying she knew about her husband's crimes. In the trial, which began May 19, Private Eye admitted there was no deal with the <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mail </ORGANIZATION> but claimed the gist of its statements was true: that Mrs. <PERSON> Sutcliffe </PERSON> negotiated with newspapers and was prepared to capitalize on her husband's crimes. Legal experts said the growth of libel awards would make newspapers reluctant to defend stories in court, for fear of high jury awards, and incline them to out-of-court settlements even on statements that were true. They and several national newspapers recommended changes in the libel laws, which allow juries to set damages without guidance from judges. In no other area of English civil law do juries have such great discretionary power. Plaintiffs in libel suits do n't ask for a specific sum, preferring not to limit the jury. `` In <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, you are now going down the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> route, which would allow punitive damages,'' said <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> <PERSON> Harper </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>'s judicial system, judges assess libel damages. `` Damages are there to compensate, not to punish,'' <PERSON> Harper </PERSON> said. `` We could suffer from all the deficiencies and defects of the American system which allow punitive damages to come in. They are unfair, they are inconsistent.'' Lord <PERSON> Blom-Cooper </PERSON>, chairman of the watchdog <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, agreed that `` the assessment of damages should be left to judges.'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Wakeham </PERSON>, Conservative majority leader, told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commons </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday the government was considering changes in the libel laws, but he was not specific. Newspapers said that if Mrs. <PERSON> Sutcliffe </PERSON>, 38, died before her husband, he would inherit the remainder of the award. <PERSON> Sutcliffe </PERSON> is in a hospital for the criminally insane. In it's editorial, the <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mirror </ORGANIZATION> said: `` The <LOCATION> Yorkshire </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ripper </LOCATION> has claimed his 14th victim _ justice.'' The Daily Express said the award made `` a mockery not only of the libel laws but of the system of justice itself.'' `` Mrs. <PERSON> Sutcliffe </PERSON> was right to fight for her reputation if she believed it maligned, but how on earth could a jury seriously believe that it was damaged to the extent of 600,000 pounds tax-free?'' the editorial said. `` As this award now sets a new record for libel damages, the jury must have thought the wrong done to her good name was the most grievous ever considered by our courts. In reality, it probably thought nothing of the kind.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Sutcliffe </PERSON> has not commented on the award. Her lawyer, <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Macgill </PERSON>, said Thursday: `` <PERSON> Sonia </PERSON> <PERSON> Sutcliffe </PERSON> was n't the person convicted. She is an entirely separate entity.'' The previous record for libel damages by a jury was $ 800,000 awarded to novelist and former politician <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Archer </PERSON> in July 1987 after the Star reported he had a sexual liaison with a prostitute and paid her hush money. American actress <PERSON> Koo </PERSON> <PERSON> Stark </PERSON> received $ 480,000 from the Sunday People last year because of false allegations that she dated Prince <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> after her marriage. Newspaper publisher <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> won $ 77,000 damages in 1986 from Private Eye, which said he financed overseas trips by <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Kinnock </PERSON> in hopes of receiving a peerage from a future <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> government. Pop star Elton <PERSON> John </PERSON> got received $ 1.6 million from the Sun, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s largest-circulation newspaper, which admitted its lurid allegations about his private life were false. That action was settled out of court in December. The judge scheduled to hear the case accused both sides of milking it for publicity.

 The sleeping deputies, docile votes and fulsome tributes to leaders are gone. In their place is vigorous, emotional debate with the sound of a political and moral reawakening in this vast land. Freed from the fear that permeated decades of authoritarian rule, citizens chose delegates to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s first competitively elected parliament. They hoped for change, and got it. As soon as the new <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION> convened on Thursday, deputy <PERSON> Vilens </PERSON> <PERSON> Tolpozhnikov </PERSON> of independent-minded <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION> took the floor. He requested a moment of silence for the 20 people killed last month when security forces broke up a peaceful nationalist demonstration in <LOCATION> Tbilisi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>. His appeal set the tone for a surging debate that expressed the feelings of of a diverse country that has spent four years under <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> probing its past and rediscovering politics, ethnic identities and national morality. `` Each of us wants to talk out a sea of emotion,'' deputy <PERSON> Konstantin </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lubenchenko </PERSON> said. Symbolizing the change, one of the first to take the floor was <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>, the 1975 Nobel Peace Prize laureate who only 2 -LCB- years ago was an internal exile confined to <PERSON> Gorky </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> made one of his most passionate speeches in response to tough questions about his privileges as leader, his position on ethnic conflicts and his plans for the future. `` We are still learning democracy,'' he said. `` We are still forming a political culture. We understand with our brains that it's necessary to change, but the system does n't let us.'' `` We have now reached the most difficult stage of perestroika,'' he said, referring to his `` restructuring'' program of economic and social change. A leader of his energy and candor could hardly be imagined in the days of such lumbering, silent figures as <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>, who even had himself given the nation's top literature prize in a campaign of self-glorification now openly reviled in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> media. On Thursday, young and businesslike deputies unseen in <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>'s time took the microphone to argue with conviction and detail. There was a sense of shame about the past, an earnest desire not to repeat the tragic mistakes. `` It's difficult for us all to live,'' said <PERSON> Valentina </PERSON> <PERSON> Petrovna </PERSON>, a deputy from <LOCATION> Irkutsk </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION>. `` Let's think hard, and not allow anybody to restructure the restructuring.'' <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Yavorivsky </PERSON>, a writer from <LOCATION> Kiev </LOCATION>, declared `` this will be the last time'' the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> people will allow a president to be elected without democratic opposition. Without change, he said, `` the people will turn away from us. They will go back to silence, to vodka and to their anecdotes.'' Five years ago, those were among the few comforts for citizens who watched a closed, secretive Kremlin choose the elderly, obviously infirm <PERSON> Konstantin </PERSON> <PERSON> U. </PERSON> <PERSON> Chernenko </PERSON> to replace the deceased <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Andropov </PERSON> as <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader. <PERSON> Chernenko </PERSON> pulled the country out of the 1984 <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> Olympics, backed off arms control negotiations with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and turned away from the tentative reforms begun by <PERSON> Andropov </PERSON>. Deputies in the new parliament said the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s standing in the world has been restored by what one called `` brilliant successes'' in diplomacy. Then they contrasted that with the performance at home: a rising budget deficit, continuing shortages, social tensions and speeches that lack the bold tone of the early <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> period. A deputy from <LOCATION> Kharkov </LOCATION> warned <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> not to act like the `` great <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON> who, fearing neither bullets nor death, led his people to victory, but due to sycophants and his wife ended with an empire, and not the republic he started with.''

<HEAD>Ag Expert Says low Mississippi River Could Trap Barges</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> transportation expert says the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> has not recovered from last year's drought and its reduced streamflow could bottleneck barges moving grain and soybeans into export this fall. T.Q. <PERSON> Hutchinson </PERSON> of the department's <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said a sharp upturn in demand for jumbo covered railroad cars and `` continued low-water conditions on the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> and lower <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> rivers will create a tight transportation situation for grain marketing.'' However, <PERSON> Hutchinson </PERSON> said there will be `` sufficient capacity'' available to meet the current export forecasts for feed grains and wheat. `` Replacement of Lock 26 at <LOCATION> Alton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, will close the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> for about one week in October-November 1989,'' he said. `` The closing, combined with low water and a tight rail car supply, could limit a post-harvest upturn in export shipments, but should not markedly disrupt grain distribution.'' <PERSON> Hutchinson </PERSON> said in a report that water levels for the lower <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> in the first four months of this year were well below those of the same period in 1988. However, the January-April levels averaged above those of the 1988 drought months, June through December. `` Navigation on the middle and lower segments of the river will probably remain impaired in 1989, as in 1988,'' he said. `` However, sufficient capacity exists to carry the volume of grain implied by current marketing estimates.'' <PERSON> Hutchinson </PERSON> said that between 1944 and 1988 the flood measure at <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, averaged 19.5 feet in April, falling to between 6 and 9 feet in September. Thus, he added, `` a substantial reduction in water depth can be expected to occur between spring and fall.'' Last year, the water level at <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> fell from 15.1 feet in April to 0.4 feet in September. The gauges do not indicate the channel's depth, but measure the quantity of water available. Channel depths are affected by dredging and other activities. In April, <PERSON> Hutchinson </PERSON> said, the flood gauges at <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> averaged 13.5 feet, nearly two feet below the previous year and six feet below the 1944-88 average for the month. `` In the coming months, flood gauges will likely reflect decreasing amounts of water, as they did last year,'' he said. `` Much of this will result from continuing low flows from the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>.'' Last year the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> supplied 65 to 70 percent of the flow at <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, he said. Normally, the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> would account for 45 percent. Although water releases in 1988 were below average, the Missouri's increased share of the flow stemmed from reductions in the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> and its tributaries. `` Currently, <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> reservoirs are 50 percent to 60 percent full,'' <PERSON> Hutchinson </PERSON> said. `` The <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> division -LRB- of the -RRB- <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION> plans to release slightly more water than last year _ but less than in a normal year.'' Also, he said, the <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION> plans a shortened navigation season this year because of the low levels of storage reservoirs. The river opened one week later and will close 25 to 30 days earlier than usual.

 Retail food prices in 1989 have been pushed up sharply by crop-biting cold weather in the first quarter and may gain an average of 5 percent to 7 percent over the entire year, according to an <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> forecast. That would compare with a 1988 average gain of 4.1 percent and would be the sharpest 12-month increase since 1981, when retail food prices rose 7.9 percent. `` Consumer demand will pull up food prices in 1989,'' the department's <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday. `` While growth in the general economy is slowing, growth in real disposable personal income is still likely to be 2 percent to 3 percent this year, after rising 2.9 percent last year.'' The report said the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s consumer price index for food increased at an annual rate of 8.6 percent in the first three months of 1989, well above the rate expected last fall. `` Additional upward adjustments are likely for the rest of this year, based primarily on the strength of consumer demand and the impact of higher petroleum prices,'' the report said. Much of the sharp rise in the first quarter was blamed on cold weather in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> which cut supplies of fresh vegetables. Retail prices, which had been expected to decline during the quarter, rose an average of 5.7 percent. Other price increases in the first quarter resulted from lingering effects of last summer's drought. `` Processed vegetable prices continued to rise because of smaller supplies of canned sweet corn, green peas, snap beans and dry beans, all victims of the drought,'' the report said. `` Smaller supplies of canned vegetables forced frozen vegetable prices higher as well.'' Retail egg prices rose 29.5 percent compared to a year earlier. Production was cut back because of high, drought-related feed costs, the report said. Food price increases are expected to be more moderate in the remainder of 1989. Prices for meats, poultry and fish `` will remain reasonably stable for the rest of the year,'' the report said. Egg prices are expected to fluctuate but should remain well above year-earlier levels.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> says private exporters have sold <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> an additional 150,000 metric tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat for delivery in the marketing year that will begin June 1. No selling prices or the names of the companies involved were announced. Wheat sales to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in the current 1988-89 marketing year total almost 8.3 million tons, officials said Thursday. A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 36.7 bushels of wheat. The 150,000 tons would be about 5.5 million bushels and, at recent prices of about $ 4.03 per bushel, would have a farm value of around $ 22 million.

<HEAD>Desperately Seeking Scroll: Schumer Asks State Department Help</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> needs to know more if it's going to help find a sacred Jewish scroll that was being smuggled from <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> when it was allegedly seized by officials in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION>. `` Without more information, there's no way that the department, which wants to be helpful, can be,'' a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official said Thursday, speaking on condition that his name not be used. `` There just does n't appear to be anywhere else to turn.'' Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, has asked the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to help recover the 150-year-old Persian Torah, which had been destined for a new Persian synagogue in <LOCATION> Queens </LOCATION>, N.Y. But the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has been unable to locate the holy book, the man who was transporting it or the official who allegedly confiscated the scroll in the tiny <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> emirate of <PERSON> Ras </PERSON> <PERSON> Alkheimeh </PERSON>. A spokesman for the Embassy of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION> did not return several phone calls Thursday. The Torah's owner, an <LOCATION> Iranian </LOCATION> woman, asked a friend of her husband in November 1988 to smuggle the sacred scroll to <LOCATION> Dubai </LOCATION>. Iranian law prohibits exporting a Torah, according to <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON>. The woman was sending the Torah to her brother in <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, who was planning to donate it to synagogue <PERSON> Beit </PERSON> <PERSON> Knesset </PERSON> <PERSON> Omid </PERSON>. `` We were going to have a grand opening at the synagogue and I was expecting to put this Torah at the grand opening,'' the brother said in an interview from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. He spoke on condition that his name not be used for fear that the Iranian government might retaliate against his family. The brother said the scroll had been in his family for generations. `` The value of this Torah, if you are Jewish, is priceless,'' he said. <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON> put its price in the tens of thousands of dollars if it is indeed 150 years old. The smuggler took the scroll by boat from a port in southern <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Dubai </LOCATION>, where he planned to mail it to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON> said. But in <PERSON> Ras </PERSON> <PERSON> Alkheimeh </PERSON>, the courier was stopped by government officials and the scroll was confiscated, <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON> said. In a letter to Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON> said he has learned that the person who seized the Torah was <PERSON> Javad </PERSON> <PERSON> Hadad </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Justice-Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON> provided a phone number for <PERSON> Hadad </PERSON>, but there was no answer there Thursday. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> consul in <LOCATION> Dubai </LOCATION> had tried to chase down <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON>'s leads to no avail. `` That name has been given before but they have not been able to track him down, as much as they've tried,'' the spokesman said. `` We're really at a stone wall right now.'' <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON> blamed the Torah's alleged confiscation on Arab anti-Semitism. `` It's a human rights issue,'' he said. `` I think they can be embarrassed because this is the most vulgar kind of anti-Semitism that could exist.''

<HEAD>World Affairs Are Getting Very Hard To Predict</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>

<BYLINE>AP Diplomatic Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Throw away your crystal ball. It's a topsy-turvy world. Events do n't turn out the way you might have supposed. Predictions are n't worth very much. Just look around. West German Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>, a conservative, is in the vanguard of West Europeans seeking disarmament and an accommodation with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. He's resisted the blandishments of President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and disrupted the script for the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> summit meeting to be held Monday and Tuesday in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> by demanding a negotiated reduction in short-range nuclear missiles. Brave <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> talk of a Western alliance able to withstand tensions can not obscure the fact that the usually reliable West Germans _ and not the independent <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> or a smaller left-leaning ally _ have opened a rift that challenges <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s very reason for being. If the time has come to negotiate the elimination of battlefield nuclear missiles in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> because the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> threat has receded, then <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s purpose is due for a reassessment. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was going to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the alliance. There still will be wall-to-wall photo-ops in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>, but behind the scenes, diplomats will be up late trying to paper over the U.S.-West German split with smiles and ambiguity. All in all, a strange turn of events. But not the only surprise on the world stage. Down in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, despite hopeful <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> predictions and a unanimous indictment by the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> that he was responsible for `` grave events and abuses,'' Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> clings to power, defying all efforts to dislodge him. More than a year ago, <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON>, then the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> assistant secretary of state for inter-American affairs, said <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was `` hanging by fingertips.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> regarded ousted <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> as the legitimate authority. However, <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>'s government ceased to exist 15 months ago, and <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is in effective control of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. He evidently still can depend on the military for support. Without the assistance of the generals, apparently there is no way for <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to force <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s ouster. He is still there, defying the odds and the predictions. In <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, President <PERSON> Najibullah </PERSON>, scorned by the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administrations as <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s inept puppet, is still in power without a single <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> soldier standing behind him. Rebels armed by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> were supposed to move in for the kill right after the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> withdrew. The troops left in mid-February, but <PERSON> Najibullah </PERSON> remains in charge in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. Could any seer have predicted only a few months ago the turmoil sweeping <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, the open defiance of generals ordered to move against student protesters, the democratic slogans from a people staggering under Marxist rule? That <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> would come to terms with the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>? That <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> would have a stock exchange? That the <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> would retain his grip on <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> well into his 80s? That <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> would end weapons shipments to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>? The Soviet leader, of course, has turned out to be the biggest surprise of all. He is not what the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had come to expect from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. Some 30 years ago <PERSON> Nikita </PERSON> <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON>, in a flurry of reform and showmanship, upset the West's balance. Since his downfall in 1964, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and its allies could count on a certain amount of predictability. Until <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> came along. He has kept the West off balance constantly. <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, who had dismissed the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> as an `` evil empire,'' wound up having five summit meetings with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and signing a landmark treaty to eliminate an entire category of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> nuclear missiles. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> apparently is still trying to figure out <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> response to Soviet arms control initiatives has been cautious. After all, there is no way of predicting what might happen next.

<HEAD>House Panel Blasts Pierce for Housing Subsidy Program</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto WX6</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Former Housing Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> provoked anger and disbelief among members of a congressional panel that questioned him about a housing subsidy program which investigators say was riddled with favoritism. <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>, who is now a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> lawyer, told congressional investigators Thursday that he was n't directly involved in deciding which projects received grants under the program. He said a committee of his subordinates at the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> selected the winners, and his approval was a rubber stamp. <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> said he was n't influenced by well-connected Republicans and former <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> officials who obtained a large portion of the multimillion dollar subsidy projects, acting as consultants or developers. `` Perhaps we should have watched the program closer than we did,'' <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> said, in the closest he came to acknowledging any blame. `` But we've got a whole department -LRB- to run -RRB- ...'' <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>'s appearance before a House Government Operations subcommittee marked his first public comment since an investigative report sharply criticized the management of a <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> program that provided indirect subsidies for rehabilitation of privately owned low-income housing projects. Current <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> has suspended further awards under the program pending a review. <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>, who headed <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> for eight years under former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, testified that he recommended <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> kill the so-called mod-rehab program. But his remarks stirred strong reaction among members of the subcommittee, which questioned him for more than two hours. When <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> suggested that Democrats had also profited from the program, a near-shouting match erupted with Rep. <PERSON> Barney </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Democrat charged that <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> was trying to `` deflect some of the blame'' by making `` irresponsible statements'' he could not back up. At one point during their exchange, <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> said, `` I do n't think ...'' and did not complete his sentence. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> shot back, `` Well, that has been clearer and clearer.'' Subcommittee Chairman <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON>, D-Calif., told <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> the suggestion that the Republican-appointed inspector general was protecting Democrats was `` difficult to fathom. Rep. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON>, D-Conn., told <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> that despite eight years in the Cabinet job, his remarks suggested `` you do n't really today understand how this program works. `` I did not have hands on,'' <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> responded. <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> Inspector General <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said an audit he conducted found a pattern in which former department officials and other well-connected Republicans received an inordinately large share of project awards. Among those cited was former <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Watt </PERSON>, who was reported receiving a $ 300,000 consulting fee on a <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> project. <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> acknowledged that department officials used their own discretion in awarding subsidies, but said that was because <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1984 waived requirements specifying fair-share allocation procedures.

<TEXT>
 House Democrats, anticipating a historic resignation next week of Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, are making plans for quickly promoting Majority Leader <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to the powerful speaker's post. But intrigue is brewing for filling in the rest of the party leadership slots as some Democrats worry that Rep. <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>, <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>'s likely successor, could hurt the party because of questions about his own financial dealings. <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, talking with reporters Thursday in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, said he spoke to <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> earlier in the day and the speaker `` repeated his desire to have an opportunity to state his case, his side of the case, to the widest possible audience, and he's determined to take that opportunity at the first time that seems appropriate.'' `` I assume that will be with either next week or shortly thereafter,'' <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> said. Leadership sources in the Capitol said arrangements were being made for <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> to make a resignation address to the House next Wednesday, but the speaker himself had not yet decided on his precise course of action. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, remained secluded in his office Thursday, but he released a statement making clear he no longer was seeking any `` plea bargain'' with the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics committee. One of the most serious charges made by the ethics committee was that <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Betty </PERSON>, was given a no-work job by <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s friend and business partner, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mallick </PERSON> House rules prohibit gifts from people with interest in legislation, and the committee said it believed <PERSON> Mallick </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> developer, had an interest. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, who has vowed to clear his wife's name, dispatched his attorneys on Wednesday in search of a deal that would accomplish that, according to sources who said the lawyers offered his resignation in exchange for the panel dropping at least the charges that involve his wife. But the deal fell through as Republicans and at least one Democrat on the panel resisted. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> on Thursday distanced himself from the effort and indicated it was over. `` There is no deal now. There will be no deal in the future,'' he said in the statement, insisting he had never personally engaged in the discussions. It remained unclear whether <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, if he resigned his speakership, would at the same time resign his seat in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> or if that would happen soon thereafter. The ethics committee would be forced to abandon its case only if <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> left the House. If <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> resigns his speakership, his party would quickly caucus to fill his post and the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> presumably would elect the popular <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, the No. 2 House Democrat. If <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> moved up to speaker, his post of majority leader would become vacant. <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>, D-Calif., would be next in line However, <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> recently admitted that he failed to include on his financial disclosure forms a $ 50,000 bank loan that he used toward purchasing junk bonds. On Thursday, the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is conducting a preliminary criminal investigation of whether <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> received favors from <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the firm that issued the junk bond. After the troubles surrounding <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, some lawmakers were privately promoting Rep. <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, D-Mo., for the majority leader's post <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> and <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> are political allies, but the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> Democrat did not rule out such a run. <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> press spokesman <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Johns </PERSON> said her boss is `` waiting to see what the speaker is going to do. He's listening to people and at this time he just has n't made a decision.'' Rep. <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON>, D-Ga., also was being mentioned for a leadership spot Contenders lining up for <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>'s No. 3 whip's spot, should he try to move up, included Rep. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonior </PERSON>, D-Mich., the current chief deputy whip, and <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caucus </ORGANIZATION> Chairman Rep. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, The politicking was taking place quietly. `` There's a certain amount of inappropriateness in mounting a campaign before the funeral,'' quipped Rep. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, D-Mont. Some Democrats were distressed at the turn of events, with the speaker seemingly being forced out before the ethics committee even moved into the phase of its proceedings during which <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> could testify and make his case. `` My heart is so heavy that this could happen to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION>,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Rangel </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, who in 1986 ran unsuccessfully for whip. <PERSON> Rangel </PERSON> said he was especially bothered by those members who have called for <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s resignation because he is embarrassing the House. `` I was outraged because, hell, there's nothing wrong with embarrassing other members of the damned <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said heatedly. `` I just ca n't think how you'd ask someone to damage the office and walk away from it without fighting like hell.''

 A Nobel laureate said Thursday that none of the scientists who spent three days discussing experiments on room-temperature fusion believes the research is a key to creating energy. However, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schrieffer </PERSON> said, chemists and physicists are finally talking to each other and are forming collaborations to work together on various cold fusion projects. The Workshop on Cold Fusion Phenomenon, attended by 440 researchers from 14 nations, concluded Thursday without reaching a consensus other than that researchers have a lot of work to do. Physicists, chemists, engineers and other scientists wrangled over the conclusions reached in numerous experiments performed in the two months since <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION> researchers announced they had produced nuclear fusion in a jar. The debate centers over the phenomenon of excess heat reported by the <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> researchers and the subsequent discovery of nuclear fusion indicators, such as neutrons, reported by other scientists trying to verify the <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> work. No one has reported both heat and nuclear particles, leading some to conclude that the <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> experiment did not produce cold fusion. <PERSON> Schrieffer </PERSON>, of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barbara </LOCATION>, said he believes the presence of heat without observed nuclear particles is a `` smoking gun'' in the <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> experiments. `` I personally do not believe the heat was from anything but a chemical process,'' he said at a news conference after the session ended. However, he also said he believes experiments that found evidence of a low level of neutrons or gamma rays indicated energy was coming from a fusion source, and those hold promise for scientific study. Fusion has long been touted as the possible energy source of the future. It would be clean because it produces virtually none of the radioactive waste associated with the fission reaction of nuclear power plants, and would be plentiful because the basic fuel would come from water. But <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Hackerman </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> member who co-chaired the conference, told the final session, `` Few of us, if any, look upon this source as a viable source of power.'' <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Brigham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Young </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> researcher whose cold fusion experiments have measured low rates of neutrons, also said he does not believe cold fusion will be a power source. `` It's a rose, not a tree,'' <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said. `` It's not going to give us energy, but it is beautiful.'' The cold fusion concept announced by <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION> chemist <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Pons </PERSON> and British colleague <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fleischmann </PERSON> on March 23 stirred the scientific world with its very simplicity. The researchers said they produced a fusion reaction in a simple apparatus. They ran electrical current through electrodes of palladium and platinum in a jar of heavy water, which is made with an isotope of hydrogen called deuterium. <PERSON> Pons </PERSON> and <PERSON> Fleischmann </PERSON> reported the release of heat which they attributed to nuclear fusion. They backed down from original claims they measured gamma rays, but have claimed subsequent experiments yielded up to 10 times more energy than was consumed. The two researchers did not attend this week's conference. Papers presented by researchers at <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> A & amp; M <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Brigham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Young </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alamos </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> and others reported measuring neutrons or gamma rays or the presence of tritium, but no excess heat. One group led by <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Huggins </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> reported heat, but did not test for the presence of nuclear byproducts. Others, such as <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION>, found no indications of heat or nuclear processes.

They talked Thursday about their initiation into a <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that seems obsessed with itself, its pay, its speaker, its ethics. Two months went into maneuvering over whether to take a 51 percent pay raise. Then came the rejected nomination, amid charges of booze and womanizing, of former <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> to be secretary of defense. There was the shabbiness of the <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Mack </PERSON> affair, the resignation of `` the most powerful aide on the Hill,'' the `` 436th congressman'' after a woman he brutally attacked years ago pointed a finger at him. And now what appears to be the inexorable removal of a speaker of the House for violating an ethics code that did n't exist when he came to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> 34 years ago. At the Capitol on a glorious morning it seemed obvious why <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> would be reluctant to give up his role as king of the Hill. It has been a wet, lush spring.

<HEAD>Tap Dancing Not Tapped Out Yet</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The rhythmic art of tap dancing, which nearly became extinct during the 1950s, is n't tapped out just yet, a joyful chorus line of dancers proved as they shim-sham-shimmied across the Golden Gate Bridge. `` There is a happiness there when I tap dance,'' said veteran hoofer <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Winston </PERSON>. `` There are very few ways that comes out of my body. It's a natural happiness that comes out of me. I have to tap to live.'' Although wind and salt air threatened to blow off their hats and sandblasters drowned out much of the performance, about 30 dancers hoofed it across the bridge Thursday to celebrate National Tap Dance Day. The national celebration coincided with the birthday of legendary staircase tapper <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> `` Bojangles'' <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, who was born on May 25, 1878, and died in 1949. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> `` </PERSON> <PERSON> Sandman </PERSON>'' <PERSON> Sims </PERSON> popularized the dance in muscial extravaganzas of the 1930s and 40s, and it later gained respectability on the stage at <LOCATION> Carnegie </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hall </LOCATION>. `` In the 1950s, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> choreographers made the decision not to put tap in Broadway musicals because it got more and more superficial, like a joke, with the big funky moves,'' said <PERSON> Rosie </PERSON>, of <PERSON> Rosie </PERSON> <PERSON> Radiator </PERSON> and the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> Supertappers, who helped resuscitate the form during the past two decades after it faded in the'50s. The troupe, led by <PERSON> Rosie </PERSON> in her red flared skirt, white tuxedo vest and sailor hat, is in the Guinness Book of World Records for longest tap dance _ a 7.3-mile performance. Tap, which blends African dance with the Irish jig and lively English clog, originated among black dancers performing on street corners and in saloons. Unlike ballet dancers, tap dancers hold their body limp like a rag doll and use the natural movements to belt out rhythms with their feet. `` It's the way kids move before their mother tells them to stop scraping their feet,'' said <PERSON> Rosie </PERSON>, describing the art of making music with your feet. `` The foot is like a musical instrument and today we are playing the bridge.'' Against a backdrop of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> skyscrapers and a vast expanse of water below, the tappers made their way across the six-land bridge, from <LOCATION> Marin </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> side, where they received a City Hall proclamation. `` Tap dancing is widely recognized as <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s only-original form of dance, yet for years it has been in danger of becoming a lost art,'' said Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Conyers </PERSON>, D-Mich., whose resolution was passed by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday declaring May 25 `` National Tap Dance Day. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approval is expected, he said in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <PERSON> D.C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Conyers </PERSON>, who admitted being a `` frustrated tap dancer'' soon to begin lessons, said former Bojangles dance partner <ORGANIZATION> Lloyd </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Story </ORGANIZATION>, 65, tried to tap on the floor of the House but was barred by the parliamentarian, who said it violated rules against demonstrations. On the bridge, <PERSON> Debby </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelehey </PERSON>, an escalator mechanic who practices on broken escalators in her cowgirl costume, passed the gold-sequined `` torch of tap'' during the single-file relay watched by wide-eyed drivers. `` I do n't care if I'm overweight and pushing 40. I feel like a star,'' she said, thrusting her arms out like <PERSON> Ethel </PERSON> <PERSON> Merman </PERSON>.

<HEAD>House Panel Passes Emergency Relief for Drought-Stricken Farmers</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> has approved emergency relief legislation to help farmers cope with drought devastation to their crops. The bill passed Thursday was originally intended to apply only to winter wheat crops, but numerous amendments offered by congressman in non-wheat states expanded it to include feed grains, cotton, rice, soybeans, peanuts, sugar beets, sugar cane and tobacco. Rep. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Glickman </PERSON>, D-Kan., chairman of the Agriculture subcommittee on wheat, soybeans and feed grains and chief architect of the legislation, said the inclusion of the other crops, which either have been affected by dry weather or are susceptible to future drought, was a `` political accommodation. `` We felt if we were going to come with a disaster program, we had only one bite of the apple,'' he said, recognizing that producers of crops other than wheat needed help but acknowledging that a multitude of legislation was not feasible. Agriculture Secretary <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> told the committee in a letter to <PERSON> Glickman </PERSON> that he would not recommend that President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> sign the bill unless it was `` budget neutral.'' In that case, it would have to apply only to 1989 crops affected by drought and be accompanied by a promise that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would agree to use crop insurance as the sole vehicle for disaster assistance after this year. `` I think we are in the ballpark,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Kika </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> la </PERSON> <PERSON> Garza </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, after the vote. The concern about crop insurance remains a stumbling block because farmers consider the current program unsatisfactory. `` I hope the secretary wo n't hold this bill hostage in order to pass crop insurance,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarpalius </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>. He said the current system, which requires farmers to pay insurance premiums to protect against the effects of bad weather, does n't work <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> la </PERSON> <PERSON> Garza </PERSON> pointed out that <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> improvements to the crop insurance bill would not be completed in time for action on this bill. But he said the progress <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is making should indicate that continued emergency relief such as this legislation will not be needed in the future. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON>, deputy agriculture secretary in charge of commodities, appeared before the committee to explain <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON>'s concerns After the vote, he said the secretary's first question would be, `` How much will it cost?'' De la <PERSON> Garza </PERSON> estimated that the bill would cost about $ 1 billion, an amount close to what the government will save in price support payments to farmers. An amendment to the bill offered by Rep. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Grandy </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Iowa </LOCATION>, prohibits disaster relief from exceeding the amount saved in price supports. Since the drought caused a shortage in commodities supply _ primarily wheat _ prices should rise, alleviating the need for government subsidies. The money that had been set aside for the price supports would therefore be used to pay the farmers who lost their crops to drought. The administration wants farmers to purchase crop insurance rather than depend on the government to bail them out when bad weather causes crop failures. The bill would require farmers to have insurance after this year to cope with bad weather or other natural disasters.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Montagna </PERSON> says a 15-pound salmon was small fry compared to the 9-year-old girl he saved from drowning. <PERSON> Montagna </PERSON>, 43, had landed the fish Sunday at the <LOCATION> Deschutes </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> when he saw little Amber <PERSON> Blankenship </PERSON> slip from a rock ledge into a treacherous sinkhole. `` I jumped in where I thought she'd be and went down too,'' <PERSON> Montagna </PERSON> said. When he surfaced from the 30-foot-deep river, the girl was nowhere to be seen. `` It was the sickest moment of my life. She could have been inches from my fingers.'' Moments later the girl popped out of the water about 12 feet away. <PERSON> Montagna </PERSON>, an ironworker, grabbed the girl and pulled her out of the water with the help of others on shore. Amber was n't breathing, but her heart was still beating, and she was revived, said her mother, <PERSON> Lola </PERSON> <PERSON> Blankenship </PERSON>. `` There are no thanks big enough for this gentleman,'' <PERSON> Blankenship </PERSON> said. `` Very few people come out alive because of the rocks. The river is so mean; it just boils.'' `` I was in the right place at the right time,'' <PERSON> Montagna </PERSON> said. The Deschutes runs through Bend in central <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, about 160 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> investigators, stymied so far in their search for accidental causes of last month's explosion aboard the battleship <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, are conducting a `` very thorough'' criminal investigation involving two shipmates who had a falling out, officials say. The officials, most of whom asked not to be identified, said no conclusive evidence has been developed suggesting criminal intent _ either homicide or suicide _ was behind the April 19 blast that killed 47 sailors. `` But there are some unusual aspects to the relationship between these sailors that is being investigated,'' said one source. `` We have no evidence to prove homicide or suicide here,'' added <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investigative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> agent in <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, where the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> is based. She described theories of homicide or suicide as `` possibilities among many possibilities.'' `` Let me put it this way,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s chief spokesman `` The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> is investigating all leads that it gets. It wants to be very thorough with this investigation.'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> agreed publicly Thursday that the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s inquiry had `` a criminal investigation aspect to it'' and that the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> was doing more than just helping the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> sift through forensic evidence. But he declined further discussion of the criminal inquiries. At the same time, <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> announced that investigators had ruled out another leading accident explanation for the explosion in the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>'s No. 2 gun turret: that the powder for the 16-inch gun had been rendered unstable by improper storage last summer. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> is still investigating why the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>'s powder was stored aboard hot, non-air-conditioned barges last summer during an overhaul. But <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said subjecting the powder to high temperatures affects its shelf life, not its stability. As for the criminal inquiry, the sources said investigators are looking into the relationship between 25-year-old Gunner's <PERSON> Mate </PERSON> <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON>, who died in the blast, and Gunner's Mate 3rd Class <PERSON> Kendall </PERSON> <PERSON> Truitt </PERSON>, 21, who survived. The two had been best friends and named each other as life insurance beneficiaries, but had a falling out last year when <PERSON> Truitt </PERSON> got married. <PERSON> Truitt </PERSON> stands to collect $ 100,000 from the life insurance policy on <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON>. <PERSON> Truitt </PERSON> worked at the bottom of the seven-level gun turret aboard the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> while <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON> worked at the very top, next to the huge guns. The only men to survive the explosion were those at the very bottom. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> has quoted unidentified sources as saying the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> is investigating the possibility that a detonating device was hidden in a burlap patch that gunners insert between bags of powder. The patches are designed to clean the barrels of the battleship's guns during firing. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> NIS </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday that in a search of <PERSON> Truitt </PERSON>'s home after the explosion, investigators found one of the burlap patches `` Yes, it was there, but it was n't tampered with,'' she said. `` It's a fact that people pick up items for memorabilia.'' A search of <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON>'s car last Monday, meanwhile, turned up a crude detonating device and the book `` How to Get Even Without Going to Jail,'' <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newsday </ORGANIZATION> reported Thursday. The book explains how to build booby traps and other deadly devices, according to sources the newspaper did not name. <PERSON> Truitt </PERSON> was quoted in reports last week as saying the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> created homicide or suicide explanations involving him and <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON> to make them scapegoats for an explosion investigators can not otherwise explain. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Holt </PERSON>, the father of a <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Myers </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, man killed in the explosion, said he also was skeptical of reports suggesting sabotage was behind the blast. <PERSON> Holt </PERSON> said he wondered `` if they're going to let those two guys take the blame to get it off the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s neck.'' His wife, <PERSON> Karla </PERSON> <PERSON> Holt </PERSON>, added, `` You have to wonder about whether -LRB- the suspected sailors -RRB- are scapegoats.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Holts </ORGANIZATION>' only son, <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Alan </PERSON>, was among the 47 people killed. <PERSON> Truitt </PERSON>, from <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, has said that in response to investigators' questions, he denied a homosexual relationship with <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON>. He is on leave from the ship and is being transferred to another post, <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said Thursday. <PERSON> Truitt </PERSON> arrived at <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> on Thursday night in the company of his wife and <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> attorney <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON>. <PERSON> Truitt </PERSON> refused to talk, but reporters asked <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> if his client had been charged. `` No, but there's been a lot of media accusations, and you've got to respond to them,'' <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> said `` So we're going to do that.''

<HEAD>Navy Investigating `Severe' Cracks in Hull of New Atomic Submarine</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CALLAHAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The discovery of two serious cracks is necessitating the replacement of part of the steel hull of a nuclear submarine under construction at a <LOCATION> Groton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, shipyard, the <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said. <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officials said Thursday they have opened an investigation into the cracks on the <LOCATION> Topeka </LOCATION>, a SSN-688 fast-attack sub. The problem in the Electric Boat shipyard is `` quite severe'' and `` a very unusual occurrence,'' the company said in a memo to lawmakers. `` A thorough investigation is being conducted which will include recommendations for repair,'' the memo said. `` <LOCATION> Topeka </LOCATION> will not put to sea until Electric Boat and the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> are fully satisfied that the vessel is safe.'' Electric Boat, a division of <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dynamics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, said workers discovered the cracks on the outer steel hull Monday afternoon during sandblasting operations in <LOCATION> Groton </LOCATION> and reported them to the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>. The hull is made at <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boat </ORGANIZATION>'s plant in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kingstown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> R.I. </LOCATION>, and assembled at the company's main plant in <LOCATION> Groton </LOCATION>. Company spokesman <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruenzel </PERSON>, reached late Thursday, said the memo may have `` overstated things as far as severity.'' <PERSON> Ruenzel </PERSON> said a `` very small section'' of the hull has been removed and will be replaced. `` It's quite severe from the standpoint that we would not let that matter go unattended and we felt and do feel that it was necessary to remove that section, not only for analysis but we would not deliver that submarine with cracks,'' he said. `` So the severity meant that the section needed to be replaced.'' `` It's a big job, but we're equipped to handle that,'' <PERSON> Ruenzel </PERSON> said. He provided no cost estimate and said he did not know if the replacement will delay the project. <PERSON> Ruenzel </PERSON> said he was unaware of any similar cracking of a submarine hull. <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> <PERSON> Pockros </PERSON>, an aide to Rep. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Gejdenson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Conn </LOCATION>., who represents the <LOCATION> Groton </LOCATION> district, said it was clear the cracks would force Electric Boat to push back its Sept. 30 commission date Lt. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman on submarine issues, said the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> had no immediate comment. The <LOCATION> Topeka </LOCATION>, designated SSN-754, is a 360-foot, 6,900-ton, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles-class </LOCATION> submarine. The vessels, designed to hunt down enemy subs and surface warships, are armed with <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> 48 anti-submarine torpedoes, Harpoon missiles and Tomahawk cruise missiles. Construction of the <LOCATION> Topeka </LOCATION>, ordered by the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> in 1983, was begun on Jan. 23, 1988. It is scheduled to be commissioned on Sept. 30. The Los Angeles-class submarines are built by Electric Boat and the <ORGANIZATION> Newport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION> -RRB- Shipbuilding Co. The last SSN-688 is expected in the 1990 fiscal budget. The subs will be replaced by the SSN-21 Seawolf. <PERSON> Ruenzel </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Armco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Parsippany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, supplied the steel on the part of the hull that cracked. `` It is too premature to identify any financial liabilities,'' the memo said. `` Results of a complete investigation will be required.''

<HEAD>Haughey Calls For Election</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Prime Minister <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Haughey </PERSON> has called a general election for June 15 in a bid to capitalize on <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>'s economic revival and win his first outright parliamentary majority in five attempts His minority government, elected 28 months ago by the slimmest margin possible, announced the election Thursday. <PERSON> Haughey </PERSON>, 63, is midway through a maximum five-year term. His fiscal austerity has brought a turnaround from harsh recession, reflected in a low inflation rate of 3.3 percent, a trade surplus and a moderate economic growth rate. His Fianna Fail Party will form the first single-party majority government since 1977-81 if its 50 percent-plus approval rating in recent opinion polls is reflected in the election. Critics say opposition parties, led by the main opposition Fine Gael under its new leader <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukes </PERSON>, are in disarray and unable to offer a credible alternative. But with interest rates creeping up this month to 9.25 percent and signs inflation may rise, <PERSON> Haughey </PERSON> wants to try for an outright parliamentary majority before the economic situation deteriorates. Critics complain that the improvements in this island republic of 3.4 million people are not filtering through to the poor and the young. Unemployment remains at 17.9 percent and emigration, at an estimated 32,000 a year, is at its highest level since the 1950s. Government officialssay <PERSON> Haughey </PERSON> wants to discard minority government status before <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> assumes the six-month rotating presidency of the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> on Jan. 1. His staying power, charisma and political mastery have long confounded his opponents. <PERSON> Haughey </PERSON> has won and lost office twice. In February 1987, <PERSON> Haughey </PERSON> led party to less than a majority in the Dail, or parliament, sneaking in on the vote of one left-wing maverick. In 1970, <PERSON> Haughey </PERSON>, then finance minister, was acquitted on charges of conspiring to smuggle guns to <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> rebels fighting British rule in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. He was fired from government, but returned to a series of high party posts before leading the party to power in 1979. Scandal blighted <PERSON> Haughey </PERSON>'s 1982 administration. An aide accused of stuffing ballot boxes was acquitted on a technicality, two unsympathetic journalists found their telephones were tapped and a murder suspect was found in the attorney general's home. Party dissidents mounted a campaign to oust him, but <PERSON> Haughey </PERSON> outmaneuvered them. They are now gone, and Fianna Fail under <PERSON> Haughey </PERSON> is once again unified.

 The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> says it will defend a pair of <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> veterans if the government prosecutes them for arranging trips to <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> to heal `` old, deep wounds'' from the war they fought there two decades ago. The announcement Thursday came just one day after the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reaffirmed its intention to pursue a vigorous enforcement program against violations of embargoes that it says prohibit Americans from promoting or arranging unauthorized travel to <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brenda </PERSON>, legislative analyst with the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> office of the <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION>, said `` The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is simply without authority to reach directly into the First Amendment-protected activities of Americans in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and prevent them from organizing towards the perfectly legal end of travel to <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>.'' Ms. <PERSON> Brenda </PERSON> appeared at a news conference with <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Mills </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Myers </PERSON>, members of the <ORGANIZATION> Vietnam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> chapter in <LOCATION> Akron </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. The two men have organized six bargain-rate tours of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> for veterans since 1984, and they said they will go ahead with another in November. `` We believe that an attempt to prosecute <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veterans for traveling back to <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> in an effort to learn about present-day <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and heal old, deep wounds would be a grave mistake,'' Ms. <PERSON> Brenda </PERSON> said. `` Should the government proceed along that course, however, we will assist these veterans in their legal defense.'' It is legal for Americans to travel to <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, but the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> issued regulations last year making it illegal to `` arrange, promote, or facilitate group or individual tours or travel'' to any country listed under the Trading with the Enemy Act. This list now includes <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mills </PERSON> and <PERSON> Myers </PERSON> began organizing tours of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> after <PERSON> Mills </PERSON> revisited the country in 1984 as a member of the national board of <ORGANIZATION> Vietnam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, which was looking into controversies over the defoliant Agent Orange and the issue of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> servicemen missing in action. <PERSON> Mills </PERSON> said that when he spoke to chapters of the organization upon his return, he found them mainly interested in hearing what <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> is like now. Two veterans who have gone on the tours spoke glowingly of their experiences at the news conference. `` I found out that despite all of our efforts we were n't able to kill the whole country,'' said <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Kleven </PERSON>, 40, of <LOCATION> Concord </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's still alive. Alive and well.'' <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> McCausland </PERSON>, 38, of <ORGANIZATION> Munroe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Falls </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, an <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> veteran who lost an arm and a leg in a rocket attack in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, said `` The image that I have of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> now is of a peaceful green little country, where the image I had before was of a place that was deadly.'' `` It would be a real shame to allow anybody to prevent other veterans from going through the same process,'' <PERSON> McCausland </PERSON> said. <PERSON> McCausland </PERSON> said he believed it would be nearly impossible for most veterans to return to <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> on their own because of the expense and paperwork involved. <PERSON> Myers </PERSON> said the organized tours last about three weeks `` from home town to home town'' and cost $ 2,700, including transportation, meals and accommodations. <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinter </PERSON>, chief of licensing for the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assets </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION>, wrote <PERSON> Mills </PERSON> and <PERSON> Myers </PERSON> on Feb. 10 directing them to `` immediately terminate performing any activities involving travel tours to <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>.'' The letter said violation of the regulations carries a maximum penalty of a $ 50,000 fine and 10 years imprisonment. On May 15, <ORGANIZATION> Lindblad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Travel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Westport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, pleaded guilty in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> to unlawfully arranging a group tour of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. Sentencing was set for June 14. One of the customers booking the tour was an undercover agent of the <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. In a news release about the <PERSON> Lindblad </PERSON> case on Wednesday, <PERSON> Salvatore </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Martoche </PERSON>, assistant secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> for enforcement, said, `` This case should send a strong message that violations of the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> sanctions program will not be tolerated.'' <PERSON> Martoche </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assets </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> `` will continue to work closely with the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> to pursue a vigorous enforcement program against violations of these and other embargoes.''

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration officials are trying to decide how to handle a congressman's threat to hold up aid for <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> unless officials concede they misled lawmakers about <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> efforts to win third-country help for Nicaraguan rebels. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and White House officials met Thursday to discuss a letter Rep. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Obey </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Wis </LOCATION>., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Appropriations subcommittee on foreign operations, sent to Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, said a congressional source who asked not to be named An administration official confirmed discussions were being held on the letter. Obey complained that his committee, which acts on the administration's requests for foreign aid, `` was clearly misled by administration spokesmen in the past concerning the linkage of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid to the Contras.'' He asked <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> to provide him with a letter `` for the record to show that the administration understands that, so we can move on to other business.'' `` I would hope that this matter could be cleared up by a simple letter so that further hearings would not be required before we'' vote on aid to <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, he said. Obey pointed out that time is short, since the vote is expected to take place within the next two weeks. Further hearings could delay the vote on the administration's request for some $ 700 million in Central American aid for fiscal 1990, said an Obey aide, who spoke on condition of anonymity The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has backed the Contra rebels since 1981 in their fight to oust the leftist government in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. Documents that surfaced at former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aide <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s recent trial and other information `` would seem to justify a committee conclusion that aid to <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> was used as leverage to get those countries to help the Contras'' and circumvent a 1984 congressional ban on such assistance, Obey wrote. He also noted that <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Kozak </PERSON>, acting assistant secretary of state for <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, testified before Obey's panel last month that a plan to expedite aid to <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> in return for its promise to help the rebels was never carried out. `` But clearly it was,'' Obey said. <PERSON> Obey </PERSON> said he wrote to <PERSON> Kozak </PERSON> asking him to clear up discrepancies between his testimony and other documents, but did not receive an answer. `` If the administration has other documents which can back up'' <PERSON> Kozak </PERSON>'s contentions, they should be supplied to the committee immediately, <PERSON> Obey </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Appeals Court Seeks Review of Challenge to Workload at Overseas School</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A federal appeals court is calling for a review of a labor union's challenge to increase teaching workloads at overseas schools. At issue are additional duties for teachers at 250 schools for children of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military personnel, operated by a unit of the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. The appeals court on Thursday reversed a decision of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> that had supported the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s refusal to bargain with the teachers about the extra work. `` The Authority never measured the impact of management's changes upon the ... employees,'' said the ruling by <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Spottswood </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> In 1984, administrators with the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dependent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Schools </ORGANIZATION> announced changes that would reduce hiring of substitute teachers, thereby requiring full-time teachers were to fill in. Hiring of outside help to monitor lunchrooms and playgrounds also would be discontinued, with full-time teachers and professionals handling these chores. Additional work was subsequently instituted for compensatory education programs as well. The <ORGANIZATION> Overseas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> submitted proposals designed to minimize the effect of the changes. <PERSON> DODDS </PERSON> bargained on some of them, but refused to do so on others. The Labor Relations Authority upheld the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> unit, saying the union's proposals interfered directly with management's reserved right to assign work. The union, however, said its proposals qualified for bargaining because they involved adversely-affected employees. The extra duties, said the union, forced the teachers do some work on their own time at home. `` The Authority missed the point completely,'' said the judge. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> and two judges who concurred in a separate opinion reversed the Authority's decisions and sent the cases back for further consideration.

A survey released by a congressional subcommittee Thursday shows widespread discontent among the men and women who sit at screens and help guide the airplanes from airport to airport. `` Morale is horrible, traffic intolerable, management insensitive; we're overworked, understaffed and abused,'' said one unidentified controller who responded to the survey by the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>. An air traffic control supervisor was quoted as saying there are busy hours at major hubs `` when the system teeters on the brink of being unsafe.'' Sixty-five percent of controllers responding to the survey felt they handled too much traffic, 59 percent thought they were required to work too long without a break, and 43 percent said their morale was low. The survey by <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION>, which is <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' investigative arm, was based on 5,098 questionnaires filled out late last year by controllers and supervisors at the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>'s 84 largest facilities. Those responding made up about one-third of the workforce. The survey included analysis by an independent consulting group, the <ORGANIZATION> Flight </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, that said the system is safe but the margin of safety is narrow. The report detailing results of the survey was titled `` Serious Problems Continue to Trouble the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Traffic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Work </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>.'' The results indicate that little has changed in the system since 1985 when a similar survey was conducted with nearly identical responses. The latest figures on air traffic controllers show their number has for the first time exceeded the 16,244 that worked before a 1981 strike that brought the firing of 70 percent of the workforce. But House members said and the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> confirmed that there are still 3,600 fewer `` full performance controllers'' than eight years ago, and their number recently has dwindled further. The controllers qualified to handle radar and other critical tasks numbered 9,689 at the end of last month, compared to 9,858 last Sept. 30 when the controller survey was completed. Sitting at a computer terminal in his office that shows the minute-by-minute location of every commercial flight over the continental <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> praised the system. Before demonstrating the terminal, which is hooked up to the air traffic control system, <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> said he has talked to more controllers around the country than any previous secretary and believes morale is high. He acknowledged some discontent over inadequate pay scales at larger, more complex operations, and said morale is affected somewhat by outdated equipment. `` The system is bulging at the seams, but it's still the safest system in the world,'' <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> said. Acting <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> head <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Whittington </PERSON> told the subcommittee the agency's own surveys show high employee job satisfaction. `` Overall, the morale of our controller work force is good, although it varies from facility to facility and does not remain static over time,'' <PERSON> Whittington </PERSON> said. The survey said traffic volume has grown by 30 percent to 40 percent at major airports since the controllers' strike. `` Our equipment level is, in a word, prehistoric,'' said one controller quoted by <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> official <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mead </PERSON>, who summarized the survey for the subcommittee. <PERSON> Mead </PERSON> said controllers and supervisors were given assurances of confidentiality when they filled out the survey forms.

<DATELINE>TINY TOWN, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A miniature city built 75 years ago as a play town for a businessman's daughter opens Saturday after a sprucing up, and its operators hope it will once again be a top tourist attraction. <LOCATION> Tiny </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> is located about five miles southwest of <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> and boasts more than 70 buildings. Many are miniature replicas of <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> historical buildings such as the city's first fire station, the first telephone office, Mrs. <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Boarding </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, some landmark mansions and some businesses. Twenty of the buildings _ most of which are little taller than an adult's waist _ are the originals that <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> built for his daughter as a fantasy village beginning in 1915. On a hillside across <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> from the main village are several replicas of old mining structures similar to those still in place around such historical mining towns as Central City and <LOCATION> Cripple </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION>. On Saturday, a <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ballet </LOCATION> performance in the tiny village once known as <LOCATION> Turnerville </LOCATION> will mark <ORGANIZATION> Tiny </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Town </ORGANIZATION>'s emergence from the tall mountain weeds that shrouded it for several years. Tiny Town was closed for the better part of five years for renovation by volunteers working for the non-profit <ORGANIZATION> Tiny </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Town </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>. The town was opened to the public on selected weekends last summer, and when 11,000 people visited during the first one, the group decided it better prepare for bigger crowds than anticipated. Research indicates it is the oldest miniature town in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, says <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Kintzele </PERSON>, a longtime <ORGANIZATION> Tiny </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Town </ORGANIZATION> fan who helped with the restoration. The village is still for children, said <PERSON> Kintzele </PERSON>. `` They come up here and you do n't have to tell them this is for kids,'' he said. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>'s creation, which grew from a few small buildings in 1915 to about 125 by 1925, was one of the state's top three tourist attractions behind <ORGANIZATION> Buffalo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cody </ORGANIZATION>'s grave and <PERSON> Pike </PERSON>'s Peak At one time, a tiny working railroad wound its way around the town and back and forth across <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> on miniature trestles. The steam-powered locomotive had a miniature roundhouse where it turned around and spent the winter. Tiny Town survived damaging floods in 1929 and 1932 and a fire that swept up <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canyon </LOCATION> in 1935, destroying the principal buildings, although leaving the miniature buildings intact. In 1969 a flood left behind a debris-strewn ghost town. The biggest disaster was in 1948 when <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> 285, which ran next to <LOCATION> Tiny </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>, was rerouted, taking the village `` out of sight, out of mind,'' <PERSON> Kintzele </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>, who ran a moving company, sold the town in 1927. One of the town's restorations was by <PERSON> Lyle </PERSON> <PERSON> Fulkerson </PERSON>, who bought the town in 1972. <PERSON> Fulkerson </PERSON>, a model train buff and master mechanic, widened and deepened <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> to prevent furture floods and regraded the railroad bed. But five years later, <PERSON> Fulkerson </PERSON> was killed when his car was hit by a runaway train while he was traveling from <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Tiny </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>. The next year <ORGANIZATION> Tiny </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Town </ORGANIZATION> lost its lease and fell into disrepair. It was closed to the public in 1983. Age also took its toll on the Tiny Town Railroad. The caboose and a few cars are still usable, but the track and track bed need replacing and the locomotive must be rebuilt, with parts impossible to find, said <PERSON> Kintzele </PERSON>. He said it would cost $ 100,000 to put the railroad back in operation. That part of the operation is still in the future, he said. The train, made on a bigger scale than the rest of the town to accommodate children, `` who are n't one-sixth scale,'' wo n't run during the 1989 season, but will be there for visitors to see, he said.

 A man who killed a widow and stole her Christmas presents was executed in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>'s electric chair early Friday after the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> denied his appeal. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Lindsey </PERSON>, 28, was the fourth person executed in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> and the 111th in the nation since the 1976 <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling allowing states to resume capital punishment. <PERSON> Lindsey </PERSON> stared at Warden <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> as the death warrant was read. Asked whether he wanted to say anything, <PERSON> Lindsey </PERSON> shook his head. He was declared dead at 12:10 a.m., prison officials said. The high court rejected <PERSON> Lindsey </PERSON>'s appeal Thursday despite dissents by Justices <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Thurgood </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>, said court spokeswoman <PERSON> Toni </PERSON> <PERSON> House </PERSON>. Both justices oppose capital punishment. <PERSON> Lindsey </PERSON> had no reaction to the court's decision, said prison spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hale </PERSON>. <PERSON> Lindsey </PERSON> spent his final hours in Holman Prison with chaplain <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>, who had said <PERSON> Lindsey </PERSON> was taking it `` very well, very quiet,'' <PERSON> Hale </PERSON> said. Earlier, Gov. <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON>, a Primitive Baptist preacher, refused to grant clemency to <PERSON> Lindsey </PERSON>. `` The governor declines to alter the decision of the jury and the courts,'' said <PERSON> Stacey </PERSON> <PERSON> Rimer </PERSON>, <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON>'s assistant press secretary. <PERSON> Lindsey </PERSON> was convicted in the 1981 stabbing and shooting death of 64-year-old <PERSON> Rosemary </PERSON> <PERSON> Zimlich </PERSON> <PERSON> Rutland </PERSON> in Mobile. The 11th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday found no merit in <PERSON> Lindsey </PERSON>'s request for a stay, according to court spokesman <PERSON> Matt </PERSON> <PERSON> Davidson </PERSON>. The governor's legal adviser, <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Wasden </PERSON>, said before <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON>'s decision that clemency could only be granted if there were `` evidence that was not presented at the trial that was so overwhelming as to preclude every other possibility but innocence. <PERSON> Wasden </PERSON> and the governor's chief of staff, <PERSON> Holman </PERSON> <PERSON> Head </PERSON>, met Wednesday with <PERSON> Lindsey </PERSON>'s sister and spoke by telephone with his mother, who lives in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. The governor, who is traveling around the state, did not attend the meeting Mrs. <PERSON> Rutland </PERSON> was killed Dec. 14, 1981. She was bound, gagged, stabbed and shot, and Christmas presents were taken from her home. Police investigators said <PERSON> Lindsey </PERSON> was captured at a shopping mall using the victim's credit cards. <PERSON> Lindsey </PERSON> lived in a rental house directly behind Mrs. <PERSON> Rutland </PERSON>'s home Mobile County District Attorney <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Galanos </PERSON> said <PERSON> Lindsey </PERSON> killed the woman because she recognized him. <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>'s last electrocution was Aug. 28, 1987, when <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Ritter </PERSON> was put to death for his non-triggerman role in the robbery and killing of a Mobile pawn shop owner.

<HEAD>Americans Learning More About AIDS' Causes</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Americans are learning more about AIDS but it may be years before this increased knowledge slows the spread of the disease, according to a federal study. The one-year survey of public awareness by the federal <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION> showed an increase of people who know AIDS is spread through sexual intercourse and not from casual contact with infected persons. But people can be infected with the AIDS virus for 10 years before symptoms appear, complicating detection of the disease, said <PERSON> Marcie </PERSON> <PERSON> Cynamon </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> NCHS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Division </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interview </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION> near <LOCATION> Bethesda </LOCATION>, Md. The study released Thursday was based on about 3,500 interviews a month from August 1987 to August 1988 and administered by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION>'s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report said that the percentage of parents who discussed AIDS with their children remained constant at about 60 percent but that those reporting their children had AIDS education in schools was up from 36 percent to 59 percent. Over the period of the survey, the percentage of adults correctly answering that it was `` definitely true'' that AIDS was an infectious viral disease increased from 44 percent to 64 percent. Other findings of the study included: _ Those who knew it is very unlikely or impossible to contract AIDS by working near someone who has the disease increased from 53 percent to 67 percent _ The percentage of people putting considerable trust in the use of condoms or restricting relations to one uninfected partner remained basically unchanged in the 92 percent range _ The percentage of people saying they knew `` a lot'' or `` some'' about AIDS increased from 60 to 66 percent _ Those feeling they have no chance of getting the AIDS virus increased from 60 percent to 75 percent _ Those answering correctly that AIDS can be transmitted through intercourse with an infected person increased from 75 percent to about 85 percent

 A high school student's effort to honor two classmates killed in a car accident ended in his own death when a 500-pound soccer goal post toppled onto him as he placed a memorial wreath on top of it. <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldfarb </PERSON>, 17, a junior from Stow, died at <LOCATION> Clinton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> where he was taken after the accident Thursday morning. <ORGANIZATION> Nashoba </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> Principal <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Pawluk </PERSON> said <PERSON> Goldfarb </PERSON> and several other students were distraught over the deaths of classmates <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Rausch </PERSON> and <PERSON> Joanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Basteri </PERSON>. <PERSON> Rausch </PERSON> and <PERSON> Basteri </PERSON> were killed Wednesday night when the car they were riding in struck a tree. `` Today some kids were having trouble coping with that. In their grief and sorrow, they'd walk out to the soccer field and just sit and cry out there,'' <PERSON> Pawluk </PERSON> said. `` -LRB- <PERSON> Goldfarb </PERSON> -RRB- was climbing on the goal to leave something there as a remembrance.

<HEAD>Many Doctors Say They Would Deceive Patients</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Many doctors say they would lie to a patient's family if their errors had led to the patient's death, a study on deception in the medical profession shows The survey published today in the Journal of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said many doctors would engage in various forms of deception to help themselves or to protect patients. The lead researcher said the results should not signal distrust in physicians. `` People who read the study superficially might think, ` My god, you ca n't trust your doctor anymore; they're deceptive,''' said Dr. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Novack </PERSON>. `` I would challenge that,'' said <PERSON> Novack </PERSON>, an associate professor of community health at <ORGANIZATION> Brown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Providence </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> R.I. </LOCATION>. More than two-thirds of doctors surveyed indicated a willingness to help patients get insurance benefits by misrepresenting a test, according to the study Doctors `` appear to justify their decisions in terms of the consequences and to place a higher value on their patients' welfare and keeping patients' confidences than on truth-telling for its own sake,'' the researchers said. But `` under extreme circumstances, some physicians would consider deceiving to benefit themselves.'' More than one-third of the doctors surveyed for the article indicated they would offer incomplete or misleading information to the family of a very sick patient after making a mistake that led to the patient's death. Such behavior is not necessarily unethical, said <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Callahan </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Hastings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Briarcliff </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Manor </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, a research institute that studies ethical problems in medicine. <PERSON> Callahan </PERSON>, a non-physician, was not involved in the study. `` I think it is inevitable physicians are fallible, and we need to understand their fallibility,'' he said. `` I think they do n't have to reveal their errors to patients. <PERSON> Novack </PERSON> said 80 percent of respondents indicated they `` rarely or never'' use deception in their own practices. The hypothetical cases posed `` some of the hardest cases they could have,'' he said in a telephone interview Thursday. The researchers presented four hypothetical problems to 211 physicians in an unspecified Northeast state. The doctors answered multiple-choice questions about what courses of action they would choose and why. More than half of the doctors said they would permit a patient who had contracted gonorrhea from a prostitute to mislead his wife _ not the doctor's patient _ about the nature of the disease. The deception involved letting the patient tell his wife the disease was a non-specific urethritis not acquired through sex. That way, the patient could have his wife get treatment without jeopardizing his marriage. Less than 10 percent of the physicians said they would deceive a mother to avoid revealing an adolescent daughter's pregnancy, while more than 30 percent said they would leave the decision entirely up to the girl. <PERSON> Callahan </PERSON> said tradition favors allowing the patient to decide. `` If there's any firm rule in medicine _ probably the most firm rule _ it is that doctors need to maintain patient confidentiality,'' he said in a telephone interview. `` Refusing to break a medical confidence has never been called deception.''

 A 13-year-old boy arrested in the morning with a loaded automatic handgun went back to police in the evening asking for his gun back. `` He made the trip to come down here to inquire about his gun so I would at least think that he was serious,'' said Lt. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Lacorazza </PERSON>. In 15 years as a transit police officer, <PERSON> Lacorazza </PERSON> said, he's never seen anything like it `` Basically he was informed that the gun is evidence in the investigation and he could n't have it.''

As the officer was questioning him, the boy `` made a move inside his jacket toward his waist,'' <PERSON> O'Leary </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 The summer travel season gets under way with the Memorial Day holiday weekend and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> predicts that up to 470 people would die in traffic accidents. `` Traditionally, Memorial Day means increased traffic on the highways,'' <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Hyland </PERSON> of the Chicago-based council said Thursday. The holiday travel period begins at 6 p.m. Friday and runs until midnight Monday. The safety council predicted that between 370 and 470 people would die in traffic accidents. Last year there were 404 traffic fatalities for the three-day weekend. The Memorial Day record was set in 1968 when 629 people were killed in traffic accidents over a four-day weekend. The three-day record of 597 was set in 1969. Although gasoline prices have risen nationwide in the past two months, the safety council said it was unable to say whether that would keep more people off the highways. `` It's hard to say,'' said <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> of the council's statistical bureau `` Nobody knows for sure. If the mileage goes down, the accidents and fatalities would go down. But nobody knows how the public will react to the increased prices.''

<HEAD>Dollar Falls Sharply in Tokyo, Stocks Soar</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The dollar fell sharply against the Japanese yen in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> today, sending stock prices soaring to a record high, traders said. The dollar, which had risen 2.95 yen between Monday and the end of trading Thursday, finished the week at 140.40 yen, down 1.95 yen from Thursday's close of 142.35 yen. After opening sharply lower at 140.85 yen, the dollar ranged during the day between 139.90 and 141.10 yen. Dealers attributed the dollar's decline to growing cautiousness about its recent rise. `` Most players were beginning to feel the dollar was going up too far too fast,'' said <PERSON> Masato </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanjo </PERSON>, a dealer at the <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> office of <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hanover </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION>. `` Also, widespread speculation that the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> will increase its discount rate contributed to the dollar's decline.'' The nationally circulated newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Asahi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shimbun </ORGANIZATION> reported today that the central bank planned to lift its official discount rate by 0.75 percentage points to 3.25 percent on Wednesday. <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> officials declined to comment on the report. On the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the 225-issue Nikkei Stock Average, which gained 153.57 points Thursday, rose another 186.23 points, or 0.55 percent, to close the week at 34,191.62, another record high. Dealers said the rebound in the yen motivated investors to buy shares which had lost ground this week due to the dollar's sharp rise. `` The market environment is improving,'' said a dealer at a major Japanese brokerage who spoke on condition of anonymity. `` Once the domestic political situation settles down, I think we can expect another rally.'' Volume on the market's first section was estimated at 700 million shares, the same as Thursday.

 Deputies to the new Soviet congress today quarreled over legal restrictions on demonstrations after a deputy complained that anti-riot forces were deployed to break up a public meeting. Conservatives won the fight, and a ban on public gatherings in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> remained in effect. Minutes after the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION> convened for a second day, sociologist <PERSON> Tatyana </PERSON> <PERSON> Zaslavskaya </PERSON> told her colleagues that voters had called her early today to report that special forces broke up a gathering on <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s Pushkin Square. She said the crowd had assembled to meet deputies from the new congress and demanded the body vote to lift a ban on unauthorized public gatherings for the duration of the congress' inaugural session. Soviet law permits city authorities to ban parades and demonstrations to maintain public order. The restrictions often are invoked against unofficial political activities. <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Mityunov </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, a self-styled opposition party with a few thousand members across the country, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> that Thursday's late-night meeting was called to appeal for more democracy and to meet <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> deputies. There were no arrests, but the police `` behaved very aggressively,'' he said. <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, who was chosen president by the congress on Thursday, called Interior Minister <PERSON> Vadim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakatin </PERSON> to the podium after <PERSON> Zaslavskaya </PERSON>'s speech. <PERSON> Bakatin </PERSON> said voters had gathered nationwide to discuss the first day of the congress and no incidents were reported. But the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> meeting was different, he said, because city authorities had banned it in advance. <PERSON> Bakatin </PERSON>'s statement touched off a noisy quarrel on the floor of the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, whose televised proceedings are part of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s democratic reforms. Conservatives from <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> applauded loudly to drown out podium statements by <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> reformers <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> <PERSON> Stankevich </PERSON> and <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>, the human rights activist. <PERSON> Stankevich </PERSON>, 35, said he went to the square, which in recent months has become a gathering place for political debate and frequent site of demonstrations, and found more than 2,000 people surrounded by police and special anti-riot forces. <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> said he went to the square Thursday night after a crying girl telephoned him from the site. `` I spoke to these people, it was a very good conversation about the problems of the congress,'' he said. `` These are our young people, our future, actively interested in the congress. They asked us to go there every day after the end of debates.'' `` We must not surround these people with police units,'' <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> said, recalling that at least 20 people died in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> last month after security forces broke up a pro-independence demonstration. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, as presiding officer of the congress, moved to resolve the dispute by putting to a vote Ms. <PERSON> Zaslavskaya </PERSON>'s request that <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> city authorities lift the ban on unauthorized public meetings while the congress meets. During the balloting, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> announced he had received word from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> Communist Party boss <PERSON> Lev </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Zaikov </PERSON> that city authorities would permit meetings at <LOCATION> Luzhniki </LOCATION>, a large park and stadium area in western <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. That did not satisfy <PERSON> Mityunov </PERSON>, who said his group will meet in <LOCATION> Pushkin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> anyway, and the conservatives in the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> held sway. The vote was 1,261-831 against lifting the ban; 30 deputies abstained.

 Technicians today prepared a <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> 2 for its fifth launch attempt as troubleshooters studied an electrical problem that stopped the rocket a second before liftoff. <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> officials predict it will be at least Wednesday before they try again to launch the $ 20 million <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> 2, which is to carry a military navigation satellite into orbit for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and its allies. Experts concluded Thursday that an electrical problem at the launch pad caused a computer to shut down the main engine of the Delta 2. Engineers investigating the aborted launch `` determined that its cause is most likely an electrical problem and -LRB- they -RRB- highly suspect ground equipment,'' said Capt. <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Warren </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. A team of engineers from the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> and the rocket's maker, <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Astronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Huntington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, was assembled after the scrubbed takeoff Wednesday night of the <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> 2 and its $ 65 milion payload, a Navstar Global Positioning Satellite. A source who requested anonymity said experts found nothing wrong with the rocket and are investigating the possibility that thunderstorms, which forced three previous launch postponements, may have caused a problem in the launch pad's circuitry. Officials said a valve stuck shut and starved the <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> 2's main engine of liquid oxygen, which mixes with a kerosene-type fuel to propel the rocket. A computer discovered the closed valve and shut the engine off before it could ignite. Launch controllers had sent an engine ignition command, but it never reached the fuel valve. An open electrical circuit apparently blocked the command, according to a source. The Navstar satellite will tell <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and allied military units their location within 50 feet _ on land, at sea, or in the air _ anywhere on the globe. Launch attempts on Saturday, Sunday and Tuesday were scrubbed.

 The worst violence at <ORGANIZATION> Folsom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prison </ORGANIZATION> in seven years left one inmate dead and five seriously injured. Prison officials said 25 to 30 inmates battled Thursday morning in an exercise yard occupied by about 300 prisoners. Several had weapons made within the prison. Spokeswoman Lt. <PERSON> Cammy </PERSON> <PERSON> Voss </PERSON> said three suffered gunshot wounds and two stab wounds. The guards fired 10 shots from their second-story posts to break up the brawl. A strip search of all prisoners in the yard revealed 43 men with minor wounds. But officers said some of those probably happened earlier and elsewhere but had n't yet been reported. The fight appeared to have been racially motivated, <PERSON> Voss </PERSON> said. Mostly black and Hispanic prisoners and a couple of white prisoners were involved. But it was apparently not gang-related, she said. `` We do n't know why it erupted,'' she added The slain inmate was identified as <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>, 29. He had arrived April 20 to begin a four-year term for armed robbery in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. He died of stab wounds 20 minutes after the fight began. Officers locked all of the maximum-security prison's 7,000 inmates into their cells after the fight broke out at the prison 20 miles east of <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION>. Facility B, where the melee occurred, is one of three in a wing that opened in October 1986, next to the 119-year-old stone walls. It houses about 1,000 prisoners considered to be among <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s most violent. <PERSON> Voss </PERSON> said it was the worst violence in the history of the new wing, and perhaps the worst at the entire <ORGANIZATION> Folsom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prison </ORGANIZATION> since seven years ago when racial violence, largely between Hispanic and black prison gang members, led to an extended lockup.

 A suspected drug dealer who let his fingers do the walking when he tried to collect a debt ended up in jail after accidentally dialing a police detective's pager. The detective returned the message and was told, `` You owe me $ 200 and if you do n't pay me back, I'll break your legs,'' Narcotics Sgt. <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> said Thursday. <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> said the man made it clear he was trying to collect on an unpaid drug debt. The suspect had tried to call an associate but missed by one digit, <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> said. The detective arranged to meet the man, but instead he was met by two undercover officers who bought his drugs and then arrested him on drug and firearm charges.

<HEAD>Dollar Down in Market Correction, Gold Up</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The dollar was down sharply in moderate European trading today, a trend analysts saw as an expected correction after a strong surge. Gold prices rose. Analysts said the dollar remained fundamentally strong, but that it needed to come down to about 1.9620 marks before another rise could be anticipated. The dollar traded at 1.9648 against the West German currency this morning. `` I think the market players feel they can relax a little now after the dollar's surprising rush earlier this week,'' said one trader in <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. Still, the dollar's growing strength raised a question for <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, which must decide whether to raise interest rates. `` It's a big dilemma for the central banks,'' said another Italian analyst. `` Higher interest rates will have a positive effect on exchange rates, but a negative effect on inflation.'' In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where trading ends before <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s business day begins, the dollar closed down sharply at 140.85 yen, dropping 1.95 yen from Thursday's close. During the <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> trading day, the dollar moved as low as 139.90 yen. Later, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the dollar drifted lower to 140.15 yen. Other dollar rates at midmorning compared with late Thursday: _ 1.9648 West German marks, down from 1.9965 _ 1.7225 Swiss francs, down from 1.7650 _ 6.6588 French francs, down from 6.7675 _ 2.2243 Dutch guilders, down from 2.2480 _ 1,242.00 Italian lire, down from 1,444.50 _ 1.2040 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2105 In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the British pound traded at $ 1.60 up from Gold opened in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> at a bid price of $ 365.75 a troy ounce, up from $ 364.75 late Thursday. At midmorning, the city's five major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $ 367.20. Earlier, in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, gold rose $ 1.55 an ounce to a closing bid of $ 366.41. Silver bullion in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> rose to a bid price of $ 5.34 a troy ounce, from $ 5.26 bid late Thursday.

<HEAD>Government To Hire New Doctors To Break Strike</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The government said it will hire 500 physicians to break an 11-day strike by doctors who took to the streets today singing `` We shall overcome.'' More than 3,500 doctors at <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>'s 11 government hospitals walked off their jobs in a wage dispute May 16, severely curtailing free and low-cost medical services for the capital's poorest people. Health Ministry spokesman D.N. <PERSON> Chaturvedi </PERSON> said on Thursday that government is authorizing administrators at all 11 hospitals to replace the strikers, temporarily or permanently. He said 500 doctors will be hired. Dr. <PERSON> Rohit </PERSON> <PERSON> Parasher </PERSON>, a strike leader, dismissed the government's latest move to end the strike He said the strike would continue indefinitely and the doctors were launching `` novel protests,'' including street plays and torchlight processions. The strikers staged a street play today outside <PERSON> Lok </PERSON> <PERSON> Nayak </PERSON> <PERSON> Jai </PERSON> <PERSON> Prakash </PERSON> <PERSON> Narain </PERSON> <PERSON> Hospital </PERSON>, parodying the government and the state-run television, Doordarshan. The doctors have accused Doordarshan of biased coverage of the strike. At the end of the play, a chorus sang `` We shall overcome'' in Hindi as striking doctors and supporters banged tin drums and clapped their hands. Since Monday, the strikers have been running outpatient clinics in tents outside nine hospitals. <PERSON> Parasher </PERSON> said the doctors were distributing free medicine as `` an expression of our deep anguish and concern for our patients.'' The government hospitals have remained open, staffed by 800 senior doctors, but most patients were discharged on the eve of the strike and few new ones have been admitted. The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION> doctors were joined in the strike by 1,400 others in <LOCATION> Chandigarh </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pondicherry </LOCATION>, Banaras and <LOCATION> Aligarh </LOCATION>. The walkout followed a deadlock in negotiations with the <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>. The striking doctors earned from $ 200 to $ 270 a month. They want a pay increase of $ 53 a month. They also want the government to increase their allowance for not maintaining private practice from $ 16 a month to $ 40. Doctors who work for the government are not allowed to have private practices to supplement their incomes.

 A man who killed a widow and stole her Christmas presents was executed in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>'s electric chair early today as inmates in nearby cells protested and one yelled, `` Murderers, murderers.'' <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Lindsey </PERSON>, 28, was pronounced dead by two doctors at 12:10 a.m. at Holman Prison near <LOCATION> Atmore </LOCATION>. The execution was the fourth in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> and the 111th in the nation since the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> allowed states to resume use of the death penalty in 1976. `` He had made peace with his maker,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, who was in the room adjacent to the death chamber and spent time with <PERSON> Lindsey </PERSON> earlier in the day. <PERSON> Lindsey </PERSON> was sentenced to death for the 1981 stabbing and shooting death of <PERSON> Rosemary </PERSON> <PERSON> Zimlich </PERSON> <PERSON> Rutland </PERSON>, 64, of Mobile, who was bound, gagged, stabbed and shot. Prosecutors said <PERSON> Lindsey </PERSON> killed her because she recognized him. Warden <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> asked <PERSON> Lindsey </PERSON> if he had any final words once he had been strapped into the chair, and the condemned man shook his head and closed his eyes. In nearby cells, inmates shouted in protest and one yelled, `` Murderers, murderers!'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hale </PERSON>, a prison system spokesman, said that earlier Thursday <PERSON> Lindsey </PERSON> visited with his sister, <PERSON> Cynthia </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>, and his brother, <PERSON> Tyrone </PERSON> <PERSON> Lindsey </PERSON>, for about three hours. Prison officials said the inmate also spent his final hours watching movies on a videocassette player in his cell adjacent to the electric chair. `` Throughout the afternoon, he seemed to be accepting his fate and was very reserved,'' <PERSON> Thigpen </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> refused Thursday to grant an emergency request for a stay of execution, and Gov. <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> turned down a request for clemency. Mrs. <PERSON> Rutland </PERSON> was killed Dec. 14, 1981, and Christmas presents were taken from her home. Police said <PERSON> Lindsey </PERSON>, who lived in a rental house directly behind Mrs. <PERSON> Rutland </PERSON>'s home, was captured at a shopping mall using the victims' credit cards. <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>'s last electrocution was Aug. 28, 1987, when <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Ritter </PERSON> was put to death for his role in the robbery and killing of a Mobile pawn shop owner.

Two-year-old <PERSON> Rachel </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON> died Wednesday night at <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> of a fractured skull and other broken bones, said Capt. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Campbell </PERSON>. Mrs. <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON>, 29, and her husband, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON>, 33, were also charged with endangering the welfare of the child, because two other children, ages 1 and 3, showed signs of abuse, police said. They were turned over to state welfare authorities. The couple also have three older children who live with relatives. A neighbor, <PERSON> Valencia </PERSON> <PERSON> Gil </PERSON>, told reporters that the mother had recently thrown a puppy and two kittens out of a window to punish the children.

<TEXT>
 Big-event programming for May and expiration of the effects of the 1988 scriptwriters strike helped the three networks at least slow the rate of audience erosion that has plagued them in recent seasons. The networks had a combined average audience share of 65 for the May sweep, 2 percent lower than May 1988, according to <ORGANIZATION> A.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nielsen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> ratings. Their combined rating was 37.8, compared with 38.7 in May 1988. The decline was less than the 3 percent rate of audience loss the networks suffered in the 1988-89 season compared with the 1987-88 season. That loss has been chalked up to the effects of the strike, which delayed the start of the season, and inroads by cable, videocassettes and independent channels. May is one of four `` sweeps'' months a year when local television ratings are measured for use in negotiating future advertising rates. The networks tend to load their schedules with special programming to help local affiliates. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, which just completed its fourth season win in a row, won the May sweep, too, with an average rating of 14.6. CBS had an 11.8. Even though <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> had the two top-rated shows in the sweep, the made-for-TV movie `` Everybody's Baby: The Rescue of <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON> <PERSON> McClure </PERSON>'' and the sitcom `` Roseanne,'' it came in third with an 11.4. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s two-parter, `` I Know My First Name Is <PERSON> Steven </PERSON>,'' was the highest-rated multipart movie of the sweep, with a 24.5 rating and 39 share. It was the highest-rated multiparter for <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> since `` Fatal Vision'' in November 1984, and the highest-rated multiparter on any network since `` Lonesome Dove'' on <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> in February. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s five-part conclusion of `` War and Remembrance'' was the second highest-rated multiparter of the sweep, though it had a so-so 14.9 rating. `` Everybody's Baby,'' based on the real-life 1987 rescue of a <LOCATION> Midland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, baby from an abandoned water well, had a 22.9 rating and 36 share to become the top-rated show of the sweep. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Roseanne'' beat out <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` The Cosby Show'' for second place, which <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> attributed to the effects of sunlight. `` Cosby'' had a lower rating, but higher share, because of its 8 p.m. EDT time period. Fewer people are in front of their sets in the early evening because it's still light outside. `` Roseanne'' has a 9 p.m. time period. And despite the performance of `` Roseanne,'' which was pre-empted at times during the sweep, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> lost Tuesday night to <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> won its 16th sweep in 17 sweeps. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> had broken its winning streak in February 1988 with the Winter Olympics. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> has become such a juggernaut, it is having a hard time finding new superlatives. <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaffe </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s vice president for research projects, said he was so impressed that <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> had won five nights a week during the May sweep, he had his staff check to see when a network last accomplished that feat. The answer: <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> _ in the last sweep in February.

 <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> has reinforced its 40,000 troops in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> with an armored tank brigade, and Syrian fighter planes flew over <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> positions today, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> media reported. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s Cabinet met in special session to discuss the troop moves, <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> said. An <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> official, who requested anonymity, confirmed a special Cabinet session was convened Thursday night but refused to give details. <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> officials said they were watching the situation closely but saw no reason to interfere as long as <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s northern border was not affected. `` As long as we do n't feel directly threatened, there is no way <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> is going to intervene,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Alon </PERSON> <PERSON> Liel </PERSON>. It was not immediately clear how the Syrian moves would affect the fighting in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. More than 350 people have been killed and nearly 1,400 wounded since Christian and Moslem forces began shelling each other's positions March 8 in the latest round of fighting in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s 14-year-old civil war. The Syrian reinforcements also came as the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> met in <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION> to discuss ways of enforcing a cease-fire it declared in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> on May 11. A spokesman for Christian forces in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> said two <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> warplanes flew over the <LOCATION> Chouf </LOCATION> mountains southeast of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> today and drew heavy anti-aircraft fire from Syrian-backed Druse militiamen. No hits were observed, he said. The media reports did not say how many additional Syrian troops were moved into eastern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, but the daily <ORGANIZATION> Yediot </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ahronot </ORGANIZATION> said they included 40 tanks. The troop movements were part of an exercise involving helicopter commandos backed by aircraft and tanks, the newspaper and radio reports said. The Syrian exercise was reportedly taking place in the <LOCATION> Bekaa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> near the Syrian border and not near the <LOCATION> Golan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heights </LOCATION>, which would be of major concern to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. But <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> radio reports in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> said Syrian aircraft were flying over <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> enclave. A spokesman for the Christian army commander, Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, said four Syrian jet fighters flew at high altitudes `` from the northern border to <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> for more than an hour beginning at 6:15 a.m.'' `` They veered off over <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and headed back north. They carried out the practice repeatedly,'' said the spokesman. He said Christian army units did not open fire at the jets. <PERSON> Motta </PERSON> <PERSON> Gur </PERSON>, a former army chief of staff, said on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio that the troop movements seemed more a political move aimed at <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> leaders attending the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> summit in <LOCATION> Casablanca </LOCATION> than a threat to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s security. `` We have to watch the situation closely, but in my assessment it's more an inner-Arab issue. The fact is that in <LOCATION> Casablanca </LOCATION> they got into difficulties,'' he said. The summit is trying to find a compromise to <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s refusal to end its fight with Christian armed forces. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> has rejected calls from <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> to withdraw its forces from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> to help end that nation's civil war. Syrian soldiers have been in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> since 1976 under an Arab League peacekeeping mandate. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> maintains a six-to-10-mile-wide security zone in southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Military sources who spoke on condition of anonymity said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> had not raised the alert status of its troops along the border. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s movement of anti-aircraft missiles into <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in 1981 touched off a crisis, and the two armies clashed during <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s invasion of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in 1982 Tensions also increased after <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> sent troops back into <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>.

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A judge today sentenced 14 black people to death in the 1985 killing of a black police officer who was beaten and set on fire by a mob. The defendants, singing an African hymn as they marched into court in the northwest city of <LOCATION> Upington </LOCATION>, were among 25 people convicted of murder in the slaying of police Constable <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> <PERSON> Sethwala </PERSON> in nearby <LOCATION> Paballelo </LOCATION> township. Under South African law, the death sentence is mandatory for people convicted of murder unless the judge determines there were mitigating circumstances. The 11 other defendants are to be sentenced next week, but the judge already has determined there were extenuating circumstances and the death penalty will not be imposed. Sentencing also is scheduled for a 26th defendant convicted of attempted murder. Most of the 13 men and one women sentenced to death today proclaimed their innocence during the hearing before <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Basson </PERSON>. `` I am an elderly woman and have been found guilty for something I have not done. ... Other people committed this crime,'' said <PERSON> Evelina </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Bruin </PERSON>, 60. Only one of the 25, Justice <PERSON> Bekebeke </PERSON>, was found to have committed the act that killed <PERSON> Sethwala </PERSON>, said defense lawyer <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Durbach </PERSON>. She said the sentences will be appealed. The group is the largest ever sentenced to death in a single crime in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, she said. <PERSON> Bekebeke </PERSON>, 24, did not maintain his innocence in his address to the court today but said the case was `` based on racial prejudice.'' Because the death sentence is mandatory, the defendants knew their sentences because the judge already had ruled on Thursday that there were no extenuating circumstances. Prosecutors said the 25 people were part of a crowd of 300 who pelted the victim's house with stones. At one point he fired a gun out the window, wounding a small boy, which defense lawyers said incited the crowd to assault the man and set him on fire. <PERSON> Basson </PERSON> noted that 3,000 people had gathered on a soccer field in the township the previous day to protest rent hikes and other actions by township authorities. He said the killing was politically motivated, part of a conspiracy to attack authorities. He rejected defense arguments that the individual defendants could not be held accountable for the actions of the crowd. One of those convicted was described by witnesses as a best friend of the victim. Defense lawyer <PERSON> Anton </PERSON> <PERSON> Lubowski </PERSON> said 10 defendants were sentenced to death but found to not have physically contributed to the officer's death. The 25 were convicted of murder in April 1988 under the principle of common purpose, which holds them responsible for the actions of a crowd if they were part of the group. The same principle was used against the <ORGANIZATION> Sharpeville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Six </ORGANIZATION>, a group of black men and women convicted of slaying a black town council member during the nationwide political unrest that gripped black townships from 1984-86. After an international campaign, President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> last year commuted the death sentences for the <LOCATION> Sharpeville </LOCATION> Six and replaced them with lengthy prison terms.

 A mother who abandoned her newborn daughter in a jetliner's restroom before a cross-country flight has pleaded no contest to felony child endangerment. <PERSON> Christine </PERSON> <PERSON> LoCasto </PERSON>, 27, of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, entered her plea Thursday after a prosecutor promised not to seek a prison term. Sentencing was set for Aug. 9. She originally pleaded innocent. The baby, <PERSON> Alyssa </PERSON>, was found under a restroom sink July 13 shortly after the jetliner landed in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> and the passengers departed. The child had apparently been born shortly before the plane took off from <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J </LOCATION>. The child, now 10 months old, is in the custody of her paternal grandparents in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> LoCasto </PERSON> was accompanied by her husband, <PERSON> Louis </PERSON>, when she entered the plea in <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mateo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. The couple have two other children. LoCasto, who was on the flight with his wife last July, was apparently unaware she was pregnant and did not know she had given birth in the restroom. Judge <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> gave no indication she will accept prosecutor <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Wagstaffe </PERSON>'s recommendation against prison. The felony charge carries a maximum penalty of six years in state prison, six years' probation and a $ 10,000 fine. The prosecutor noted that Mrs. <PERSON> LoCasto </PERSON> had no criminal record and that the baby was unharmed. And he said he still does not know why the mother abandoned the baby. Her attorney, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, said Mrs. <PERSON> LoCasto </PERSON>'s explanation was `` very complicated'' and that he did not want to invade her privacy by talking about it.

 About 300 radical students adopted tactics used by Chinese protesters and began a hunger protest today to demand the government admit that police killed a student leader. Students chanted anti-government slogans and songs at <ORGANIZATION> Myongdong </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cathedral </ORGANIZATION> to call for the fall of President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> <PERSON> Tae-woo </PERSON>'s government and demand police acknowlege they fatally tortured student leader <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Chol-gyu </PERSON> `` Overthrow the murder regime!'' and `` Down with <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> Tae-woo!'' protesters chanted. Riot police watched but made no move to intervene. About 100 students chanted slogans at the Roman Catholic cathedral's main gate. The other students rested in the compound or took part in discussion groups, taking water but no food. Students stayed out of the cathedral and administration buildings. Radical student leaders said they were using the same tactics as Chinese students fasting in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> to demand the introduction of democracy and other sweeping changes. Some students claimed they would fast to the death if their demands were not met. `` We are more determined than the students fasting in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>,'' a student leader told a news conference after the protesters moved into the cathedral compound overnight. In recent days, newspapers have pointed out the differences between the pro-democracy Chinese protesters and the anti-Western Korean students, who demand an ill-defined `` workers and farmers state.'' The newspapers have commended the Chinese for their peaceful tactics and urged Korean students to end violent protests. The editorials have urged Korean students to abandon their leftist views, saying the Chinese protesters are inspired by opposition to communism. `` It is regrettable that some students and intelluctals in our country are obsessed with socialism, an old ideology that communist nations are trying to reform,'' the moderate <ORGANIZATION> Jooang </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday. Radical students in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> lack popular support because of their extreme views and violent tactics. Some student groups have been trying to switch tactics after six riot troopers were killed May 3 in a clash in the southern city of <LOCATION> Pusan </LOCATION>. A seventh riot trooper injured in the May 3 clash died Thursday night, police said. The deaths outraged the public. Radical students and dissidents claim <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> was tortured and killed by police and are demanding the government acknowledge a cover-up. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>'s body was found May 10 in a reservoir near the southern city of <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION>. Police and government officials deny any official involvement in <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>'s death, although police tried to detain him at a roadblock just before he disappeared. The government says an autopsy proves <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> was not tortured, and officials speculate he slipped into the reservoir and drowned. The protesters in the cathedral compound today put up posters with color pictures of <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>'s bloated body. Crowds of up to 100,000 people marched in <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION> last week to demand the government admit police killed <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>. The demonstrations also called for <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>'s fall for the bloody suppression of a 1980 uprising in <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION>. Radicals claim the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was involved in <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION> and are demanding expulsion of the 43,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops based in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> under a defense treaty. Protests in <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> often include the burning of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> flags, which Culture and Information Minsiter <PERSON> Choe </PERSON> <PERSON> Byung-yul </PERSON> deplored today as `` an uncivilized act'' intended to damage <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>'s friendship with <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Also today, the government announced Foreign Minister <PERSON> Choi </PERSON> <PERSON> Ho-joong </PERSON> will lead a new government body of 10 vice ministers with authority to decide on U.S.-related issues involving American troops, anti-Americanism and trade. <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> has been seeking greater control over crimes involving American troops and other matters.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> shot down a package of measures that would have toughened handgun laws and imposed a limited ban on semiautomatic assault weapons. By a 2-1 margin, lawmakers Thursday defeated bills requiring handgun owners to register their weapons with state police, obtain identification cards, and notify authorities of change of address. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> fell two votes short of banning semiautomatic weapons using magazines or ammunition belts containing more than 10 rounds. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> recently enacted a similar ban. `` People are more concerned with the will of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rifle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> than they are of the desires of their own constituents,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Marovitz </PERSON>, one of two sponsors of the bills. Sen. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Barkhausen </PERSON> said the bill's proposal to register the guns would have cost $ 7.6 million and created a bureaucratic nightmare. Currently, people may own any type of firearm with a single firearm owner's identification card. The rejected measure would have required a separate card for handguns. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> did approve a measure sponsored by <PERSON> Marovitz </PERSON> that would allow revocation of a firearm owner's identification card if a judge determines that the owner presents a `` clear and present danger'' to himself or others.

 Consumer spending shot up 1.1 percent in April, the biggest advance in nearly a year, outpacing a 0.4 percent increase in personal income, the government reported today. The combination of a strong spending increase and the sluggish income gain produced a sharp reduction in the personal savings rate, which dropped to 5.3 percent last month from a three-year high of 6.3 percent during the previous month, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said. The April increase in personal income was the smallest gain since income fell 0.2 percent last November. Personal income had risen a strong 0.8 percent in March and 1.0 percent in February. Last month's increase in personal income, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $ 4.37 trillion, would have been stronger were it not for decreases in farm subsidies over the past two months, coupled with bonuses for autoworkers and retroactive Social Security benefit payments that inflated March's figure. Excluding those special factors, personal income advanced a strong 0.8 percent in April after rising 0.7 percent in March. The 1.1 percent increase in personal consumer expenditures, to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $ 3.42 trillion, was the biggest advance since a 1.3 percent increase was registered last June. Expenditures had risen just 0.3 percent in March and 0.4 percent in February, causing analysts to attribute part of the current slowdown in economic growth to slackening consumer spending. Consumer spending is closely watched as indicator of the economy's health because it accounts for two-thirds of overall economic activity. The rebound in spending last month was partly attributed to a rise in auto sales, which perked up somewhat in April after carmakers launched a round of rebates and cut-rate financing deals to lure customers back to showrooms. The pickup in auto sales was the primary power behind a 3.2 percent increase last month in consumer spending on durable goods _ `` big ticket'' items expected to last at least three years. Spending on durable goods last month rose to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $ 467.1 trillion after declining during the previous two months, when auto sales had been weak. Purchases of non-durable goods, meanwhile, rose 0.7 percent last month and spending on services rose 0.8 percent. Disposable, or after-tax income held virtually even last month after rising 0.3 percent in March. After-tax income was held down by a higher-than-usual April surge in federal income tax payments that was partly attributed to the after-effects of the 1986 tax overhaul. The increase in tax payments contributed to the decline in the personal savings rate, which represents savings as a percentage of after-tax income. Wages and salaries, a key component of personal income, rose 0.6 percent in April to a seasonally adjusted $ 2.61 trillion on an annual basis.

 A rainstorm aided firefighters battling a 10-day-old blaze in Everglades National Park today but lightning started several small fires in neighboring Big Cypress National Preserve, officials said. Firefighters said they hoped to declare the 85,000-acre <LOCATION> Everglades </LOCATION> blaze contained by sunset, with only isolated patches of smoke and fire remaining. `` Our fire is about 85 percent contained,'' said forest ranger <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Krumland </PERSON>, who expected the fire to be declared contained by 6 p.m. Thursday afternoon's rain `` did more good than bad for us,'' <PERSON> Krumland </PERSON> said. `` But bad lightning strikes did come down in <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cypress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Preserve </ORGANIZATION>, and they're working on that now.'' At <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cypress </ORGANIZATION>, which is west of the <LOCATION> Everglades </LOCATION>, spokesman <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said 20 firefighters worked through the night to contain a 300-acre fire that began earlier. In addition, he said, lightning began eight smaller fires Thursday, each covering only a few acres. The Everglades fire is centered about 30 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. Nearly 250 firefighters from around the country have fought the blaze since it was started by lightning May 16. The marshy sawgrass and isolated hardwood hammocks in the area had n't burned in more than 30 years, said park spokeswoman <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Tolle </PERSON>. Such fires before the rainy season normally cause only limited damage by burning off the top of the grass. `` We'll see,'' she said. `` As soon as the summer rains begin, there'll be a lush regrowth of the sawgrass.'' On Tuesday, the fire briefly threatened the Miccosukee Indian village at the park's northern edge. But then it shifted direction, and heavy smoke kept the park's neighboring <LOCATION> Shark </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> visitor center closed until Thursday morning. About 400 wildfires have scorched 350,000 acres of grass and brush in southern <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> since last October, according to state estimates.

 Prosecutors have dropped sex-abuse charges against a former day-care center operator who said she was elated but felt `` violated'' by more than two years of investigations and a trial. <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Fabiano </PERSON> had been charged with sexually abusing four preschool-age girls at her two day-care centers in suburban <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. The first trial, involving one of the girls, ended in acquittal March 30. <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Cagney </PERSON> and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Burke </PERSON>, assistant <LOCATION> Cook </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> state's attorneys, said the remaining charges were dropped Thursday to spare child witnesses from the trauma of a trial. `` I feel like a champagne bottle has just been opened,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Fabiano </PERSON>, 42. `` I am a free woman now, but I felt that I did n't have any rights throughout the whole thing,'' she said. `` I felt I was violated as was my family and my children.'' She accused prosecutors of mishandling the case and said she believes the charges were dropped because the state had no evidence in the remaining cases. But Ms. <PERSON> Cagney </PERSON> said the investigation was `` very thorough'' and `` sensitive to the rights of the family.'' `` She was not locked up,'' Ms. <PERSON> Cagney </PERSON> said. `` We were very aware of her rights and those of her family throughout the investigation.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Fabiano </PERSON>'s lawyers have filed a lawsuit asking that a judge overturn the state's decision to revoke her day-care license. And the parents of the four girls have sued Mrs. <PERSON> Fabiano </PERSON>. The investigation began in April 1987, when the mother of the child involved in the first trial said her 3-year-old daughter had said that `` Teacher <PERSON> Sandy </PERSON> did something to me.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Fabiano </PERSON> said she hoped dismissal of the charges would inspire new laws protecting teachers and others who work with children from unfounded charges of sexual abuse. `` I would never want to see anyone else go through this,'' she said.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said he ordered the expulsion of two <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomats to teach the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government to respect <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s sovereignty. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said he acted `` so that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> understands that there is a space that it must respect.'' The pair, he charged, were `` meddling in the country's internal affairs.'' <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> spoke Thursday to a group of coffee workers in <LOCATION> Matagalpa </LOCATION>, 85 miles northeast of the nation's capital. The Sandinsta government announced the expulsions Thursday, saying it believes the diplomats instigated wildcat teachers' strikes `` This shows the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> government is committed to disobeying the norms of civilized coexistence and is pledged to destabilizing governments, such as the one in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>,'' Foreign Minister <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Escoto </PERSON> said Thursday. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the charges were `` totally false and without any credible foundation.'' `` Clearly the government of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> is embarrassed by the fact that teachers in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> are on strike against conditions in that country,'' press officer <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Harter </PERSON> said. He suggested the action was to divert attention from the fact that the teachers' strike is being waged by a traditionally pro-Sandinista trade union. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said Thursday, `` We are conscious that -LRB- the teachers -RRB- are badly paid like ther rest of the workers.'' But he added, `` The aggressive <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy is responsible'' for <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s current economic crisis. He specifically blamed a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade embargo and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s support for right-wing Nicaraguan rebels known as the Contras Government spokesman <PERSON> Dionisio </PERSON> <PERSON> Marenco </PERSON> identified the diplomats ordered expelled as <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Williamson </PERSON> <PERSON> Barmon </PERSON>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attache for Central American labor affairs, and economic attache <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> Cassman </PERSON>. <PERSON> Cassman </PERSON> was given 72 hours to leave and Ms. <PERSON> Barmon </PERSON> 48 hours. She is based in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> but had been in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> for two days, <PERSON> Marenco </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Cassman </PERSON> arrived in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> last week with six other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials replacing seven American diplomats expelled last year. <PERSON> Marenco </PERSON> said the two `` went around distributing money and exhorting the teachers to strike.''

 Former Vice President <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON> said today he will not enter the 1990 race for a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> seat in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> and will not seek any other elective office in the future. `` I believe it's time for other candidates to step forward,'' said <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON>, a former senator who was the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s presidential nominee in 1984 `` It was a very difficult choice for us.'' <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON>, 61, said he has enjoyed his life out of political office and has seen too many colleagues remain in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> for too long. He was considering running against incumbent <PERSON> Rudy </PERSON> <PERSON> Boschwitz </PERSON>, a Republican. `` I'm at peace with myself,'' <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON> said. `` We took a lot of time making this decision and it's a basic one. It's a lot easier deciding when to get into politics as opposed to when to leave.'' A poll commissioned by <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON> indicated that the former vice president could defeat <PERSON> Boschwitz </PERSON> in the 1990 race. The poll, released by <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON>'s son, <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON>, shows <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON> leading <PERSON> Boschwitz </PERSON> 51 percent to 40 percent, with 8 percent undecided. `` <PERSON> Fritz </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON> clearly would have been the toughest competitor I could have had,'' <PERSON> Boschwitz </PERSON> told a news conference in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paul </LOCATION>. `` I certainly do have a sense of relief that he will not be the competitor.'' <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON>, a protege of the late <PERSON> Hubert </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON>, generally had been considered the most formidable candidate Democrats could field against <PERSON> Boschwitz </PERSON>, a two-term senator. <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON>'s announcement was expected to result in an immediate scramble among <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> Democrats for the 1990 <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> endorsement. The only announced challenger to <PERSON> Boschwitz </PERSON> is <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> member <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Wellstone </PERSON>, a political science professor at <ORGANIZATION> Carleton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> and a leader of the Rev. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s 1988 presidential campaign in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Boschwitz </PERSON>, 58, was elected to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in 1978. <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON> represented <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> from 1965 until 1976, when he left to be <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>'s vice president. He ran unsuccessfully for president against <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in 1984. Speculation that he planned to run again began in June 1987, when <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON> moved from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, back to <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> to practice law with a <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> firm. <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON> said today he was certain two years ago that he would `` not be tempted by yet another race for political office.'' But he said he considered running against <PERSON> Boschwitz </PERSON> because he loved public life and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and believed he would have a strong chance of winning. <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON> said he decided two days ago, after seeking advice from numerous friends and associates, to end his political career. He and his wife, <PERSON> Joan </PERSON>, spent more than 30 years in the `` political pressure cooker,'' <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON> said. `` For the first time in our lives, we have time to enjoy private life, to be with our family and friends and time to pursue our other interests that we could never do before,'' he said. `` I am finding that I can be heard on public matters while remaining in private life.'' <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON> said those from whom he sought counsel were nearly unanimous in urging him to run, but nearly all of them also said they would understand if he did n't.

 A summit of <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> leaders today dropped a demand that <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> withdraw its troops from <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> after encountering fierce opposition from the Syrians, conference officials said. Instead, the conference called for a revision of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s Constitution and left as a `` gentleman's agreement'' the withdrawal of Syrian soldiers from the capital, said <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> Foreign Minister <PERSON> Tariq </PERSON> <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON> The revised constitution would involve political reforms that could be considered the basis for national reconciliation in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, split by 14 years of civil war. Lebanese Moslems, now a majority in the country, claim the constitution reserves too much power for Christians, who were dominant when <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> gained independence from <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> in 1943. The withdrawal provision had been written into a resolution adopted early today, but it was deleted when leaders of the 22-member <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> met to draft the final communique from their four-day summit. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s President <PERSON> Hafez </PERSON> <PERSON> Assad </PERSON> argued bitterly over the <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> issue with President <PERSON> Saddam </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> is the main backer of the Christian forces and wanted a full Syrian withdrawal from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON> told reporters the resolution `` fell short of what must be done on this important issue. If it works, we shall be pleased, but if it does n't, we shall convene again here and deal with the whole matter more satisfactorily, and get a full mandate to take all the necessary measures.'' <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> has 40,000 troops in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> under an <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping mandate, and they have joined forces with Moslem militias fighting the mainly Christian troops of Army Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>. The summit entered its final hours amid news reports <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> had reinforced its troops in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Yediot </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ahronot </ORGANIZATION> said an additional 40 Syrian tanks were moved into <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, along with an undetermined number of troops. An early draft of the summit's resolution called for a committee, led by <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, to oversee the withdrawal of Syrian forces from <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> within three months. Last-minute Syrian stalling tactics forced the removal of that provision from the resolution, said conference sources speaking on condition they not be named. <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON> made it clear that <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> considered the withdrawal to be implicit and mandatory, and sources said the resolution still could be changed before this afternoon's closing plenary meeting. The earlier version also called for elections within three months to choose a government of `` national unity'' in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The revision called for the committee led by <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> to oversee revision of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s Constitution within six months. This would presumably include elections. The summit was extended a day as delegates sought agreement on <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, where Arab League-sponsored cease-fires have failed to stop fighting between Christians and the Syrian-backed Moslems. More than 350 people have been killed and nearly 1,400 wounded since Christian and Moslem forces began shelling each other's positions March 8 in the latest round of fighting The summit saw some spectacular reconciliations, particularly between <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>'s leader, <PERSON> Moammar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON>, and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s leader, <PERSON> Hosni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>, at his first Arab summit in 10 years. One session had to be delayed as <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> concluded a 3 -LCB- - hour reunion meeting The summit convened Tuesday to welcome <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> back to the Arab fold after a 10-year ostracism for making peace with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>.

Although he originally was scheduled to step down at the end of this month, <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> has agreed to remain in office until the party selects a new prime minister. Officials who spoke on condition of anonymity said <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> will meet party Secretary-General <PERSON> Shintaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Abe </PERSON> on Saturday to discuss possible choices. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> announced April 25 that he would leave office when the fiscal 1989 budget cleared parliament to take responsibility for a bribery scandal and consequent loss of confidence in his party. The budget bill becomes law Sunday, but no candidates have emerged to replace <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>. The Liberal Democrats' search for a new leader suffered a major setback May 13 when <PERSON> Masayoshi </PERSON> <PERSON> Ito </PERSON>, a reform-minded party veteran, refused to take the job. He cited his age of 75, failing health and a disagreement with party leaders over political reform measures. A new leader is needed to clean up the party's scandal-tainted image and salvage its plunging popularity before an election for half the seats in parliament's upper house, expected in June. The party is facing the worst crisis in its 34-year history because of a corruption and influence-peddling scandal named after Recruit. Co, an information and publishing congolemerate accused of selling politicians shares at low prices in exchange for favors. The scandal forced <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s resignation and led to indictment of a former <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> minister and senior bureaucrats. It also has damaged the political futures of dozens of senior politicians, including former Prime Minister <PERSON> Yasuhiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON>. News reports speculate that two of the most likely prospects to replace <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> are former Prime Minister <PERSON> Takeo </PERSON> <PERSON> Fukuda </PERSON>, 84, and former lower house Speaker <PERSON> Michita </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakata </PERSON>, 72.

<HEAD>Early Cholesterol Tests Can Help Predict Future Readings, Study Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Cholesterol tests in adults as young as 20 can be used to predict who is apt to have dangerously high cholesterol later in life, federal researchers said. Such tests could enable people to change their diet or begin exercise programs before serum cholesterol levels get too high, said a study issued Thursday by the Atlanta-based <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION>. High cholesterol is a major factor in heart disease. The researchers studied statistics on how cholesterol levels change over time, and developed a formula for predicting what cholesterol level a person with a given reading at a given age would have years later _ assuming they make no changes in their lifestyle. The data can be used to predict the serum cholesterol levels of adults age 20 to 57, the study found. For example, a 30-year-old woman with a cholesterol level of 155 can expect a level of 188 by age 50 and the borderline high level of 200 at age 56 if no exercise or diet improvements are made. A count of above 240 is considered high. Researchers found that a man's cholesterol count increases by about two points a year from ages 20 to 30 and one point a year from age 30 to 60, or an increase of 50 points over the 40 years, the report said. A woman's cholesterol level, on the other hand, normally increases by about 1 -LCB- points a year from age 20 to 40 and two points a year from age 40 to 60 or 70 points over the 40-year span.

 <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s hard-line leaders stripped <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON> of his post and placed him under house arrest in a purge of officials who supported demands for political reforms, sources said today. <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> lost power in a bitter fight with Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON>, Chinese and diplomatic sources said. <PERSON> Li </PERSON> last week ordered a crackdown on students occupying <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> to press demands for a freer society and cleaner government. Soldiers are deployed on the outskirts of <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, but tens of thousands of citizens have prevented them from entering the city by surrounding the convoys and setting up barricades. The soldiers have retreated to nearby barracks. The student occupation of <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> entered its 14th day today. An overnight rock concert by some students contributed to a festive atmosphere. According to sources, officials who have worked under <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> to chart political and economic reforms will face disciplinary action, and some will lose their jobs. Those reported in trouble include the party's propaganda chief, <PERSON> Hu </PERSON> <PERSON> Qili </PERSON>, and Vice Premier <PERSON> Tian </PERSON> <PERSON> Jiyun </PERSON>. The reports could not be officially confirmed. Although the number of students in <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> has dwindled to 20,000, leaders said those remaining were committed to continuing their occupation. `` It's going to get more complex. We can not ascertain what the leaders intentions are, but we will not leave the square,'' said a student leader from <ORGANIZATION> Qinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> who gave only his last name, <PERSON> Xin </PERSON>. <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> has been a leading proponent of market-oriented economic reforms championed by 84-year-old senior leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON>, but the two differ over political change. <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> has expressed sympathy with the student protesters, whose campaign evolved into a nationwide movement involving millions of people. President <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> <PERSON> Shangkun </PERSON>, a Deng ally, told top officials Thursday <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON>'s actions `` had a very bad effect'' on the nation, a government source said. Chinese and diplomatic sources said <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> was under house arrest. A document circulated today to county - and district-level party officials said <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> was no longer head of the party, according to a diplomat who has proved reliable in the past No successor was named in the document. Sources said conservatives accused <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> of heading an anti-party clique, splitting the party, instigating disturbances, revealing party secrets, corruption and taking credit for <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>'s achievements during the past decade of economic reform. Two sources said <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Wan </PERSON> <PERSON> Li </PERSON> was under detention in <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>, and one source said a member of the party's decision - making Politburo was also under house arrest Leaders of the tens of thousands of students still in <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> said they had not changed their resolution to stay, despite the latest reports. `` It's going to get more complex. We can not ascertain what the leaders' intentions are, but we will not leave the square,'' said a student from <ORGANIZATION> Qinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> who gave only his last name, <PERSON> Xin </PERSON>. The reports were not the first time top leaders were said to be in trouble during the power struggle, but the official media have indicated the conservatives are winning the battle for power. The official <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> newspaper reported today that all seven of the nation's military districts were backing <PERSON> Li </PERSON>'s martial law decree. State-run newspapers on Thursday prominently displayed a letter from military commanders supporting the crackdown. <PERSON> Li </PERSON> appeared on nationwide television Thursday for the first time in six days and defended martial law. <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> has not appeared in public since May 19, although a <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said Thursday that <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> retained his post. President <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> _ speaking to Politburo members, retired revolutionary leaders and <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> delegates of the national legislature _ said troops surrounding <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> eventually would assume control of the city's streets, the Chinese source said. The 81-year-old president said the army would not move immediately `` in order not to worsen the situation,'' according to the source. Two sources said <PERSON> Wan </PERSON> <PERSON> Li </PERSON> was under detention in <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> after being prevented from returning to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> on Thursday. The official Chinese press said he was staying in <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> for `` medical treatment.'' Wan rushed back to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> after cutting short a trip to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, where he praised the students as leading a patriotic movement. The fate of <PERSON> Hu </PERSON> <PERSON> Qili </PERSON>, one of five members on the <ORGANIZATION> Politburo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> _ the pinnacle of party power _ was less clear. He recently was reported to have backed <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON>. One source said <PERSON> Hu </PERSON>, who has been in charge of propaganda, was under house arrest. The other members of the standing committee are <PERSON> Li </PERSON>, <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON>, <PERSON> Yao </PERSON> <PERSON> Yilin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Qiao </PERSON> <PERSON> Shi </PERSON>. <PERSON> Yang </PERSON>, a former general, also indicated that <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> members who have participated in the demonstrations will be punished. Among the huge crowds protesting with the students have been party members from state-run media, research institutes, government ministries and factories. <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> newspapers reported today that a researcher for <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> who urged <PERSON> Li </PERSON> to resign had gone into hiding after escaping a kidnap attempt. The newspapers quoted <PERSON> Xu </PERSON> <PERSON> Haining </PERSON> as saying his apartment was ransacked Tuesday and he `` barely escaped the kidnap.''

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> began a four-nation European trip today, declaring the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> wants a `` stronger and more united <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'' as he headed to a <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> summit where an arms-control dispute threatens allied unity. With the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> embroiled in a major dispute about nuclear weapons policy, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> planned to use the summit as the stage for announcing a reduction of up to 10 percent in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troop strength in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, `` as many as 34,000 troops.'' White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> told reporters aboard Air Force One en route to <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>: `` Any ideas in this area would be one the president would want to discuss with the allies, he would raise with his partners at this session before he discusses anything publicly ... I am not confirming or denying any decisions.'' The chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, D-Ga., told <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> that a 10 percent reduction `` is the probable amount of reduction that would occur if the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> accepted the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> proposal on conventional arms control which is now tabled. A senior <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> official, asked by reporters in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> about the report, said `` our delegations here on the spot have not been apprised of this.'' He spoke on condition of anonymity. West German government spokesman <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmuelling </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>, `` We have no official word of such a decision.'' Some 250,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops are stationed in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. In his departure remarks, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> provided no hint of a significant <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> counter to recent Soviet arms proposals. He said, `` The importance of the alliance and its democratic underpinnings is the message I now take to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, upon arriving at the first stop of his trip in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> noted that, `` Since ancient times, the saying goes, `` All roads lead to <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>'' and it's still true. It is fitting that here I begin my first trip to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> as president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> praised U.S.-Italy ties of friendship and said `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> welcomes a stronger and more united <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.'' He said he plans to be `` actively engaged in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, promoting measures to encourage political and economic liberlization in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>.'' In his departure remarks at <ORGANIZATION> Andrews </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> outside <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the president said, `` <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> has been a success by any measure but success breeds its own challenges. Today, dramatic changes are taking place in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, East and West. For us, those changes bring new challenges and unparalleled opportunities.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> expressed hopes to see a <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> `` that is truly free, united and at peace'' and repeated his desire to move beyond the Cold War policy of containment `` to integrate the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> into the community of nations.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> added: `` We welcome the political and economic liberalization that has taken place so far in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and in some countries of <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. We watch hoping that more changes will follow.'' In <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>, the president planned a two-night stay and talks with Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> as well as with Italian leaders. <PERSON> Manfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Woerner </PERSON>, who is <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s chief executive, said failure to settle a dispute over nuclear weapons would be `` a rather unfortunate situation but it would not be a crisis or a catastrophe.'' Amid growing doubts in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> that a settlement was near, <PERSON> Woerner </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> he would like the allies to reach an agreement `` and avoid the impression of being split in an important matter.'' Setting the stage for the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> meeting, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will deliver a speech Sunday at an American cemetery in <LOCATION> Nettuno </LOCATION>, on <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s seacoast 39 miles south of the capital Later Sunday, the president will arrive in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> where leaders of the 16-nation alliance will begin two days of formal talks on Monday. From <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will go to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. The summit, called to mark <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s 40th anniversary and its success in keeping the peace in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, was thrown off track in advance by a dispute over short-range nuclear missiles in central <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The chief players in the argument are <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, which is demanding East-West negotiations soon to curb the missiles, and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, which oppose such talks as long as the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> maintains a major advantage in ground troops, tanks and other conventional weapons. The missiles, with a range of less than 300 miles, are largely deployed in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and would be used there in the case of war. The Bonn-Washington dispute is aggravated by a tide of disarmament sentiment in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, fanned by Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s promises to reduce conventional and nuclear forces. On the eve of his departure, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> received a message from West German Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>, the latest in a series of proposals and counterproposals. However, the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> said the two sides remained at an impasse. `` Our attitude from the beginning has been that we would like to reach an agreement on this before the summit, but if not, we'll discuss it there,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s press secretary, <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> `` If it's not resolved there, we'll discuss it in follow-on consultations.'' Emphasizing that the dispute will not shake the foundations of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, `` We do n't believe it will overwhelm or dominate the summit and it should not and will not be allowed to.'' In <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Woerner </PERSON> said, `` This alliance has lived with differences of opinion all through its very successful lifetime, and if this question is not solved today it will be solved tomorrow.'' The West German government also is resisting a joint U.S.-British effort to more than triple the range of Lance missiles to just below 300 miles. However, a decision on modernizing the weapons has been put off until 1992. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s trip, his first to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> as president, is seen as an important step as he tries to establish himself as a world statesman and attempts to counter <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s success in projecting himself as a peacemaker. `` It's nothing new that a new president faces a test from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Burton </PERSON> <PERSON> Pines </PERSON>, senior vice president and director of research at the <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>. `` The first test of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is not coming from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. It's <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> which is testing the new president.''

 Maverick <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> and several prominent reformers in the new congress were nominated today for a smaller, full-time legislature, but some charged that senior officials rigged the nominee list to stay in power. <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION> threatened to boycott the elections to the new legislature if delegates from other republics are allowed to vote on the Lithuanian slate. The Lithuanians and other Baltic reformers want to protect their small reform slates from being lost in an all-congress vote. President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> called the boycott threat `` a crisis situation.'' The moves came during the second day of debate in the 2,250-member <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION>, the first competitively elected national assembly and the latest step in the Soviet experiment with democratic reform. Only one member of the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Politburo </ORGANIZATION> appeared on a congressional list of nominees for the smaller law-making body, the Supreme Soviet, assuring an overhaul of its traditional makeup. Procedural bickering today mirrored the disputes that slowed the first day of activity in the congress, which was elected this spring in the first nationwide multicandidate balloting in 70 years. A list of 573 members of congress selected by their home regions was prepared for 542 seats in the Supreme Soviet, giving deputies few choices but setting up tough races for lawmakers from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, home to many of the reformers. `` The party apparatus is once again asking us to elect the Supreme Soviet according to the old system,'' complained deputy <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevlyuga </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Rostov </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Zolotukhin </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tashkent </LOCATION> said top party and government officials in <LOCATION> Uzbekistan </LOCATION> had themselves nominated without consulting other deputies from the republic. Reformers lost an attempt to force top party officials to choose between their party jobs and serving in the Supreme Soviet, as a way of easing the grip of the party bureaucracy on the country's legislature The congress adopted a measure calling for Supreme Soviet members `` as a rule'' to be freed from other jobs to concentrate on lawmaking _ far short of the outright ban sought by delegates. Meanwhile, the <LOCATION> Lithuanian </LOCATION> delegation announced through deputy <PERSON> Vytautas </PERSON> <PERSON> Landsbergis </PERSON> it would boycott planned elections to the Supreme Soviet if deputies from other republics are allowed to vote on the Lithuanian slate. The congress is trying to decide whether only republics and specific regions should be allowed to select their members in the Supreme Soviet, or whether lists of candidates from each area should be presented to the entire congress to be narrowed down. The Lithuanians, who have been pressing for more autonomy from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, are seeking to have their slate elected intact to the congress, without delegates from other regions tampering with it. The boycott threat drew criticism from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> delegates, causing a rift between two leading groups of reformers. <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> historian, appealed to the Lithuanians to reconsider. `` I ask the comrades from <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION> ... not to break the huge amount of work done in our society to democratize it,'' he said. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> deputies, who are generally better known nationally, insisted on presenting a slate of 55 candidates for the 29 seats allocated to them to underline the principle of contested elections. On Thursday, the congress elected <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to a five-year term. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> ran unopposed. He was first elected president by the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> on Oct. 1, 1988, replacing <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> Gromyko </PERSON> in what was then a largely a ceremonial post. <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> refused to run against <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> but kept alive the possibility he would run for vice president. He told reporters he did not intend to withdraw from any more races. Some members of the congress plunged into debate over procedural issues, while many others appeared bored by the slow pace of the televised session. <PERSON> Fedor </PERSON> <PERSON> Burlatsky </PERSON>, a political commentator and head of the government's human rights commission, said the congress was trying to work out `` not only differences of opinion but differing interests, of different nationalities and different layers of society.'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> rejected calls to place microphones throughout the huge hall to permit speakers to have the floor without walking to the well in the center of the auditorium. `` Let's not turn this into a bazaar,'' he said. While <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>'s name appeared on the list of candidates for the Supreme Soviet, his election was not assured. He was among 12 deputies nominated by a caucus of the Russian federation, the country's largest constituent republic, for their 11 seats. It was also possible nominations would come from the floor. <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON>, once a rising star among <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s key aides, was fired for criticizing the slow pace of reform, then staged a dramatic comeback by winning a landslide victory to the congress. Among the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> nominees were some of the nation's best-known progressives, including <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON>, economist <PERSON> Gavril </PERSON> <PERSON> Popov </PERSON> and agriculture reform advocate <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Chernichenko </PERSON>. <PERSON> Vitaly </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vorotnikov </PERSON>, chairman of the Russian federation's <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministers </ORGANIZATION>, was the only member of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s ruling Politburo on the list, indicating the Supreme Soviet will be led by a new group of In the past, the body paralleled the leadership of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, making it a virtual rubber-stamp for the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> leadership.

 <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON>, the man who represents <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s new, progressive leadership, apparently has been purged by an old guard intent on retaining its lock on power and crushing a student movement for democracy. Several sources said today that <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON>, 69, had lost his post as general secretary of the 47 million-member <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. That position had made him the most powerful man in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> after senior leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON>. The sources said <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> has lost a power struggle with the more conservative Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON>. They said he was under house arrest today and that the party had accused him of fueling student unrest with a conciliatory stance. Although <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> is <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON>'s mentor in economic reforms, the two differ sharply on political reform and <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON>'s sympathy for the students apparently was unacceptable. If <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON>'s fall is permanent, he would be the second general secretary in two years to fall from <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>'s good graces and be sacked for being too sympathetic to pro-democracy student demonstrators. In January 1987, <PERSON> Hu </PERSON> <PERSON> Yaobang </PERSON> was forced to resign as general secretary after being accused of being soft on students seeking a freer <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. It was <PERSON> Hu </PERSON>'s death on April 15 that sparked the far larger student movement of today. <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> ended a seven-year term as premier when he was named head of the party in November 1987. At the same time he was appointed first vice chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> _ <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> is chairman _ giving him the needed authority with the military to cement his claim as <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>'s successor. But <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> became the target of criticism in mid-1988 when the government, hit by an inflation rate of more than 30 percent and panic buying, began worrying that it had lost control of the economy. Conservatives such as Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> blamed the rapid pace of market-oriented reforms associated with <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON>, and imposed a two-year austerity program and freeze on new reforms. <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON>'s position became more tenuous this spring with the renewed student unrest. While tens of thousands of students occupied <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> earlier this month, <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> told Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> that political and economic reform should proceed at an equal pace and that Chinese should enjoy `` genuine democracy'' under the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. He later expressed sympathy for the student demands for democratic reforms and advocated negotiations with the protesters to end the crisis. <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> has permitted only token political liberalization, and he reportedly gave the orders for declaring martial law in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> has been a role model for the new-style <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> leader. Suave and articulate, he is at ease with the leaders of the socialist and Western worlds. He wears immaculately tailored Western suits, and regularly plays golf, a sport once condemned in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> as a bourgeois luxury. <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> was born in October 1919 to a landowning family in central <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Henan </LOCATION> province. He joined the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in 1938 and headed the party committee in his native county for most of the 1937-45 China-Japan war. Unlike the previous generation of party leaders, he did not take part in the 1934-35 Long March, the 7,700-mile trek to the northwest to escape the Nationalist government troops in eastern <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. After the Communist victory in 1949, <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> spent most of his career in regional government and party posts. He was purged during the 1966-76 far-leftist Cultural Revolution, as was <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>, but was rehabilitated as early as 1971. He gained national prominence as party secretary and governor of <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>'s home province, <LOCATION> Sichuan </LOCATION>, where he carried out <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>'s policies of dismantling communes and allowing private plots and bonuses for extra work. <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> was named party secretary in October at a conference in which his keynote speech emphasized increasing production over ideological issues. He also announced <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>'s theory that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> was in a `` primary stage'' of socialism, during which time private ownership of businesses was permissible.

<HEAD>Ultralight Pilots Say They Spirited Friend From East Germany</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Two ultralight planes landed in front of the Reichstag building in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> early today, and two men reportedly claimed they flew a friend to freedom in a daring escape from <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, Police said they were mystified by the landings and had no independent confirmation of the reported escape. The planes were abandoned after landing in front of the Reichstag building, next to the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall, at about 5 a.m., police said. The pilots were not seen, and police later towed the aircraft away. Police first said they doubted the planes were used for an escape but later said they were not ruling out such a possibility. An anonymous caller telephoned several radio stations to claim he flew his relatives out of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Rainer </PERSON> <PERSON> Hildebrandt </PERSON>, head of a private organizaton that monitors escapes from <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, said two men came to his office and claimed they were the pilots. He said the two men told him they flew into <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, picked up a friend and flew back to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hildebrandt </PERSON> said he could not confirm the claim. It was not immediately clear why the men would have needed to planes to pick up their friend. The men told <PERSON> Hildebrandt </PERSON> they had recorded the flight on film and wanted to sell it, <PERSON> Hildebrandt </PERSON> said. They refused to appear before reporters, <PERSON> Hildebrandt </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. He said the men were between 30 and 40 years of age but did not identify themselves. They said they were former East German citizens who have been living in the West, he said. <PERSON> Hildebrandt </PERSON> heads Working Group August 13, a private organization that monitors escapes and human rights in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Witnesses reported the propeller-driven aircraft flew parallel to the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> at an alititude of about 165 feet, police said. Police said the olive-green planes were marked with red stars pasted onto the wings with yellow tape. This could have been a ruse designed to fool East German border guards, police said. Police said the abandoned ultralights appeared to be the same as two aircraft transported to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> four weeks ago. The planes were transported in parts and authorities had given permission for the aircraft to be assembled but not flown, police said.

 Police today stopped a 41-year-old man from hijacking a Czechoslovak passenger plane as it flew from <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> to the nearby town of <LOCATION> Karlovy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vary </LOCATION>, the official <ORGANIZATION> CTK </ORGANIZATION> news agency.

Six broadcast journalists said the ban on interviews with groups such as the <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Ulster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Freedom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fighters </ORGANIZATION> was unlawful, an unjustifiable interference with freedom of expression, and a violation of the European Convention on Human Rights. But three High Court judges ruled that Home Secretary <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurd </PERSON> acted reasonably and lawfully, and with the majority approval of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, in imposing the ban in October. <PERSON> Hurd </PERSON>'s order prohibits the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION>, which oversees commercial TV, from broadcasting words spoken by <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> extremists. The extremists' actions, objectives and views can be reported. The rule applies to the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> and its legal political wing <ORGANIZATION> Sinn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fein </ORGANIZATION>, which are fighting to end British rule in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, as well as the <ORGANIZATION> Ulster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Freedom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fighters </ORGANIZATION>, an outlawed <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> extremist group that wants the province to remain British. Lord Justice <PERSON> Tasker </PERSON> <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON>, announcing the decision, said the ban did not prevent either the <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION> or commercial television from reporting events in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> `` with due impartiality.'' He said the reasonableness of <PERSON> Hurd </PERSON>'s ban was reflected in the parliamentary debates in which many lawmakers said the restrictions were justified by the need to fight terrorism in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON> <PERSON> Ecclestone </PERSON>, deputy general secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journalists </ORGANIZATION>, said an appeal was likely all the way to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lords </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s highest court. Broadcaster <PERSON> Scarlett </PERSON> <PERSON> MccGwire </PERSON>, one of the plaintiffs, called the ruling `` a blow to the British public.'' `` The case is not just about journalists not being able to report <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> properly. It is about people not being able to understand what is happening there because it is not reported properly,'' she said. The plaintiffs claimed the restrictions were unjustified, especially since the amount of broadcasting time given in the past to interviews with members of proscribed organizations had been `` trifling'' and had not shown those interviewed in a good light. <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> said the question for the court was not whether <PERSON> Hurd </PERSON>'s decision was politically wise or unwise but simply whether it was lawful

 Battle lines have been drawn in the perjury trial of former Rep. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON>, with prosecutors saying he negotiated to borrow drug money and lied about it and <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON>'s lawyers saying he was duped. <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> is accused of lying to a federal grand jury about his dealings with an <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> undercover agent, <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Mullaney </PERSON>, and a <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> associate, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> LeChasney </PERSON>, later convicted of money laundering. Prosecutors say <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> negotiated to use LeChasney as a middleman in an attempt to borrow $ 850,000 for construction of his luxury home from a money broker representing drug interests _ actually the undercover agent. <PERSON> Mullaney </PERSON>, the first witness for the prosecution, testified today that at his first meeting with <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> in August 1987, the congressman `` brought up the possibility'' of having LeChasney create `` some sort of corporation ... and he would basically get his money from <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> LeChasney </PERSON>'s company.'' Prosecutors played a videotape for the jury of that meeting, but jurors complained they could n't hear the soundtrack properly. A recess was called while court officials worked on the problem. On Thursday, when he began his testimony, <PERSON> Mullaney </PERSON> had said that <PERSON> LeChasney </PERSON> told him that <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> `` did n't care where the money came from.'' He said he also was interested in meeting <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> to investigate whether <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON>'s plans to sell a $ 1 million note at a discount for cash `` would lead to an evasion of his income taxes'' and violations of currency laws. In opening statements Thursday, <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Hendrix </PERSON>, told the jury that <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> and the government were duped by `` <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> LeChasney </PERSON>, the master manipulator.'' <PERSON> Hendrix </PERSON> described <PERSON> LeChasney </PERSON> as `` a man with a severe mental disorder ... a sociopath,'' and said <PERSON> LeChasney </PERSON> repeatedly fooled <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> into thinking the money was legitimate, and fooled the government into thinking that <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> was a tax-evading `` crook.'' <PERSON> Hendrix </PERSON> told the jury that <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> never agreed to the deal and that he continued to shop for and ultimately got other financing for his home. After <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> did his best to recall for the grand jury in February 1988 events of five months earlier, <PERSON> Hendrix </PERSON> said, the former congressman was indicted anyway by a government `` predisposed to believe he's a crook.'' <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> was indicted Oct. 17 on 10 counts of lying to a federal grand jury, each of which carries a penalty of 10 months to five years in prison. The two-term <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> congressman lost his 4th District seat in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>'s eastern suburbs to Democrat <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, a onetime actor in television's `` Dukes of Hazzard,'' in November. The campaign was one of the most bitter <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> races in the country and one of only a handful that ended up in the defeat of an incumbent congressman. Briefs unsealed Thursday showed prosecutors have sought to introduce tapes of <PERSON> LeChasney </PERSON> telling the undercover agent that <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> did n't want to know details about the money scheme because the congressman said he wanted to be sure he could pass a lie-detector test if necessary. The prosecutors said the tapes would show <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> planned to lie to the grand jury. But defense attorneys contended that if the tapes were admitted as evidence, they should be allowed to submit evidence that <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> passed a lie detector test in which he was asked if he had lied to the grand jury. Such evidence previously has been ruled inadmissible in most cases.

 The five teen-agers charged with sexually assaulting a mentally retarded girl with a toy baseball bat and a broom handle have been suspended from school for 10 days. `` They were not suspended because of the alleged acts, but because of the disruption their presence in the school would have on the educational program,'' said <PERSON> Glen </PERSON> <PERSON> Ridge </PERSON> Superintendent of Schools Rose <PERSON> McCaffrey </PERSON>. The five <ORGANIZATION> Glen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ridge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> students were arrested Wednesday and charged with sexually assaulting the girl at the home of two of the boys, co-captains of the football team, in this <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION> suburb. Eight other male teens, including the son of a <LOCATION> Glen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ridge </LOCATION> police lieutenant, cheered the attack on the 17-year-old girl without intervening, investigators said. The eight are considered witnesses and have not been charged. At the school's annual `` spring day'' Thursday, the picnics and games were marred by fights, vandalism and the discovery of graffiti on walls inside the school building, students said. One student shook his head as he removed a rock and shards of glass from the back seat of his car. Some passers-by in cars shouted `` rapists'' as they drove past the school. <PERSON> Damian </PERSON> <PERSON> DeVito </PERSON>, a 17-year-old junior, defended the accused teens, two of whom are his football teammates. He said has known the victim since elementary school and said he believed she willingly participated in the March 1 incident. `` I know them well enough to know they would n't do anything against somebody's will,'' <PERSON> DeVito </PERSON> told reporters. `` These kids are really not bad kids at all.'' <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Greiner </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Retarded </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citizens-New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jersey </ORGANIZATION>, called the attack demeaning. `` I suppose that she was treated like an object ... a dehumanizing affair at best, with spectators cheering on,'' <PERSON> Greiner </PERSON> said. `` It's difficult enough to live your life with a handicap. It's especially difficult to be treated in a dehumanizing way.'' A 17-year-old football teammate of some of those charged says he was asked to videotape them having sex with the victim the day after the assault, the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported today. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Figueroa </PERSON> said he refused to make the tape and eventually informed authorities about the attack, the newspaper said. There was no answer this morning at a telephone listing for <PERSON> Figueroa </PERSON>. <PERSON> Figueroa </PERSON>'s comments are suspect because he `` likes to fantasize,'' <PERSON> McCaffrey </PERSON> said. She said the student undergoes counseling in a school resource room.

 Teachers returned to classrooms today with higher salaries and more authority in the schools after approving a three-year contract to end a bitter strike in the 594,000-pupil district. Teachers, students and administrators expressed joy and relief today at the return to regular classes. `` I feel just fine because everything is back to normal now,'' said smiling 10th-grader <PERSON> Brenda </PERSON> <PERSON> Montoya </PERSON> as she headed to class at Belmont High. `` We have our teachers back and now we can get back to our studies.'' Principal <PERSON> Marta </PERSON> <PERSON> Lavat </PERSON> <PERSON> Vin </PERSON> told students gathered for an assembly that it was time for them to get back to their studies. `` I said I did n't want to see anyone leaving school without their books today, I told them if they were heading out of the building and did n't have their books, they'd better have a good excuse.'' The teachers approved a pact Thursday that increases pay by 24 percent over three years, gives them greater curricula control, and reduces outside classroom duties such as yard supervision. `` Things in the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unified </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION>, as far as teachers are concerned, have changed for all time,'' proclaimed <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Teachers-Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> before the agremeement was approved by the union's members in a voice vote at the Sports Arena. Teachers lost on the issue of recovering pay that had been docked because of job actions that preceded their May 15 walkout. Many teachers had refused to patrol school yards or work on grading after school. Board members also approved the pact, reached by negotiators at 1 a.m. Thursday. `` I look forward to healing, not only on the board but in the district as a whole,'' said board President <PERSON> Roberta </PERSON> <PERSON> Weintraub </PERSON>. One board member, <PERSON> Rita </PERSON> <PERSON> Walters </PERSON>, criticized the $ 600 million salary plan as a drain on other parts of the budget. `` There is money being taken away from the children by the district, from other workers in our district in order to support the teacher raise. I think that's unconscionable,'' she said. The teachers carved out a site-management program under which they share power with parents and administrators in overseeing curriculum and discipline. The union represents 22,000 of the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> Unified School District's 32,000 teachers, counselors and librarians. Salaries under a contract that expired in July 1988 range between $ 23,440 and $ 43,319 a year, depending on experience and education. The pact raises salaries in the first year to between $ 25,316 and $ 46,594 and at the end of three years to between $ 29,529 and $ 53,938. Teachers will receive a retroactive pay raise for the past school year, during which they worked without a contract. The district, the second largest in the nation after <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, brought in substitutes when teachers walked out. But attendance plummeted and classes became mostly baby-sitting sessions.

 Soldiers and police officers today searched the offices of several leftist unions, human rights groups and farming cooperatives after the heaviest combat in the capital in years. The U.S.-backed government and armed forces consider the leftist organizations fronts for Marxist-led guerrillas waging a 9-year-old revolutionary war. Troops from the 1st army brigade, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> surrounded the headquarters of the labor organizations <ORGANIZATION> UNTS </ORGANIZATION>, Fenastras and FUS. The offices of <LOCATION> COACES </LOCATION>, a group representing cooperative farming enterprises, <LOCATION> CRIPDES </LOCATION>, a refugees organization, and the non-governmental human rights commission also were surrounded and searched. Troops and police had searched at least three of the organizations by mid-morning, but there was no immediate word on whether arrests were made or what was found inside. The <ORGANIZATION> UNTS </ORGANIZATION> labor organization reported in paid radio announcements that two members of its directorate were arrested. Security forces prevented journalists and other interested parties from approaching the buildings. No one was allowed to enter or leave the buildings. The searches came several hours after leftist guerrillas attacked parts of the capital a week before a rightist party takes power. Authorities said six guerrillas were killed Thursday night. Five members of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION>, one army soldier and three civilians were wounded, officials said. Col. <PERSON> Orlando </PERSON> <PERSON> Zepeda </PERSON>, commander of the capital-based 1st army brigade, told journalists the leftist groups harbored guerrillas who took part in an attack on his brigade Thursday evening. Combat raged through much of northern <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, near the brigade headquarters and three other police and military posts. Rebels of the <ORGANIZATION> Faribundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Frontr </ORGANIZATION> dubbed the offensive `` All Against Arena. We're going to win.'' Arena is the Spanish acronym of for <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>, the rightist party that is to take power June 1. The guerrillas have pledged `` to make the country ungovernable'' by stepping up attacks in the days leading up to the inauguration of President-elect <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON>, who is to take office from centrist <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON> <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>, a Christian Democrat. Col. <PERSON> Zepeda </PERSON> said about 30 insurgents took part in the attack Thursday evening, including four men aboard a jeep who fired U.S.-made M-79 grenades and Soviet-made RPG-18 rocket-propelled grenades at the brigade headquarters. At least six projectiles landed inside the base perimeter and caused property damage but no casualties, <PERSON> Zepeda </PERSON> said. `` We knew the level of violence had to increase. We're ready to repel anything they try to do,'' he told reporters at brigade headquarters. Thursday's fighting began about 6 p.m. and lasted about 80 minutes. About 7,000 Marxist-led guerrillas have been waging trying to topple the government. The war has killed about 70,000 people, most of them civilians.

 A third of the children in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s southern commercial center, <LOCATION> Ho </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Minh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, ca n't afford to go to school, the <ORGANIZATION> Vietnam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> reported Friday City resources are being severely strained by `` an alarming population explosion'' of 70,000 more mouths to feed each year, the official agency said. `` Every year, about 150,000 adults reaching the working age can not find a job. This does not include 29,000 people who stay at home as housewives,'' it said. `` Thirty-seven percent of the children at school age can not afford schooling and this is one of the many reasons for the rise in the crime rate.'' The city of 5 million people hoped to lower the annual population growth rate to one percent by 1990, the report said. `` This is no easy target because the feudalist tendency to view happiness as synonymous with having many children still prevails among large sections, especially peasants,'' it said. Under the city's family planning program, couples who have no more than two children get preferential treatment in housing, wages, and tourist trips, the report said.

 The apparent demise of <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON> has proven again that heirs to power in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> often end up on the fast track to oblivion. As head of the 47 million-member ruling party, <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> was in line to succeed <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON> as <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s untitled but undisputed leader. Many had predicted that <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>, 84, would retire by the end of the year. Sources now say <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> has been stripped of his post after crossing with <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> over the handling of the pro-democracy student uprising. <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> was sympathetic with its goals and sought compromise; <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> demanded a crackdown and declared martial law in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> is hardly the first to be raised up, only to be slapped down by an autocratic ruler. The most recent was <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON>'s predecessor, <PERSON> Hu </PERSON> <PERSON> Yaobang </PERSON>, who was forced to resign in similar circumstances in January 1987. Hu also was <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>'s unofficially designated successor until student demonstrations in December 1986 kindled a battle between party hardliners and moderates. <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>, an economic reformer with conservative views on political reform, moved to stamp out `` bourgeois liberalization,'' or favoring Western ideas. <PERSON> Hu </PERSON> was ousted for being too soft on the students, and it was his death April 15 that triggered the recent, bigger unrest. The most tragic case of a deposed No. 2 was that of <PERSON> Liu </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaoqi </PERSON>, one of <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> <PERSON> Tse-tung </PERSON>'s earliest supporters. By the 1950s he was <PERSON> Mao </PERSON>'s second-in-command, and in 1959 became head of state. But <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> turned on <PERSON> Liu </PERSON> during the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution, branding him a traitor. <PERSON> Liu </PERSON> and his wife were personally humiliated in Red Guard struggles, and he is believed to have died in prison in 1969. <PERSON> Liu </PERSON>'s downfall in the Cultural Revolution was paralleled by the rise of Defense Minister <PERSON> Lin </PERSON> <PERSON> Biao </PERSON>. A party congress in 1969 formally named <PERSON> Lin </PERSON> vice chairman and designated him as <PERSON> Mao </PERSON>'s successor But <PERSON> Lin </PERSON> plotted to assassinate <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> in 1971 so he could seize power before rivals could mount a challenge to his position.

In 1976, backed by <PERSON> Mao </PERSON>'s reported deathbed comment `` with you in charge, I'm at ease,'' <PERSON> Hua </PERSON> arrested the leftist `` Gang of Four'' led by <PERSON> Mao </PERSON>'s wife and assumed leadership of the party and government. But <PERSON> Hua </PERSON>, who spent most of his career in the provinces, was no match for <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>, who was purged during the Cultural Revolution but came back after the decade of chaos to steadily gain supporters for his new pragmatic policies. By 1978, <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> was in charge and <PERSON> Hua </PERSON> was heading to the sidelines. Today he is a little-seen and much-ignored party cadre.

<HEAD>Seabrook Nuclear Power Plant Gets Low-Power License</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: INSERTS 2 grafs after 4th graf, `The commission ...' with signs
posted in plant building, no protesters outside plant this morning.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FRANK BAKER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SEABROOK, N.H. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A low-power atomic testing license was approved today for the <LOCATION> Seabrook </LOCATION> nuclear power plant, which has been a focus of the anti-nuclear movement since the project was conceived two decades ago. `` The people here feel it's really about time,'' an elated <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, president of <LOCATION> Seabrook </LOCATION> operator <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yankee </ORGANIZATION>, told reporters Thursday after a favorable court ruling in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> late in the day. That court action cleared the way for the <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> to formally issue the low-power license. <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Ingram </PERSON> said the commission staff granted the license shortly after 9 a.m. today. The commission approved the move a week ago but delayed the paperwork to allow for appeals. Signs were posted in the <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON> administration building celebrating the decision. One read, `` License Received! A time for pride. A time for power.'' Although the plant has been the site of numerous protests over the years, there were no demonstrators outside the facility this morning. <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON>'s first chain reaction could start within two weeks. Plant officials said today they expected to start preparations for the tests this weekend. A low-power license allows a reactor to operate at 5 percent capacity. Most of the plant's 1,400 workers had already gone home by the time the court ruled, <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Sher </PERSON> said, `` but for those people seen here there were certainly a lot of smiles and congratulations.'' `` There's certainly a sense of relief, and also a sense of satisfaction that all of the work that we've done for so long to get us to this point will allow us to do what we've been ready to do _ and that is prepare the plant for the generation of electricity,'' <PERSON> Sher </PERSON> said. Ten years behind schedule and 10 times over budget, the $ 6 billion plant has been a focus of the nation's anti-nuclear movement. Located on marshland less than two miles from the state's most popular beach, near Interstate 95 and only 40 miles from <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON> was the target of mass protests including one that resulted in 1,414 arrests in 1977. Sixteen months ago, lead plant owner <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION> was forced by its <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON> debt to seek bankruptcy reorganization. Finished nearly three years ago, <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON> has remained idle principally because of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' refusal to cooperate in emergency planning. Based on a study triggered by the Soviet nuclear disaster at <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION> in April 1986, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> declared that safe evacuation of people around <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON> could not be assured. The <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> since has accepted, pending a detailed study in progress, emergency plans submitted by <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON>'s owners, 12 utilities serving much of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON> foes promise to continue fighting and insist that that their chances are better when the issue becomes commercial operation. `` We're not out of this by a long shot,'' said <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Attorney General <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON>, probably the key player in the anti-Seabrook fight. <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON>'s <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> insisted that safety concerns will not prevent commercial operation. `` I said it before and I'll say it again today: <LOCATION> Seabrook </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Station </LOCATION> is the safest power plant that's ever been built,'' he said. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> spoke at a news conference less than an hour after the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> turned down a last-ditch appeal by <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON> and others to block the tests. They argued that tests should not start until all health and safety issues, including evacuation planning, are resolved. But the one-page order from the three-judge appeals panel said: `` Petitions have failed to demonstrate the requisite irreparable injury and likelihood of success on the merits to warrant the preliminary relief sought.'' Plant officials said the license would be picked up by employees at <LOCATION> Seabrook </LOCATION>'s licensing office, which is near <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> headquarters. Plant spokesman <PERSON> Rob </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said Thursday that the license, and accompanying books of technical specifications, would be flown to <LOCATION> Seabrook </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Seabrook </LOCATION> officials said testing should begin within 10 days. The <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> approved the low-power license after <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON> officials set up a $ 72.1 million fund to cover the estimated added costs of mothballing the plant if it undergoes low-power testing but never operates commercially.

<HEAD>Doctors Save Man's Life By Using Fingers To Plug Bullet Holes in
Heart</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOLIET, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A man with two bullet wounds in his heart was saved by doctors who plugged the holes with their fingers until he could be transferred to a hospital with the needed equipment. The gunshot victim, <PERSON> Tommy </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Hairston </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Joliet </LOCATION>, underwent open heart surgery at <ORGANIZATION> Loyola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Maywood </LOCATION> on Thursday after doctors kept him alive during the helicopter flight from <LOCATION> Joliet </LOCATION>, 25 miles away. <PERSON> Hairston </PERSON>, 29, was listed in critical condition this morning, but is expected to recover, said nursing surpervisor <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Krzemienski </PERSON>. A neighbor who had a dispute with <PERSON> Hairston </PERSON> was charged with attempted murder. Dr. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Freeark </PERSON>, chief of surgery at <LOCATION> Loyola </LOCATION>, said doctors have had to use their fingers to plug wounds in the heart before, but he had never heard of a patient being kept alive for such a distance under such circumstances. `` To my knowledge, no one has ever transferred a patient by any means _ ambulance or certainly helicopter _ from one hospital to another while a surgeon had a finger occluding -LRB- blocking -RRB- a hole in the heart,'' <PERSON> Freeark </PERSON> said. Dr. <PERSON> Wendy </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>, a trauma surgeon and director of <ORGANIZATION> Loyola </ORGANIZATION>'s trauma center, was awakened at 5 a.m. Thursday by an urgent call from doctors at <LOCATION> Silver </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cross </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Joliet </LOCATION> They said they were using nothing but their fingers to plug two bullet holes in <LOCATION> Hairson </LOCATION>'s heart and `` could n't could n't stop the bleeding,'' Ms. <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> recounted. She took a medical helicopter to <LOCATION> Joliet </LOCATION>, where she used her own fingers to plug the holes as the victim was flown back to <LOCATION> Maywood </LOCATION>. Three times, when the man's heart stopped, she squeezed it to get it going again. `` Anyone who has got a blood pressure can be saved,'' she said. `` So you go for it.'' <PERSON> Hairston </PERSON>, a landscaper, was shot Wednesday night after an argument with a neighbor over missing property, police said. The neighbor, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Knox </PERSON>, was charged with attempted murder, armed violence and unlawful use of a weapon, police said. <PERSON> Hairston </PERSON> was rushed to <PERSON> Silver </PERSON> <PERSON> Cross </PERSON>, where he was operated on immediately but his heart was not opened up. However, after surgery, <PERSON> Hairston </PERSON> started bleeding again. `` This time, the surgeon opened <PERSON> Hairston </PERSON> up and found two holes in his heart,'' <PERSON> Freeark </PERSON> said. Because Silver Cross did n't have the proper equipment for the open-heart surgery, Ms. <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> was summoned and <PERSON> Hairston </PERSON> was transferred to <LOCATION> Loyola </LOCATION>. By Thursday afternoon, <PERSON> Hairston </PERSON> had awakened a few times, which is considered a positive sign, Ms. <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> said.

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Lukens </PERSON> was convicted today of having sex with a 16-year-old girl whose mother accused the congressman of offering a government job to buy her silence. The jury returned the verdict after deliberating for about one hour. <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> R-Ohio </LOCATION>, showed no emotion when the verdict was read. The 58-year-old divorced congressman was charged with contributing to the to the unruliness and delinquency of a minor, a misdemeanor that carries a maximum sentence of 180 days in jail and a $ 1,000 fine. Franklin County Domestic Relations Judge <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Solove </PERSON> ordered a presentence investigation but did not set a sentencing date. <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> stood during the reading of the verdict. Afterward, he remained at the defense's table momementarily and then was escorted out of the courtroom by his legal adviser. He made no comments to reporters. The girl, <PERSON> Rosie </PERSON> <PERSON> Coffman </PERSON>, was not in the courtroom when the verdict was announced. Neither was her mother, <PERSON> Anna </PERSON>, who also testified during the trial. Asked for comment, <PERSON> Luken </PERSON>'s chief of staff, <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Jarrell </PERSON>, looked down, shook his head and whispered, `` Not now.'' He said he did not know whether <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> would go back to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> immediately or stay in <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Serrott </PERSON>, an associate of <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION>' attorney, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyack </PERSON>, said the verdict would be appealed. The prosecutor said in summation arguments that <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> endangered the girl's morals, but <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION>' attorney attacked the 16-year-old's reputation. `` You've got to have some morals to get them endangered, do n't you? <PERSON> Tyack </PERSON> said in his closing statement. `` This is a classic case of throwing something against the wall and see if something sticks. <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> smiled as he entered the courtroom for the fifth day of his trial. But he became tense as Assistant Prosecutor <PERSON> Rita </PERSON> <PERSON> Mangini </PERSON> summarized her case before the jury. <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> gave the girl alcohol, paid for her cab ride to his apartment and had sex with her, Ms. <PERSON> Mangini </PERSON> said. He also tried `` to get her to commit a lesbian act with another ... individual,'' she said. <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> also caused Ms. <PERSON> Coffman </PERSON> `` to associate with immoral persons, namely the defendant.'' In testimony Thursday, a private investigator said <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> expressed fear for his political career the night he admitted that he had sex with a minor. <PERSON> J.D </PERSON>. <PERSON> Caudill </PERSON> testified that <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> became emotional after he made the admission. In previous testimony, Ms. <PERSON> Coffman </PERSON>'s mother said <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> tried to bribe her with an offer to help her find a government job. <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> claims she was trying to extort money from him in exchange for her silence. After four days of testimony and seven witnesses, the prosecution rested its case. The defense called no witnesses. <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> refused to answer outside the courtroom Thursday when asked why he did not take the stand. <PERSON> Caudill </PERSON>, who was hired in January by <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION>' former attorney, <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON>, to administer a polygraph test to <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION>, testified that <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> confessed to having sex with Ms. <PERSON> Coffman </PERSON> after initially denying the allegation. `` He admitted that he did have sexual intercourse with <PERSON> Rosie </PERSON> <PERSON> Coffman </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Caudill </PERSON>, a former <LOCATION> Dayton </LOCATION> police officer. He also said <PERSON> Lukens </PERSON> expressed fear for his political future. `` He told me that this was really going to destroy his career, that he had been dating a lady in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and he did n't know how he would tell her about this,'' <PERSON> Caudill </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> served two terms in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in the 1960s and was elected to the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> before returning to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1986.

 Would that world famous archeologist, <PERSON> Indiana </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, ever have imagined? His own hat and jacket have become the nation's artifacts. The <ORGANIZATION> Smithsonian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> History </ORGANIZATION> greeted with pretentious pomp Friday the arrival of its new objects: Indy's brown fedora and worn leather jacket. They were presented by <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>, the actor who has played the daring archeologist in two hit movies. `` I was surprised, flattered'' at the invitation, he insisted, although the whole thing was timed perfectly to plug the third Indy movie just out. His trademark attire is n't going on immediate display. But museum officials said it may someday take its place alongside such pop-culture treasures as <PERSON> Superman </PERSON>'s cape, <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON>'s slippers and <PERSON> Howdy </PERSON> <PERSON> Doody </PERSON> himself in the History of American Entertainment Collection. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> and his gifts were welcomed at a news conference, with as many cameras as any at the White House. Museum director <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> had <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> sign a `` deed of gift'' and did his best to find some profound significance in Indy, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>, and what they reflect in American culture. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>, as Indy, fights `` high-density mythological structures'' and brings the viewer `` escape from the bureaucratization of American life,'' the museum director said. He said Indy `` has a kind of redemptive diffidence.'' How's that? `` He is us at our baffled best,'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said. `` Mr. <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> has found a place for us in American drama. He has also managed to make it fun.'' <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s aw-shucks reply: `` That's rather more about me than I had any notion. I'm flattered to be here and have these artifacts on display.'' He donned the fedora for begging photographers, playfully flipped up the bill, and answered all the usual movie-star questions. No, he wo n't play Han Solo again in another Star Wars sequel. Adoring fans, he said, are `` very satisfied customers,'' a bit disturbing `` but it's a fair deal.'' For the record, the artifact facts: the fedora is size 7 \; the jacket is custom made in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, no size given And no, they were n't the only ones he wore in the films. He's kept one jacket for himself `` I'm sure all the rest have been destroyed _ shredded,'' he said, not convincing anyone. So, what would <PERSON> Indy </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> think of all this? `` He'd say, ` thank you very much,''' <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> said.

 Israeli and Syrian warplanes patrolled the sky Friday, and reports circulated that <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> was holding maneuvers and sending reinforcements for its battle with Lebanese Christians. Syrian troops and Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> army units fired machine guns and rocket-propelled grenades across <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s sectarian dividing line for two hours Police said no casualties were reported. An Arab League summit in <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION>, agreed to call for Syrian withdrawal from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, then dropped the demand. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> has 40,000 soldiers in the country under a peacekeeping mandate granted by the league in 1976, when the Lebanese civil war was a year old. An explosion was reported in the densely populated <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Samra </PERSON> neighborhood of <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION>, a Syrian-controlled port about 35 miles north of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Lebanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> said. The cause was not known immediately. `` It started a fire, but no details are available because telephone contacts with <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION> are down,'' a <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said.

An embassy spokesman, who would not let his name be used, said <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> `` was asked by the American government to go back to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> as a routine measure. He left yesterday.'' <PERSON> Al-Anwar </PERSON> said <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> was told `` to leave <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in 48 hours because the constitutional Lebanese government considers him persona non grata due to his hostile stands and practices.'' Christian newspapers have accused <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> of supporting <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s role in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> In addition to comanding the 20,000 Christians of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s army, <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> also leads one of the two rival governments that resulted from a political crisis last September Premier <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON> heads the Moslem cabinet. Artillery duels with Druse militiamen, soon joined by the Syrians, began March 8, two days after <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s forces blockaded illegal ports operated by Moslem militias. As the intensity increased, <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> declared the fight a war of liberation against the Syrians and said his goal was to drive them from the country. More than 350 people have been killed and nearly 1,400 wounded, nearly all of them civilians. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said the Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s Cabinet met to discuss reports that <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> had sent an armored armored brigade and helicopter-borne commandos into <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION>, the official <ORGANIZATION> Syria </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> said Syrian army, artillery, and air force units conducted mock attacks on ground troops, but did not say where the exercise took place. Syrian television quoted the defense minister, Gen. <PERSON> Mustafa </PERSON> <PERSON> Tlass </PERSON>, as saying without elaboration: `` The maneuver on a full-stage battle against the enemy was successful.'' A reliable source in <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION>, speaking on condition of anonymity, said he was `` almost certain'' the maneuvers did not take place in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Both the Christians and Syrians have stockpiled weapons and ammunition in the relative calm of a partially successful cease-fire the Arab League called two weeks ago. Reports have circulated in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> that the <ORGANIZATION> Syrians </ORGANIZATION> plan an assault on the 310-square-mile enclave east of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> where about 1 million Christians live. On Thursday, the Markaziyeh newsletter published in the Christian sector said 40 Syrian tanks and armored personnel carriers had entered <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and taken positions in mountains south and east of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> that overlook the Christian enclave. A spokesman for <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s Christian army units said two <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> warplanes broke the sound barrier at 35,000 feet over the <LOCATION> Chouf </LOCATION> mountains southeast of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> at noon Friday. The planes drew heavy anti-aircraft fire from <PERSON> Walid </PERSON> <PERSON> Jumblatt </PERSON>'s Druse militia but no hits were observed, he said Earlier, four Syrian jets criss-crossed the Christian enclave and <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> at high altitude, flying `` from the northern border to <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> for more than an hour,'' the spokesman said.

 Determined to prevent the terrorist attacks that marred the last visit to <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> by an American president, police adopted extraordinary security measures Friday to protect President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> is in a state of siege,'' said the state-run RAI television. Elite <ORGANIZATION> Carabinieri </ORGANIZATION> paramilitary policemen, armed with submachine guns and wearing bulletproof vests, guarded the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> on <LOCATION> Via </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Veneto </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador's residence a mile away and other American interests. Wary of possible car bombs, police roped off adjacent streets into no-parking zones. Authorities said more than 1,000 uniformed and plainclothes police had been deployed for security duties during <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s three-day visit Sharpshooters were posted on rooftops along <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s motorcade route Via <LOCATION> Veneto </LOCATION>, once synonymous with the `` <ORGANIZATION> Dolce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vita </ORGANIZATION>'' era of nightclubs and movie stars, was lined with pairs of policemen every few dozen feet. A blue police van was parked in front of the embassy gates, and another was stationed across the street in front of the Hotel Ambasciatori. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> embassy sits at the heart of what is known as the `` triangle of death,'' an area whose embassies, airline offices and popular tourist cafes have been a target of Arab terrorists. More than a dozen attacks, killing five people, have occurred in the area since 1979. On Wednesday, police explosives experts were called in to remove a suspicious car parked across from the embassy compound. They blew out the windows to get inside, but it turned out to be a false alarm. Police vans were also parked at every corner of the Villa Taverna, the seven-acre compound in the posh <LOCATION> Parioli </LOCATION> district where <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabb </PERSON> lives. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will be spending Friday and Saturday nights at the 17th century villa. <PERSON> Rabb </PERSON> served throughout <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s eight-year presidency and had been scheduled to leave last week but extended his stay because the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> has not yet acted on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s nomination of <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> businessman <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Secchia </PERSON>. The most recent anti-American terrorist attacks in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> occurred June 9, 1987, as President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and other leaders of the world's major industrialized nations were holding a summit meeting in <LOCATION> Venice </LOCATION> First, a car bomb exploded on Via Boncompagni along the side of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> compound, damaging other parked cars and blowing out two large windows in the nearby Hotel Excelsior. Except for an Italian woman passer-by who suffered from shock, there were no injuries. Less than an hour later, two homemade rockets were fired over the gates of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>, causing minor damage but no injuries. A similar rocket landed harmlessly in an ornamental pool at the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>, about a half-mile away. The rockets aimed at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> were launched from the balcony of a fifth-floor room of the Hotel Ambasciatori. The terrorists were never caught, but Italian authorities pieced together descriptions of suspects and issued arrest warrants for members of the <ORGANIZATION> Japanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, a Lebanese-based group sponsored by <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>. The same group was blamed for the car bomb attack on a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> servicemen's club in <LOCATION> Naples </LOCATION> in April 1988 that killed five people, including an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> woman. Security was also stepped up Friday at airports and train stations. Authorities said police helicopters and restricted air routes would be used for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s trips by helicopter. Police said the strict security measures were taken as a precaution, not because they had received any threats or indications of terrorist activity. Despite the tight security, advertisements were published in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> newspapers Friday inviting the public to the Memorial Day ceremony <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is scheduled to attend Sunday at the American World War II cemetery in <LOCATION> Nettuno </LOCATION>, about 45 miles south of <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>.

<DATELINE>ROCKFORD, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A grand jury refused to indict a young mother for manslaughter in her infant's death, which was linked to alleged cocaine use during pregnancy, authorities said today. Prosecutors had charged <PERSON> Melanie </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON>, 24, with involuntary manslaughter and delivery of a controlled substance to a minor, a charge usually used against street-corner drug dealers. A <LOCATION> Winnebago </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> grand jury that met Thursday did not indict her on any charge, State's Attorney <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Logli </PERSON> said. Ms. <PERSON> Green </PERSON>'s 2-day-old baby, <PERSON> Bianca </PERSON>, died Feb. 4. Cocaine was found in <PERSON> Bianca </PERSON>'s system and in her mother's, said Dr. <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Seward </PERSON>, the county coroner. The drug was carried through the placenta to the fetus, reducing <PERSON> Bianca </PERSON>'s ability to accept oxygen from the mother and resulting in brain damage. <PERSON> Logli </PERSON> had characterized that process as delivery of a controlled substance. Ms. <PERSON> Green </PERSON> had accepted an offer of free representation from the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> in the case. In a similar case, another mother in this northern <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> city of 140,000 was convicted May 1 of prenatal child abuse for using cocaine throughout her pregnancy, including the hours right before she gave birth. That child survived. On Thursday, the mother, whose name was not released because she is a juvenile, regained custody of her 6-month-old daughter. But Judge <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kapala </PERSON> made the custody arrangement temporary, pending a hearing July 6 in which the woman must demonstrate that she can give the baby a good home. `` If the mother is making progress and shows she is providing a nurturing environment for the child, the state is considering placing -LRB- full -RRB- guardianship with the mother,'' Assistant State's Attorney <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Golian </PERSON> said The child was placed in a foster home after <PERSON> Kapala </PERSON> found the woman guilty May 1 of prenatal abuse. At the time, the judge said he was forced to `` take a stand'' on the issue of fetus rights after testimony showed the woman had used cocaine up to a few hours before birth. The woman has completed a drug rehabilitation program, said her attorney, <PERSON> Alberto </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Altamore </PERSON>.

 From grand opera to chamber music, marionettes to <PERSON> Mozart </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Spoleto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Festival </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> U.S.A. </ORGANIZATION> will serve up a smorgasbord of the arts over the next 16 days in <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>. The 13th edition of the festival, founded by composer <PERSON> Gian </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlo </PERSON> <PERSON> Menotti </PERSON>, opened today with a ceremony on the steps of City Hall. `` Let the music begin, let the dancers dance, let the choirs sing and let the children play,'' Mayor <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Riley </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> announed in his traditional proclamation. `` I hereby declare that the 13th <ORGANIZATION> Spoleto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Festival </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> U.S.A. </ORGANIZATION> has begun.'' Chamber music, <PERSON> Bellini </PERSON>'s opera `` La Straniera,'' and <PERSON> Eileen </PERSON> <PERSON> Heckart </PERSON> and <PERSON> Joanna </PERSON> <PERSON> Gleason </PERSON> in the Lee Blessing play `` Eleemosynary'' were on tap for the festival's opening day. During the festival, 111 performances will be presented before <LOCATION> Spoleto </LOCATION> closes amid a thundering fireworks display over <ORGANIZATION> Middleton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Place </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plantation </ORGANIZATION> on June 11. Festival organizers were predicting a record box office, with ticket sales running $ 127,000 ahead of last year, festival spokeswoman <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said Thursday. Almost $ 1.2 million in tickets have been sold compared to $ 1.32 million sold during the entire festival last year. Even before this year's festival opened, three productions were acknowledged hits. Tickets for `` The <ORGANIZATION> Marriage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Figaro </ORGANIZATION>'' _ directed by <PERSON> Menotti </PERSON> _ sold out two days after the box office opened in March. Only a handful of tickets remain for the return engagement of the Colla Family Marionettes. The Italian puppets were one of the highlights of the 1987 festival. The Young Conductors Concert featuring little-known works by <PERSON> Mozart </PERSON> is also a sellout. `` Everything else has some tickets left on certain dates,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>. `` There's plenty left, especially in the final week.'' Other major events at the festival include <PERSON> Laurie </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> premiering her newest work, titled `` Empty Places'' in which 10,000 images will be juxtaposed to music on more than a dozen moveable screens at the <ORGANIZATION> Gaillard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Municipal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auditorium </ORGANIZATION>. The <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ballet </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Trisha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION> will also perform and there will be a performance of <PERSON> Mozart </PERSON>'s `` Requiem.'' <PERSON> Menotti </PERSON> started a festival in <LOCATION> Spoleto </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, in 1957 with the aim of merging the cultural worlds of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 Conservatives who gained control of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leadership in a bitter power struggle activated time-tested education mechanisms Friday for ensuring control at the grassroots as well. The television news said party members and soldiers attended lengthy meetings to study May 19 speeches in which Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> and President <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> <PERSON> Shangkun </PERSON> announced troops would `` restore order'' after more than a month of student-led protests for democracy. Political study sessions have been an important element of the party's grassroots control during 40 years of rule. Once top leaders set a new party line, meetings routinely are called at every level to study it, from the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> down to the local cell. Party members then are expected to take the lead in educating non-members at study sessions in workplaces and mass organizations. In the current power struggle, the meetings will be especially important because so many party members, security forces and <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> residents took part in the demonstrations now being denounced. Army cadets, soldiers of the logistics department, police, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Youth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> and employees of government ministries were among the marchers. The party, never satisfied with simply issuing an order from above, will be trying to win over as many people as possible and frighten the rest into silent cooperation. Party members who shouted, `` Down with <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON>!'' in the anonymity of a crowd of hundreds of thousands will be unlikely to dare speak out in a small study session of their peers. Chinese sources said the main texts being studied Friday were the speeches <PERSON> Li </PERSON> and <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> made on national TV just before declaring martial law in parts of the capital; an internal report on the protests by <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s party chief; and speeches made Thursday by <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> and former President <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiannian </PERSON> at a Politburo meeting that voted to back the hardliners. Party members praised the <PERSON> Li </PERSON> and <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> speeches as `` very important'' and said they `` represented the will of the entire party,'' the nationally televised evening news said. The television also showed troops who have been ordered to impose martial law taking part in study sessions. The troops have been quartered on the outskirts of <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> since last weekend when hundreds of thousands of citizens blocked their way into the capital. The `` dare-to-die units'' of citizens who blockaded the troop trucks administered their own kind of propaganda, lecturing the soldiers for hours on end about the student protesters' goals of increasing democracy and wiping out corruption. They gave the soldiers food, water and cigarettes and urged them not to hurt the students. In an apparent effort to counteract the people's propaganda, army officers lectured the troops Friday on their martial law mission. The television showed soldiers sitting in small groups in their tents, their bedrolls neatly stashed behind them, studying a harsh letter from the top army command that claimed a small group of people were using the students to attack the party leadership. Education has yet to begin in earnest in ordinary workplaces, where most efforts so far have been directed at keeping employees from joining demonstrations. Some employers have threatened dismissal or fines for anyone who marches, others have tried to bribe workers with free food and drink to stay in. Some large workplaces also formed worker militias, ostensibly to help keep order on the streets but in reality to keep workers occupied at night.

 Finding this room with a view was no problem for <PERSON> Isaac </PERSON>, <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON>, <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hector </PERSON>. But the bulldozers? They will definitely be a problem. All four live in a squalid yet sophisticated cluster of shacks on the elevated <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Side </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Highway </LOCATION>, overlooking the <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>. The 15-block stretch of highway, raised on rusting girders, has been closed since a truck fell through the decaying roadway in 1973. Workers started razing the highway 11 blocks up on Thursday and will inch their way downtown. The shack residents vow to stay until the last moment. `` We've moved them a few times and they just keep returning,'' said <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwartz </PERSON>, deputy transportation commissioner. `` They like the vista and many are attached to the setting. But there'll come a day when they ca n't return. Once, the highway was dotted with dozens of trash-strewn huts of plywood, nails, carpet remnants and blue plastic tarp. Just four remain. Early Thursday, a police officer rapped his nightstick on the hut that <PERSON> Linda </PERSON>, <PERSON> Hector </PERSON>, <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> and <PERSON> Isaac </PERSON> share. `` You've got to get out _ we're bringing dynamite,'' said the officer. This, though, is their home. They tap electricity from a light pole to run their television, cooler, lights, heater, even a vacuum cleaner. The women, both soap opera buffs, seldom miss `` Loving'' and `` General Hospital.'' `` It's peaceful and it's calm up here. Sometimes, sightseers come by and take pictures. I guess they think we're all maniacs,'' <PERSON> Isaac </PERSON> said, as tourists gawked from the deck of the Intrepid, an aircraft carrier-turned-museum. <PERSON> Isaac </PERSON>, who described himself as an out-of-work carpenter, plumber and electrician, said he once shared a girlfriend's condominium When that fizzled out, he moved onto the highway in November. His friends joined him last winter. `` I'm not homeless,'' he says emphatically. `` People who are homeless are living on the subway; they do n't change their clothes.'' It took <PERSON> Isaac </PERSON> a day to build his hut after scavenging `` a piece here, a piece there _ nails, wire, tape.'' The address, he says with a grin, is `` Bridge, Apartment 221.'' He sometimes visits his sister's home. Once he caught himself walking hunched over _ conditioning from his own 4-foot-high ceiling. `` I straightened up right away. If they knew where I lived, they'd say, ` You're 36 years old and you're embarrassing the family. Are you crazy?''' `` I'm from <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. If my mother saw me living like this, she'd kill me,'' agreed his girlfriend <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON>, 34, an unemployed factory worker and waitress `` I always wanted to come to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and I finally did. People know your business too much in a little town. But the rent here is so high _ you can rent a whole house in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> for $ 400 a month,'' she said. `` Now,'' said <PERSON> Isaac </PERSON>, `` they're telling us to go to the shelter. What are we supposed to do: She goes to one shelter and I go to another?'' he said, pointing to <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON>, who is three months pregnant. `` The shelters are not safe. I'm not going to a shelter. We leave our TV and our clothes here, with no locks, and all our stuff is still here when we get back. Try that in an apartment in the neighborhood where you live. We look out for one another. Kids do n't come up here and go wilding.'' <PERSON> Linda </PERSON>, who asked that her last name be withheld because `` I have kids in college and it would be embarrassing for them,'' said the hut-dwellers were `` like one big, happy family. On the street, a guy slammed me up against a wall and put a knife up to me. That's never happened up here. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON>, another hut dweller, makes money gathering cans and scrap metal. `` Whatever we have, we share,'' he said. `` And the view is nice. I've got my Intrepid right here. I've got my view of the skyline. My boats, they come in and out. This is the best.'' When the dozers arrive, <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> may search for a vacant lot. `` I do n't know exactly what I'm going to do,'' he said. `` But I'll be here until the bitter end.''

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Mengistu </PERSON> <PERSON> Haile </PERSON> <PERSON> Mariam </PERSON> has named new armed forces commanders to replace those killed last week in an abortive coup led by war-weary generals, <LOCATION> Addis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ababa </LOCATION> radio announced. <ORGANIZATION> Mengistu </ORGANIZATION> also named new navy and police chiefs, but made no mention of the fate of the former navy commander and police chief. The appointments were made Wednesday. Diplomats say nearly the entire military high command was killed in the three-day revolt crushed May 18 and subsequent purge in this strategic nation that is the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s strongest ally in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. The new appointees will command the continent's largest and best-equipped force of 325,000 troops, although many are unwilling conscripts. All but two of the new military leaders are central committee members of the <ORGANIZATION> Marxist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>, this <PERSON> Horn </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> nation's sole legal political party. Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Addis </PERSON> <PERSON> Tedla </PERSON>, the deputy prime minister and a Politburo member, is the new chief of staff. Other appointees with their new titles are Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Seyoum </PERSON> <PERSON> Mekonen </PERSON> and Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Mesfin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gebre </PERSON> <PERSON> Kal </PERSON>, deputy chiefs of staff; and Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Embibel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ayele </PERSON>, commander of ground forces. Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Alemayehu </PERSON> <PERSON> Agonafir </PERSON> becomes air force commander while <PERSON> Yfhuwal </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashet </PERSON> <PERSON> Girma </PERSON> was named navy commander with the rank of rear admiral. <PERSON> Berhanu </PERSON> <PERSON> Jembere </PERSON>, a former ambassador to <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> who has had charge of the government agency dealing with drought and other disasters, takes command of the 1st Army with the rank of major general. Other appointments are: Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Gimar </PERSON> <PERSON> Neway </PERSON>, to head the police; Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Wubishet </PERSON> <PERSON> Dessie </PERSON>, 2nd Army commander; and Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Gebre </PERSON> <PERSON> Giorgis </PERSON> <PERSON> Berhanu </PERSON>, 2nd <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> deputy commander and its political commissar. No one was named defense minister to replace Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Haile </PERSON> <PERSON> Giorgis </PERSON> <PERSON> Habte </PERSON> <PERSON> Mariam </PERSON>, who was killed by rebellious generals when he tried to halt their coup attempt. The government made no mention of casualties in the mutiny. Initially it was announced that loyal troops killed three generals: Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Merid </PERSON> <PERSON> Negussie </PERSON>, then chief of staff; Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Amha </PERSON> <PERSON> Desta </PERSON>, air force commander; and Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Denissie </PERSON> <PERSON> Bulto </PERSON>, 2nd Army commander. But <PERSON> Mengistu </PERSON> told a rally last week that the three committed suicide rather than surrender. <ORGANIZATION> Mengistu </ORGANIZATION> has blamed the three dead generals for military defeats in northern <LOCATION> Eritrea </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tigre </LOCATION> provinces, where it is fighting rebels who want more power for their ethnic minorities. The Eritrean <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, waging a 28-year war for secession, and the <ORGANIZATION> Tigrean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, which seeks more autonomy, recently have scored major victories and chased government troops from most of the countryside and small towns. Many troops in the 150,000-strong 2nd <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, which has done most of the fighting and has its headquarters in the Eritrean capital of <LOCATION> Asmara </LOCATION>, backed the coup.

A source close to the paper, who spoke only on condition of anonymity, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> today that no formal action had been taken but was expected early next week. `` She is not yet not the editor,'' the source said. A spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubenstein </PERSON>, would neither confirm nor deny the reports. He said a statement by <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> owner <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kalikow </PERSON> may be issued later today or Tuesday. `` She's still working for the paper, there's no question about that. She's still the editor'' today, <PERSON> Rubenstein </PERSON> said. He would not comment on her plans. <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION>'s secretary at the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION> was not in the office today and was not expected. The secretary said all calls on the subject were being forwarded to <PERSON> Rubenstein </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION>, 37, became one of six women editing a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> newspaper with a circulation larger than 100,000 on June 13. She had a three-year contract. She previously was editor of <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>, inc. magazine and worked for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>. `` There is a parting of the ways, but <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> has not been fired,'' a source closely connected with the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> told <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newsday </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> also quoted a source as saying, `` There was a mutual parting of the ways.'' Both reports said <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION>'s resignation may have resulted over the decision to scale back the newspaper's 11-week-old Sunday edition. The Post announced it was reducing the paper to a single section and cutting the price from $ 1 to 40 cents due to a lack of advertising in the Sunday section. <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION> was heavily involved in creating the Sunday edition. She would be the second top news executive to leave the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> recently. Publisher <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Price </PERSON>, 48, left the newspaper last month to begin a national sports newspaper.

 House Democratic Whip <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>, despite questions about his business dealings, will jump in `` with both feet'' if the majority leader's position becomes vacant, setting up a likely confrontation with Rep. <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON>, D-Ga., congressional sources said today The two-way race for the No. 2 leadership post shaped up as, sources said, Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Mo </LOCATION>., had decided against seeking the job The jockeying came in expectation that Rep. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, would resign as <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> speaker next week in the wake of charges that he committed 69 rules violations and Majority Leader <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, D-Wash., would replace him <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> had been urged by some <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Democrats to challenge <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>, whose own personal business dealings have come under scrutiny, to spare the party further embarrassment should an ethics probe ensue. One source said <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> was interested in running for <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>'s current job of majority whip, the No 3 spot in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Democratic heirarchy. Spokeswoman <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Johns </PERSON> said <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> was `` waiting to see what the speaker is going to do. He's listening to people and at this time he just has n't made a decision.'' <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON> `` will be a candidate for the position when the speaker resigns,'' said a source close to the <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> lawmaker, who is running with support from the powerful chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ill </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON> `` usually supports the members of his committee and only one of them -LRB- <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON> -RRB- is in the race right now,'' said a source close to the chairman None of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> sources would allow their names to be used. `` When a vacancy occurs for the position of majority leader, I fully expect <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> to be in with both feet and running to win,'' said one source. Asked if <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> would run against his close friend, <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>, the source said, `` That's not going to happen.'' The source indicated the information came from a personal conversation between the two congressmen. <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Dreyer </PERSON> would not reveal the Californian's future plans Early in 1988, <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> organized a campaign trip for several dozen colleagues and lobbyists who flew to <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> to boost the presidential campaign of <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>. The two have remained close. A group of <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>'s supporters on Thursday urged him to run, viewing the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> Democrat as a `` white hat'' figure who could help his party recover from the ethical problems that appear to have ruined <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s career. Some House Democrats worried that ethics questions recently raised about <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>'s financial dealings could make him a political liability if the Californian succeeded <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> as majority leader. But <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> also is remembered fondly by many Democrats from his days as the Democratic congressional campaign chairman who doled out the money that got many of the lawmakers elected. <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> not only organized the campaign trip for <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, but was present for the ex-candidate's most triumphant moment during the 1988 Democratic primary season _ when the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> congressman won the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> precinct caucuses on Feb. 8 that year. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> is expected to resign next week just as he faces disciplinary proceedings over <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics committee charges of 69 rules violations. That would free <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> to move up to speaker and likely trigger races for majority leader, majority whip and possibly caucus chairman. Some House Democrats suggested that the party quickly elevate <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> and allow several weeks to pass before deciding on other leadership positions. Rep. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, D-Mont., said he favors such a course, but added that the <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> camp wants the incumbents to quickly move up the ladder <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>'s strongest support appeared to come from his own <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Democratic delegation, whose chairman, Rep. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>, said, `` We just think <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> has been the best whip in the history of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, and deserves to be majority leader.'' Another Californian, Rep. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Calif </LOCATION>., said he backs <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> for majority leader but admitted that `` members will take into consideration the public reaction to the situation. `` We must make sure nobody who is in a replacement mode has any impediments that cause problems,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Glickman </PERSON>, D-Kan. `` If we have a secondary ethics problem, it could be very catastrophic for our party in the House We're on somewhat shaky footing now and need to re-establish our stability.' News stories have detailed, and <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> has confirmed, that a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> savings and loan official purchased a $ 100,000, high-yield junk bond for the lawmaker in 1986 _ after <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> found himself unable to finance the purchase himself. A month later, the bank official sold the bond to <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> for the initial offering price, which saved the lawmaker about $ 4,000 compared with the market price at the time. House rules prohibit members from accepting gifts from anyone with a direct interest in legislation. <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> said he did not violate <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> rules, and asked the ethics committee to review the transaction. On Thursday, the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported that the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is conducting a preliminary criminal investigation of whether <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> received favors from <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the firm that issued the junk bond. <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> said in a statement, `` I am confident the story is inaccurate and I so advised the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, which chose to go ahead with the story anyway. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s current atmosphere, such stories based on rumors or leaks are perhaps inevitable, but no less regrettable.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> reported earlier this week that <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> owned an interest in a dairy management company at the same time he was pushing legislation to help maintain the profitability of some dairy farms.

 Israeli officials are keeping a close watch on the Syrian military buildup in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> but said Friday they see no immediate danger to their northern border. The Cabinet met Thursday night about reports that a mechanized brigade had joined the 40,000 Syrian soldiers already in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, where a Syrian-Druse alliance has been been fighting Christian army soldiers since early March. Most officials and observers said <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s objective seemed to be convincing the <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> summit in <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION> it would not leave <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> rather than posing a threat to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. `` As long as we do n't feel directly threatened, there is no way <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> is going to intervene,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Alon </PERSON> <PERSON> Liel </PERSON>. Col. <PERSON> Renaan </PERSON> <PERSON> Gissin </PERSON>, deputy army spokesman, said: `` Clearly any change of forces on the ground is a concern to us. We are watching to see if this presents any threat to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s northern border or the security zone.'' That zone is a strip of Lebanese territory just north of the border, varying in depth from six to 10 miles, patrolled by <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers and a mainly Christian surrogate militia called the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lebanon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. Military sources said privately the army had not raised the alert status of its border units. Concern about a Syrian move southward or an expansion of the Syrian-Christian fight in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> was evident, however. `` Any war on our northern border is not good because of the potential to spill over,'' a government official said, on condition of anomyity. <PERSON> Zeev </PERSON> <PERSON> Eitan </PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Tel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviv </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Jaffee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION>, said Israeli reconnaissance flights could be hampered if <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> moved anti-aircraft missiles into new areas of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Ben-Ishai </PERSON>, military correspondent of the independent daily <ORGANIZATION> Yediot </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ahronot </ORGANIZATION>, noted that military actions sometimes go beyond the planned scope and said on army radio: `` it's known that in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, often without intention, things can escalate.''

<TEXT>
 Eighty percent of the nation's commercial radio stations gave their listeners dead air for 30 seconds Friday as a taste of what it would mean not to have radio. The period of silence opened a $ 100 million national advertising campaign, `` Radio: What Would Life be Like Without It.'' `` Imagine if all your days sounded like this,'' the recorded voice of actor <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said at 7:42 a.m. EST. Then nothing until <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> came on again saying: `` Thirty seconds seems like a long time, does n't it? Now think how radio fills that silence for you.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advertising </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>, which said about 8,000 stations participated, called the spot the biggest simultaneous promotion in the history of radio. Over the next year the campaign will produce other broadcast commercials as well as magazine and newspaper ads to attract potential advertisers, said <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Flamberg </PERSON>, the bureau vice president.

 When <PERSON> Reijo </PERSON> <PERSON> Kela </PERSON> finally stepped out in public on Friday after a week indoors, it was as though he'd never left. For seven days, <PERSON> Kela </PERSON> lived inside a small glass house in a busy section of downtown <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION>. He ate, he bathed, he danced, he went to the bathroom _ he did everything inside his diaphanous digs but throw stones. When the 37-year-old performance artist finally emerged, he was greeted with roses, pink champagne and applause from some of the passersby who had watched a man live life in a fishbowl. `` It's just another production ... but I lived it with every inch of my soul. Thank you all for your support,'' said <PERSON> Kela </PERSON>, wearing a dark suit and bow tie. An estmated 100,000 people daily passed by <PERSON> Kela </PERSON>'s temporary home, set up on a stage near one of <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION>'s busiest public squares. The structure, glassed-in on two sides, was equipped with sleeping bag, stereo system, telephone, two laundry baskets, fresh flowers and, unashamedly, a see-through bathtub. The week-long performance, titled `` Cityman,'' receiving $ 19,000 in support from Finnish cultural authorities and the <ORGANIZATION> Helsinki </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Students </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Kela </PERSON> made no prior announcement before turning himself into a human goldfish on May 19. He said he was happy about the reactions he got from his transparent attempt to merge art and everyday life. `` Some people turned nasty in the evenings, mainly drunks, and even though I had my own personal guard nearby I found sleeping difficult on the first two nights,'' <PERSON> Kela </PERSON> told reporters. `` Most people were positive. They laughed and enjoyed themselves, which is the main thing,'' <PERSON> Kela </PERSON> said. Women from <PERSON> Kela </PERSON>'s dance troupe provided food trays and joined him for entertainment in the evenings. <PERSON> Kela </PERSON> danced to music and advertisements from commercial radio stations that blared over loudspeakers both inside and outside the glass bowl. He figured he danced about 10 hours daily. They were occasionally interrupted with recorded messages by <PERSON> Kela </PERSON> announcing in English that he is `` the Cityman. The Best. Everyone wants my body. Everyone would like to make love to me.'' <PERSON> Kela </PERSON> said the message of `` Cityman'' was in the words and in his dance. When asked if his performance was meant as a kind of social protest, he said `` the dance speaks for itself.'' <PERSON> Kela </PERSON> was recently granted a five-year grant from the <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>. Organizers from the Student Union said there were no problems with the police or public. `` We only had one complaint and that was for allowing radio commercials to be aired in public,'' he said.

<HEAD>14 Blacks Sentenced to Death For Mob Killing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GREG MYRE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A judge Friday sentenced 14 blacks to hang for the mob killing of a black policeman, in a ruling likely to stir widespread protest. Only one of the group of 13 men and a 60-year-old woman was found to have inflicted blows that caused the death of <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> <PERSON> Sethwala </PERSON>. He was stoned and set afire Nov. 13, 1985, because of his work for <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s racist government. `` The <LOCATION> Upington </LOCATION> trial is an outrage that only the apartheid system can produce,'' protested the South African Council of Churches, which includes most of the country's leading Protestant denominations. `` We can not be convinced that justice has been done,'' it said. The Lawyers for Human Rights organization said the 14 are the largest group ever condemned to death for a single crime in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. Altogether, 25 blacks have been convicted of murder in the killing that took place at <LOCATION> Paballelo </LOCATION> black township outside <LOCATION> Upington </LOCATION>, a remote northwestern city. Eleven remaining defendants are expected to be sentenced to prison terms. On Friday, the 14 defendants sang an African hymn as they marched into <LOCATION> Upington </LOCATION> courthouse, knowing they would get death sentences because the judge ruled Thursday there was no excuse for their actions. The death sentence is mandatory for people convicted of murder in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> unless the judge finds mitigating circumstances. Most of those sentenced Friday proclaimed their innocence before Supreme Court Judge <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Basson </PERSON>. `` I am an elderly woman and have been found guilty for something I have not done,'' said <PERSON> Evelina </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Bruin </PERSON>. `` Other people committed this crime.'' Justice <PERSON> Bekebeke </PERSON>, the only defendant found to have inflicted blows in the killing, did not maintain his innocence. But the 24-year-old told the court the case was `` based on racial prejudice.'' Lawyer <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Durbach </PERSON> said the sentences will be appealed. The so-called <LOCATION> Upington </LOCATION> 25 were convicted in April 1988 under the principle of common purpose, which holds a person responsible for crowd actions if they were part of the group. The day of the killing, about 3,000 blacks gathered on a soccer field to protest rent increases. Police dispersed the crowd, and most went home peacefully except for about 300 who regrouped and attacked <PERSON> Sethwala </PERSON>. Prosecutors said the <LOCATION> Upington </LOCATION> 25 were in the crowd that pelted <PERSON> Sethwala </PERSON>'s house with stones. <PERSON> Sethwala </PERSON> fired a gun out the window, wounding a small boy. Defense lawyers said this incited the crowd to force the victim from his house, assault him and set him ablaze. The judge said the killing was politically motivated, part of a conspiracy to attack authorities. <PERSON> Basson </PERSON> rejected arguments that individual defendants can not be held accountable for actions of a crowd. One of those convicted was described by witnesses as a close friend of the victim. The principle of common purpose also was used against the `` <ORGANIZATION> Sharpeville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Six </ORGANIZATION>,'' a group of black men and women convicted of slaying a black town councilor. After an international campaign, President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> last year commuted their death sentences to lengthy prison terms.

 The judge who sentenced a white racist to hang for killing seven blacks and an Indian man is under police protection for fear of revenge attacks, newspapers reported Friday. Police headquarters refused to confirm or deny reports that <ORGANIZATION> Pretoria </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Louis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harms </ORGANIZATION>, two assistants and two prosecutors are under protective surveillance since Thursday's sentencing of <PERSON> Barend </PERSON> <PERSON> Strydom </PERSON> <PERSON> Strydom </PERSON>, 23, was convicted of killing seven people and wounding 15 blacks in a shooting spree in <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION> on Nov. 15. `` There is concern that right-wing political agitators may attack the judge and his associates,'' The Star newspaper said. The black taxi driver who disarmed <PERSON> Strydom </PERSON> said Friday he may flee the area because of harassment by white extremists. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> <PERSON> Mkondeleli </PERSON>, 33, took refuge in a newspaper office Thursday when he was chased by several whites after the sentencing. <PERSON> Strydom </PERSON>, a former policeman, belonged to the <ORGANIZATION> Afrikaner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resistance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> which seeks to establish a whites-only state. He testified during his trial that he believes blacks are subhuman and he wanted his attack to provoke a `` war of freedom'' to ensure white dominance. The extreme <ORGANIZATION> Boerestaat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> has described <PERSON> Strydom </PERSON> as `` a sensitive Afrikaner patriot'' and is campaigning for his clemency. In editorials Friday, pro-government newspapers said <PERSON> Strydom </PERSON>'s fanaticism is not unique `` It was not just one misguided and confused young man,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Beeld </ORGANIZATION>, the largest Afrikaans-language daily. `` The offensive opinions of a fanatical minority were heard and found guilty. `` The fact that <PERSON> Strydom </PERSON> is hailed as a hero in these circles leaves no doubt as to the viciousness of the right's sickness.'' A more liberal newspaper, The Argus of <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>, said the government's racist policies are partly to blame for <PERSON> Strydom </PERSON>'s views It described him as `` a Frankenstein monster, lurching out of a dark and bitter past.'' In a separate case, the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> confirmed Friday that it has reprieved <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Burt </PERSON>, a white facing execution for murdering a black policeman. His sentence was commuted to 20 years in prison. <PERSON> Burt </PERSON> was convicted in 1987 of killing Sgt. <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON> <PERSON> Ndimande </PERSON> and trying to make it appear black radicals had committed the crime by using the `` necklace'' method. Numerous suspected government collaborators were executed in 1984-86 by `` necklacing,'' in which a gasoline-soaked tire is placed around a victim's neck and set alight.

<HEAD>Yang Shangkun Emerges as Key Player in Power Struggle</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-China, Bjt</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> <PERSON> Shangkun </PERSON>, an elderly general and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s ceremonial head of state, has emerged as a major player in the struggle for control of the government <PERSON> Yang </PERSON>, 81, has been a leading spokesman for the hardline policy of imposing martial law on <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> and crushing the student uprising. <PERSON> Yang </PERSON>, on the night of May 19, appeared on national TV with Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> to announce that troops would be brought in to restore order to the capital. Chinese sources said <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> also delivered a speech to party and government leaders on Thursday that strongly condemned Communist Party General Secretary <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON> for being sympathetic to the student cause. <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON>, one of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s leading reformers, has been stripped of his post in connection with the recent disturbances, sources say. Students occupying Tiananmen Square have reacted in anger to <PERSON> Yang </PERSON>'s statements, demanding that he, along with <PERSON> Li </PERSON> and <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>, step down. <PERSON> Yang </PERSON>, a jovial man who is quick to smile, seems out of place in the role of the iron-fisted disciplinarian. Because of his long association with senior leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON> and his public statements, he has been regarded as a solid supporter of economic reforms and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s opening to the world. When he became president, or head of state, in April 1988, he spoke of the `` longing of the people of all our nationalities for a dramatic change in the face of the country.'' <PERSON> Yang </PERSON>, as ranking military man in the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> headed by <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>, has also worked closely with <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> to bring about reform in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s oversized, technically backward army. He helped direct the 1985-87 effort to reduce the size of the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> from 4.2 million to about 3.2 million people, and led the campaign to abandon <PERSON> Mao </PERSON>'s concept of a revolutionary guerrilla force in favor of a modern, well-equipped army. But like <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>, <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> suffered during the turmoil of the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution, and apparently shares his aversion to social instability. When the student movement swelled beyond control, <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> joined <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> and the forces of law and order. <PERSON> Yang </PERSON>, born in 1907 in <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>'s home province of <LOCATION> Sichuan </LOCATION>, studied for four years in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> before returning to join the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> in the Long March, the epic 1934-35 flight from <PERSON> Chiang </PERSON> <PERSON> Kai-shek </PERSON>'s pursuing Nationalist forces. Always an administrator rather than a military strategist, he became secretary-general of the party's military commission in 1945. After the communist victory in 1949, he was given the key administrative post of director of the general office of the party <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, a post he held until the Cultural Revolution began in 1966.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> today expelled three British diplomats and a businessman in what the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> called an unjustified retaliation for the recent expulsion of four Czechoslovaks from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. A Foreign Office spokesman said Czechoslovak authorities told the <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Laurence </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Keefe </PERSON>, the four Britons must leave in two weeks because of `` unacceptable activities,'' diplomatic jargon for spying. `` It's clearly an unjustified action,'' said the spokesman, speaking anonymously in keeping with British custom. `` It's clearly in retaliation.'' He identified the four Britons as the embassy's <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Secretary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tony </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arnold </ORGANIZATION>, First Secretary Counsellor <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Todd </PERSON>, Third Secretary <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Holland </PERSON> and a manager of <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON>. Earlier today, the <ORGANIZATION> Czechoslovak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> daily, Rude Pravo, called the expulsion of its diplomats another case of `` British spymania, which certain British circles bring about from time to time.'' On May 19, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> expelled eight Soviet diplomats and three journalists and <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> retaliated in kind a day later. The Soviets then demanded that <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> reduce to 205 the number of Britons and their locally hired support staff in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in order to match the quota of Soviets allowed in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commons </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday that the expulsions of the Soviets and the Czechoslovaks were vital `` regardless of the effect upon our relations.'' Before the expulsions, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> had been enjoying its best relations with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> since World War II. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> also had been improving relations with <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, partly because <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> authorities want help in detecting the Czechoslovak-made explosive Semtex used by the <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> and other terrorist groups. Sir <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Fretwell </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> politcal director, said <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> had ignored warnings to rein in its diplomats in September 1988, when three others were expelled.

<TEXT>
 The governments of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> have made progress toward ending the fighting between Afghan troops and Moslem guerrillas based in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, officials said Friday. `` <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> is becoming increasingly important. They oppose a military solution,'' said one Afghan government official closely involved in the negotiations. The official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> was considering telling the guerrillas based there to make a deal with Afghan President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, which supports <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>. He said <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> is eager to begin repatriating an estimated 2 million Afghans who have sought exile in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> during the 11-year-old war between Afghan forces and Moslem guerrillas. In addition, he said, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> wants to establish closer ties with the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>. The guerrillas are split into factions based in both <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. The Tehran-based eight-party alliance represents the <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Moslem </ORGANIZATION> minority of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. It is at odds with the Pakistan-based alliance of Sunni Moslems. `` <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> has been making overtures to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and to our government,'' said a close adviser to the Afghan president. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, refused to elaborate on the talks. Soviet Ambassador <PERSON> Yuli </PERSON> <PERSON> Vorontsov </PERSON> held talks with the resistance coalition during a four-day visit to <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> recently. Senior Soviet diplomats in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> said <PERSON> Vorontsov </PERSON> called the talks very good. The meetings were his first since the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> pulled the last of its troops from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> on Feb. 15, ending a nine-year military involvment. The Soviet officials said <PERSON> Vorontsov </PERSON> said the rebels opposed foreign interference and wanted an Afghan government composed of all groups. The Soviets have said they also want this. This week, Pakistani Foreign Minister <PERSON> Sahabzada </PERSON> <PERSON> Yaqub </PERSON> suggested <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> also resume talks with Afghan rebels in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> made contact with Afghan rebels based in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> in December, but the U.S.-backed guerrillas said they would not talk to the Soviets until <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> stopped aiding the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> government.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON>, a pragmatic visionary who reversed leftist economic policies that had devastated the economy, showed himself a rigid hardliner in politics when he led a purge of liberals this week. It was the third time in a decade of rule as <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s senior leader that <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> responded to calls for democracy with a crackdown. For the second time, the chief victim was a former <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> protege, in this case Communist Party General Secretary <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON>. Sources said Friday that <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> was under house arrest after the party Politburo voted to strip him of his post. At least one other liberal official also was reported under house arrest, while others were said to be in trouble. <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> was a hero to many Chinese a decade ago when he began his `` second revolution'' that disbanded <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> <PERSON> Tse-tung </PERSON>'s communes and allowed private enterprise. But the many students and supporters who paraded through the streets of <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> and other cities the past six weeks made him a figure of ridicule. They likened him to <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> as a leader who clung hungrily to power long after his mandate was lost. `` <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON>, your time is up,'' some wrote bluntly on posters carried in marches over the past two weeks. Children chanted: `` Your mind is not sharp.'' But the 84-year-old <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>, who survived two purges under <PERSON> Mao </PERSON>, showed he was still adept in games of power. It apparently was at his orders that Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> declared martial law in central <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> on May 20, and his power base in the military that decided a subsequent behind-the-scenes contest between him and <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON>. <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> stepped down from his main party posts in 1987 but remained chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> told visiting Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> at last week's historic summit that the party decided in 1987 it still needed <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>'s guidance in `` most important questions.'' In the all-important question of how to handle the widening student-led protests, it was <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> who had the final say. <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> was born on Aug. 22, 1904, the eldest son of a wealthy landowner in the southwest province of <LOCATION> Sichuan </LOCATION>. His original name was <PERSON> Kan </PERSON> <PERSON> Zegao </PERSON>, but he changed it to <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON> _ `` Little Peace'' _ when he joined the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in 1924 while on a work-study program in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. He later studied at <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and returned to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> to become a guerrilla leader and party officer in the civil war against the ruling Nationalists. After the Communist victory in 1949, he became vice premier under <PERSON> Chou </PERSON> <PERSON> En-lai </PERSON>. But while <PERSON> Chou </PERSON> managed to survive the Cultural Revolution purges of alleged `` capitalist roaders'' within the party, <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> was a repeated victim. After criticizing <PERSON> Mao </PERSON>'s forced communization of agriculture and proposing material incentives to workers, he was purged in 1967 and sent to do factory and farm labor. He was recalled as vice premier in 1973 but ousted again in 1976 for allegedly causing protests against the radical leaders of the Cultural Revolution, nicknamed the `` Gang of Four.'' His absence was short-lived: he returned to office the following July. By then, <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> had died and the `` Gang of Four,'' including <PERSON> Mao </PERSON>'s widow, <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON> <PERSON> Qing </PERSON>, had been arrested. <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> consolidated his position as top leader in December 1978 and immediately began to implement the economic programs that had caused his downfall in the 1960s. The communes were gradually dismantled, and workers were given bonuses for extra production. Foreign investors and traders were welcomed and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s economy began a 10-year boom that saw skyscrapers rise in main cities, private factories spring up throughout the countryside and consumer fever sweep both rural and urban areas. But <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> was never a liberal in the Western sense. He referred to many of the Western cultural influences that invaded <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> cities along with Western investment as flies that come in an open window. He did not favor closing the window, but recommended installing a screen. In 1979, he cracked down harshly on the Democracy Wall movement, during which hundreds of students and workers put up big-character posters calling for democracy on a wall in central <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. Several leading Democracy Wall activists, including <PERSON> Wei </PERSON> <PERSON> Jingsheng </PERSON>, remain in prison, reportedly in poor physical and mental health. <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> has ignored recent calls by leading Chinese intellectuals for their release. In 1987, after a wave of national student protests, <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> allowed party conservatives to force the ouster of relatively liberal party General Secretary <PERSON> Hu </PERSON> <PERSON> Yaobang </PERSON>. A campaign was started against liberal thought in which several famous intellectuals lost their jobs or party memberships. Hu, like <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON>, had been a protege of <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>. In the months leading up to the latest student protests, more and more scholars clamored for political freedoms to match the new economic freedoms. In his last public statements before being ousted, <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> affirmed their position. <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> made it clear this wo n't be possible as long as he is in charge.

<TEXT>
 The trimaran Great American sailed through the Golden Gate today, snapping a 3-month-old New York-to-San Francisco sailing record by three days after an exhausting 77-day, 14,500-mile voyage. Latvian-born skipper <PERSON> Georgs </PERSON> <PERSON> Kolesnikovs </PERSON>, 46, of <LOCATION> Niagara </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, and crewman <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Pettengill </PERSON>, 37, <LOCATION> Newport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> R.I. </LOCATION>, received a raucous greeting from a fleet of boats which met the 60-foot, 12,000-pound vessel. `` We thought he was blown at the beginning,'' said <PERSON> Commodore </PERSON> <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Fortenbaugh </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Manhattan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yacht </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, which sponsored a trophy for the fastest trip. `` When we were seeing him off in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, his was the slowest start.'' The Great American crossed the finish _ an imaginary line between <LOCATION> Alcatraz </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> and Pier 39 _ at 10:46 a.m., an hour short of 77 days after leaving <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> for the arduous journey around <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Horn </LOCATION>. Kolesnikovs and <PERSON> Pettengill </PERSON> broke the 80-day, 20-hour record set Feb. 12 by <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Luhrs </PERSON>' sloop, Thursday's Child. At stake at the start of the challenges _ the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> is the last in a series of boats that have tried for the mark this year _ was the 135-year-old record set by the American clipper, Flying Cloud, which took 89 days to complete the voyage in 1854. Frenchman <PERSON> Philippe </PERSON> <PERSON> Monnet </PERSON>'s trimaran <PERSON> Elle </PERSON> et <LOCATION> Vire </LOCATION> missed <PERSON> Luhrs </PERSON>' mark by nine hours after losing a week to repairs after a collision with an iceberg Also failing to better the mark was <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Liardet </PERSON>, who made the run with fiance <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Guen </PERSON> aboard the 50-foot trimaran Finisterre Bregtane. She did become the first woman to complete a bid for the mark. Poised to greet Great American's crew at the end of the $ 300,000 effort were the families of both men and <PERSON> Vern </PERSON> <PERSON> Vihlene </PERSON>, their shore contact. `` I am very nervous,'' said <PERSON> Kolesnikovs </PERSON>' 67-year-old mother, <LOCATION> Veta </LOCATION>. `` I was nervous for the whole trip. I light a candle for my son every night.'' `` The worst time came when they lost the headstay a week ago,'' added his father, Roman, 79. `` He could have lost the mast and the boat, but everything is alright now. My son can do anything.'' In addition to battling uncooperative winds, the two sailors had to contend with a broken water maker, which converts salt water to fresh water, and damage to the cable that supports the Great American's 75-foot mast. The cable broke loose from the deck May 18, but <PERSON> Pettingill </PERSON> was able to rig a makeshift chain link between the deck and the cable.

 <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON> wanted economic and political reform to go hand-in-hand, but conservatives were determined to keep their power and crush a student movement for democracy. Sources said Friday that Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> and the old guard won and <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> lost his post as head of the 47 million-member <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which had made him the most powerful man in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> after senior leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON>. They said <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON>, 69, was under house arrest, accused of encouraging student unrest by being conciliatory. Although <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> is <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON>'s mentor in economic reforms, the two differ on political reform. <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON>'s sympathy for the students apparently was unacceptable. Just two years ago, <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> dismissed another party chief for being too sympathetic to pro-democracy students. <PERSON> Hu </PERSON> <PERSON> Yaobang </PERSON> was forced to resign in January 1987 after accusations that he was soft on students seeking a freer <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. Hu's death April 15 inspired the current student movement, which has a far grander scale. <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> had been premier for seven years when he took over the party in November 1987. He also was appointed first vice chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, of which <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> is chairman. He became the target of criticism a year ago when the government, faced with annual inflation of more than more than 30 percent and panic buying as a result, began worrying that it had lost control of the economy. <PERSON> Li </PERSON> and other conservatives blamed the rapid pace of market-oriented reforms associated with <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON>. They imposed a two-year austerity program and postponed more reform. This spring, the renewed student unrest made <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON>'s position even more tenuous. While tens of thousands of students occupied <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> earlier this month, he told President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> political and economic reform should proceed together and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> should enjoy `` genuine democracy'' under the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. He later expressed sympathy with the students demanding democratic reforms and advocated negotiations to end the crisis. He met with them in Tiananmen Square before martial law was imposed. <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> has permitted only token political liberalization and was said to have given the order a week ago for martial law to be declared in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> has been a role model for the new-style <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> leader. He is suave and articulate, at ease in both the communist world and the West. He wears immaculately tailored Western suits and regularly plays golf, a sport once condemned in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> as a bourgeois luxury. He was born in October 1919 to a landowning family in central <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Henan </LOCATION> province, joined the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in 1938 and led its committee in his native county during most of the 1937-45 war with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. Unlike the previous generation of party leaders, he did not make the Long March, the 7,700-mile trek northwest in 1934-35 to escape the Nationalist government troops in eastern <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. After the communist victory in 1949, <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> served in regional government and party posts. He was purged during the radical Cultural Revolution of 1966-76, as was <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>, but was rehabilitated long before it ended. <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> gained national prominence as party secretary and governor of <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>'s home province, <LOCATION> Sichuan </LOCATION>, where he carried out the senior leader's policies of dismantling farm communes and allowing private plots and bonuses for extra work.

<TEXT>
 The U.N. Environment Program chief said Friday he expects to have an international treaty to control climatic changes ready for signing in three years. Executive director <PERSON> Mustafa </PERSON> <PERSON> Tolba </PERSON> said the decision to negotiate a treaty with governments as soon as possible was taken at the 15th annual conference of the program's governing council, which ended Friday. Other resolutions include increasing <ORGANIZATION> UNEP </ORGANIZATION>'s annual budget from $ 40 million to $ 100 million by raising member nation's voluntary contributions by 31 percent in 1990 and 1991. Delegates from 103 countries, including 44 Cabinet ministers, attended the 12-day conference at <ORGANIZATION> UNEP </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> Nairobi </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Tolba </PERSON> said delegates were alarmed by `` changing weather patterns and increasing health risks caused by global warming.'' He said his organization would draft the treaty in consultation with the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Meteorological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. `` We are going to renegotiate the famous <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> protocol,'' <PERSON> Tolba </PERSON> said. `` Its renegotiation will be more difficult than negotiating it in the first place,'' he said of the non-binding agreement requiring governments to reduce production of chlorofluorocarbons, a coolant used in refrigerators and air conditioners that helps deplete the ozone layer. Scientists say the depletion allows the sun's harmful ultraviolet rays to penetrate the atmosphere and raises temperatures on earth, which causes the oceans to rise. <PERSON> Tolba </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> UNEP </ORGANIZATION> will collect scientific data on climatic changes and `` get scientists, at least a majority of them, to speak in one voice.'' He hoped a scientific report would be ready late next year. Then negotiations could begin, <PERSON> Tolba </PERSON> said. In negotiating the treaty, `` there would be plenty of issues, many stumbling blocks'' he said, because it will affect every nation's industry, agriculture, economy and forestry.

<HEAD>Consumer Spending Posts Best Performance in Nearly a Year</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>
<UNK>Associated Press Writer</UNK>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Consumer spending in April posted its best performance in nearly a year, rising 1.1 percent, the government said Friday in a report that analysts said shows the economy remains healthy even as growth slows. Meantime, the government reported a sharp improvement in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit in the opening quarter of the year as exports jumped 5.7 percent. While consumer spending rose at its fastest pace since a 1.3 percent increase last June, much of the growth was attributed to a sharp increase in auto sales because of rebates, low-interest loans and other industry incentives to move cars off dealers' lots. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> also reported that personal income rose a weak 0.4 percent last month compared with hikes of 0.8 percent in March and 1 percent in February. The April figure was the smallest increase since last November's 0.2 percent. But analysts blamed the sluggish income growth in April on lower farm subsidies over the past two months and a fallback from higher auto industry bonuses and retroactive Social Security payments in March. Discounting the auto sales and one-time weakness in incomes, `` what you come out with is reasonably decent income and consumption growth which tends to make the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s soft-landing scenario look more realistic,'' said analyst <PERSON> Cynthia </PERSON> <PERSON> Latta </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> credit-tightening designed to stem inflation has caused some economists to worry that resulting higher interest rates could move the economy into a recession, rather than the targeted soft landing. But recent reports continue to point to an economic slowdown without recession. And Friday's income and spending report tells the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> `` that so far, so good; that there's no reason to change what they're doing because it does n't yet look like they're guilty of overkill,'' Ms. <PERSON> Latta </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaber </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> agreed, saying, `` This certainly does n't suggest that the economy is collapsing by any means.'' But Ms. <PERSON> Shaber </PERSON> said consumer spending, which recorded increases of only 0.3 percent in March and 0.4 percent in Feburary, `` has been kind of sluggish'' because of `` higher interest rates and an erosion of consumer confidence.'' On trade, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the 5.7 percent jump in exports boosted <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> overseas sales to a record $ 88.5 billion during January, February and March. The department said the quarterly deficit was $ 27.6 billion, the smallest such imbalance in four years, compared with $ 32.02 billion in the last quarter of 1988. That was a drop of 13.7 percent. The department's merchandise trade report, calculated on a balance of payments basis, also registered a record $ 116.13 billion in imports, but the 0.3 percent increase was smaller than the pace of export expansion. In the other report, <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> said personal income increased by $ 17.7 billion to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $ 4.37 trillion in April, while consumer spending rose $ 35.9 billion to an adjusted annual $ 3.42 trillion rate. Consumer spending represents about two-thirds of overall economic activity. The consumer spending figure includes a 3.2 percent increase in durable goods _ big ticket items such as cars expected to last three years or more _ to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $ 467.1 billion. Durable spending fell the previous two months when auto sales were weak. Non-durable goods purchases rose 0.7 percent and spending on services was up 0.8 percent in April. The change in disposable income _ income after taxes _ registered a flat zero last month, down from March's 0.8 percent increase. Higher-than-usual federal income tax payments in April because of 1986 changes in tax law resulted in much of the decline. The personal savings rate suffered from the increase in tax payments, falling to 5.3 percent from a three-year high of 6.3 percent in March. Wages and salaries rose 0.6 percent to $ 2.61 trillion at a seasonally adjusted annual rate.

 Several hundred Soviets defied a ban on unauthorized meetings Friday and gathered in a downtown square to criticize their new parliament hours after it defeated reformers' attempts to sanction their gathering Police with megaphones urged the crowd to disperse or go to an approved meeting place in a giant parking lot away from the city center, but only a handful showed up at the officially approved meeting place. Authorities took no immediate action to break up the gathering in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Pushkin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>, a frequent gathering spot for political discussions and protests. `` The apparatus is still controlling everything,'' said one man who identified himself only as a taxi driver as he discussed the action at the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION>. `` Everything is the same as always.'' `` You can compare the congress to an old cake,'' chimed in another. `` They sprinkle some chocolate on the top, some democracy, but at the bottom it's stale.'' `` The only victory was that they managed to have some discussion,'' said <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Khatov </PERSON> in a typical comment about reformers at the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION> convened Thursday. A anonymous leaflet distributed in the square said, `` A few deputies truly elected by the people are trying to defend what has been promised ... but everything is being done according to a previously worked out scenario, just as it always was. `` What are we, the people, doing at this moment, which could become the turning point in our history of slavery? We, the people, are doing what we've been doing since 1917. We're looking for food _ and now soap as well.'' Friday's meeting followed police action to break up a similar gathering called late Thursday by the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, a self-styled opposition group. The use of special anti-riot forces to disperse the crowd triggered a heated quarrel Friday in the congress, where prominent reformer <PERSON> Tatyana </PERSON> <PERSON> Zaslavskaya </PERSON> urged the parliament to ask <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> city authorities to lift their ban on unsanctioned political meetings for the duration of the session. At the direction of President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, who chaired the televised proceedings, Interior Minister <PERSON> Vadim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakatin </PERSON> said meetings discussing actions at the congress had taken place without incident across the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> meeting was different, he said, because it had been banned in advance by the authorities. The top police official's statement touched off a furor on the congress floor. Some deputies shouted at one another, while others, from conservative <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, applauded to drown out speeches by liberal <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> deputies <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> <PERSON> Stankevich </PERSON> and <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>. <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>, 68, said that despite exhaustion from 13 hours of congress proceedings Thursday, he went to the square after being called at home by a weeping girl. He urged his fellow deputies to meet with the young activists after each day of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> debate. `` We must not surround these people with police units,'' he said, recalling events in the <LOCATION> Georgian </LOCATION> capital of <LOCATION> Tbilisi </LOCATION> last month, where at least 20 people died after security forces moved against a pro-independence protest. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> stopped the debate by putting <PERSON> Zaslavskaya </PERSON>'s call to a vote. Her proposal was defeated, with 831 deputies supporting her, 1,261 against and 30 abstaining. Before the results were announced, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said he had received word from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> Communist Party boss <PERSON> Lev </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Zaikov </PERSON> that city authorities would sanction a voters' meeting in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> _ but in the stadium parking lot well away from Pushkin Square.

 Suppliers promised plenty of gasoline for local drivers and the thousands of tourists expected over the holiday weekend, despite the loss of a pipeline providing 90 percent of the city's supply. But industry officials warned that the situation could change if motorists succumbed to panic buying in the wake of Thursday's pipeline explosion in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bernardino </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION> `` The people of this town need to be responsible enough to not go crazy, and not alter their purchasing habits,'' said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Greco </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Nevada </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gasoline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Retailers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> Reserves were being trucked into southern <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> refineries 300 miles away, officials said. The gasoline supply was disrupted by the blast at <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bernardino </LOCATION> knocked out the Calnev underground pipeline, the chief conduit for gasoline and diesel fuel for the <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>. The explosion, which killed at least three people and shut the pipeline indefinitely, was in the same place that a freight train derailed two weeks ago and plowed into nearby houses, killing four. Inspectors checked the pipeline after that accident and believed that it had not been damaged. <PERSON> Holly </PERSON> <PERSON> Rea </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for <ORGANIZATION> GATX </ORGANIZATION>, the Chicago-based company that owns the pipeline, said there were six days worth of gasoline and a two-day supply of diesel fuel stored in tanks in <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>. A spot check of some of the city's busiest stations revealed no run on the pumps as of Friday morning. `` There are no long lines or anything like that,'' said <PERSON> P.J </PERSON>. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, an employee at a <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> station at a busy intersection on the city's east side. `` There's no big rush. Business is just normal, I guess.'' The concern over the pipeline disruption was heightened by the fact that more than 100,000 visitors were expected here for the three-day Memorial Day weekend, one of the busiest of the year in <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>. Nearly half of them were expected to come by car. Trucking fuel to southern <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> will be more expensive but oil company officials said that does n't necessarily mean a rise in prices at the pump. `` It will certainly increase our costs, but we'll absorb that because we want to stay competitive,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Libbey </PERSON>.

<HEAD>First Quarter Trade Deficit Lowest in Four Years</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Economy Bjt</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> enjoyed its best trading performance in four years from January through March as the deficit fell 13.7 percent to $ 27.63 billion, the government reported Friday. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said that a decline in non-oil imports and the highest level of farm exports in almost eight years helped to lower the deficit from the fourth quarter level of $ 32.02 billion. Propelled by the higher farm sales, exports jumped 5.7 percent in the first quarter to a new record of $ 88.50 billion. Imports hit an all-time high as well of $ 116.13 billion, but the 0.3 percent increase was much smaller than the pace of export expansion. Friday's report on merchandise trade as calculated on a balance of payments basis confirmed an improvement already noted in the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s monthly merchandise trade reports. The totals are slightly different because the new report excludes military sales by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government to foreign governments and makes other minor adjustments to the monthly figures. While the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration and some analysts are looking for the first quarter trade improvement to continue, other private economists expressed fears that deficit will begin widening in coming months. They are particularly worried about the strength in the dollar, which makes American products more expensive on overseas markets, and rising oil prices, which boost the country's foreign oil bill. <PERSON> Cynthia </PERSON> <PERSON> Latta </PERSON>, an economist with <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, predicted that the trade deficit for the entire year will be essentially unchanged from the $ 127.22 billion deficit in 1988. `` While agricultural sales were up sharply in the first quarter, that sector is really threatened by the strength in the dollar because there are so many other countries willing to supply the products if the American price becomes uncompetitive,'' she said. But <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinai </PERSON>, chief economist of the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said he was more optimistic that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit would continue narrowing this year, helped out by faster growth overseas and slower <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> growth, which would cut the demand for imports. `` So long as the economies of the world stay strong, there is every reason to believe that our exports will keep doing well,'' he said. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration, which has staked its economic forecast on a belief exports will keep climbing, is trying to help the process along with aggressive efforts to open foreign markets. The administration on Thursday announced that it was threatening <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> with special tariffs in an effort to reduce barriers blocking the sale of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> products in those countries. The big jump in exports in the first quarter reflected an 11.2 percent surge in sales of American farm products, which climbed to $ 10.88 billion, the highest level since the second quarter of 1981. Sales of manufactured goods and other items in the non-farm category were up by $ 3.67 billion to $ 77.61 billion, reflecting strength in sales of industrial supplies, aircraft and consumer goods. The rise in imports came entirely from an increase in petroleum imports, which shot up 17.5 percent to $ 10.83 billion, with the advance coming from the higher cost of oil. Non-petroleum imports declined by $ 1.23 billion to $ 105.30 billion, reflecting a drop in demand for consumer goods and autos. The improved trade performance put the quarterly deficit at the lowest level since a $ 25.7 billion imbalance in the first quarter of 1985. The deficit with the countries of <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> fell to $ 1.02 billion, the lowest level in almost six years. As usual, the largest deficit was with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, an imbalance of $ 13.16 billion, down 14.5 percent from the fourth quarter.

 A gasoline pipeline exploded and killed three people just days after residents were assured it had not been damaged by a runaway train that plowed through the same neighborhood two weeks ago. `` It looks like a bomb went off over <LOCATION> Duffy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION>,'' City Attorney <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Penman </PERSON> said after the Thursday morning blast that sent flames 300 feet skyward and produced heat so intense that pets and corn stalks were singed two blocks away. Thirty-one people were injured in the explosion that also destroyed 10 homes and 18 cars. About 300 people were ordered to leave their homes for the night, and the pipeline break cut off <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>' chief source of gasoline and diesel fuel. Up to seven people were unaccounted-for after the blast, but by midmorning today authorities said all but one had been located. `` It's like a nightmare,'' said <PERSON> Delores </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, whose house was destroyed by the fire. `` I have n't slept since the train wreck. It's come back to haunt me.'' The May 12 train wreck leveled a row of homes and killed four people. <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> personnel gathered here today to investigate the explosion, and <ORGANIZATION> Calnev </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pipeline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> manager <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Seal </PERSON> said there was a `` very good possibility'' the company's 14-inch pipeline was damaged by the train accident The city and an attorney for more than 100 residents announced plans to file lawsuits against the <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> company. The residents also plan to sue the city and the rail line, <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>. `` We did not feel in the first place they should have started up that railroad as quickly as they did. And we particularly tried to get the pipeline shut down. Now look what happened,'' said residents' attorney <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, who was hired after the train wreck. The neighborhood was evacuated for several days after the train jumped the track because of fears the pipeline might have been weakened. The city was assured the line was safe when it reopened several days ago, <PERSON> Penman </PERSON> said. The body of a woman killed in the blast was found in the back yard of a home, pinned to a chain-link fence. The other two fatalities, an adult and child, were found next door. `` A woman said she ran out of her house, she left behind her sister, her cousin and a 6-month-old baby inside, and she looked back, and the house blew up behind her,'' said Councilwoman <PERSON> Valerie </PERSON> <PERSON> Pope-Ludlam </PERSON>. Just before the blast, a fountain of gasoline spouted above ground, said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Allaire </PERSON>, a city information officer. `` It was up in the air _ high pressure _ like a geyser,'' he said. The pipeline carries gasoline, diesel and jet fuel from a tank farm in <LOCATION> Colton </LOCATION>, several miles from the blaze site, to southern <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>, supplying the <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> with 90 percent of its fuel. It was buried 6 feet deep near the spot where the train derailed. On the eve of the Memorial Day weekend, <PERSON> Las </PERSON> <PERSON> Vegas </PERSON> was left with less than a week's supply of gasoline and only a couple of days worth of diesel fuel. Gas was being trucked into the city, and spot checks this morning showed no immediate signs of panic-buying by motorists. <PERSON> P.J </PERSON>. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, a worker at a <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> station at a busy intersection on <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>' east side, said pumps were `` a little busier, but there are no lines or anything like that. There's really no big rush. Once the explosion occurred, the flow of fuel through the pipeline was shut off, said <PERSON> Jed </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Calnev </PERSON>'s general manager in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bernardino </LOCATION>. But fuel remaining in the shattered pipe continued to burn fiercely through much of the day. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said up to 12,000 gallons of gasoline burned. Residents have complained recently that train wheels throw off sparks as they pass and that railroad crews have to walk alongside afterward and douse small fires. A freight train passed over the tracks 10 minutes before the explosion, said <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Taggart </PERSON>. There was no immediate evidence, however, that sparks from the passing train triggered the blast.

 A federal judge on Friday moved back the starting date of the Iran-Contra trial of a former <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> agent to July 24. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Hilton </PERSON> granted the two-week delay after lawyers for <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> said the government's case has been tainted with testimony given under immunity from prosecution. <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>'s former station chief in <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, is accused of covering up his ties to <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s secret Contra resupply operation. The network operated during a congressional ban on military aid to the Nicaraguan rebel force. <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> is accused of obstructing and making false statements to the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>'s inspector general and the presidentially appointed <ORGANIZATION> Tower </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> early in 1987. At a court hearing, <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON>'s lawyer <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said that <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> <PERSON> Black </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>'s inspector general office had informed the prosecution that he had read <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON>'s immunized congressional testimony detailing many of the activities for which he is now accused of crimes. <PERSON> Black </PERSON> told the prosecution `` he would be unable to ferret out immunized testimony from non-immunized testimony,'' <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said. Black was interviewed for three hours by the office of independent counsel <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> and testified before a grand jury for two hours. Prosecutor <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Longstreth </PERSON> disputed <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>'s assertion, saying <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> had been able to come up with just a single example of Black's testimony possibly being tainted. `` We think <PERSON> Black </PERSON>'s testimony is clean,'' said <PERSON> Longstreth </PERSON>. Under a <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling, the government may not make any use of a person's immunized testimony in building a case against him. Another <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> employee, <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Dupart </PERSON>, compliance officer for the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>, `` steeped himself in immunized testimony,'' which he used to brief his superiors who also faced questioning in the Iran-Contra affair, said <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>. The lawyer said the government interviewed Dupart 12 times. <PERSON> Hilton </PERSON> said he might require the prosecution to demonstrate more conclusively that its case was n't tainted by immunized testimony. The judge set aside July 10 to hear any motions concerning the use of classified information, the use of immunized testimony or other matters. <PERSON> Hilton </PERSON> also directed the prosecution to turn over to <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> for use in his defense a deposition of <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> <PERSON> Tambs </PERSON>, a former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>. One of the charges is that <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> falsely told the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> inspector general that an airstrip in <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> built by the North network was initiated by the Costa Rican government. Prosecutor <PERSON> Laurence </PERSON> <PERSON> Shtasel </PERSON> said <PERSON> Tambs </PERSON>' deposition shows only `` why they -LRB- Costa Rican officials -RRB- agreed to it subsequently.''

<TEXT>
 A settlement has been reached in a lawsuit against <PERSON> Dustin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> and three other defendants that stemmed from the accidental drowning of a woman on the actor's estate in 1986 <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> will pay nothing to the estate of <PERSON> Sheila </PERSON> <PERSON> Cruse </PERSON> <PERSON> Fionda </PERSON> under the settlement reached Thursday. `` The amount will not be disclosed but the settlement does not involve any money from Mr. <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON>,'' said Superior Judge <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickett </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> after attorneys presented him with the agreement less than an hour before trial was to begin. The lawsuit, filed by <PERSON> Fionda </PERSON>'s former husband on behalf of their son, concerned claims of wrongful death and negligence in <LOCATION> Fionda </LOCATION>'s Aug. 24, 1986, drowning <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> was not at the estate at the time. <PERSON> Fionda </PERSON>, 43, a teacher, was found floating face down about 6 a.m. in the hot tub portion of a swimming pool on <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Roxbury </LOCATION> estate. An autopsy showed her blood-alcohol count was three times the legal limit for drunken driving in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Fionda </PERSON> had gone out to dinner with <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON>'s former caretaker, <PERSON> Albion </PERSON> <PERSON> Dudley </PERSON>. A court document says <PERSON> Fionda </PERSON> was awake at 4 a.m. in the caretaker's apartment and asked <PERSON> Dudley </PERSON> to go swimming. When he declined, she went alone, the lawsuit said. In addition to <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dudley </PERSON>, the lawsuit also named the tub installer and the company that made the tub's heating element. The lawsuit did not specify damages sought, but <PERSON> Fionda </PERSON>'s attorney said last year the family would settle for $ 200,000.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> said Friday that lack of funds is forcing it to curtail medical services. <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Derwinski </PERSON> announced a freeze, except in emergencies, on accepting new patients with non-service-connected ailments whose incomes are above certain limits. Rep. <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> `` </PERSON> <PERSON> Sonny </PERSON><PERSON> '' </PERSON> <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON>, D-Miss., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Veterans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said the new limit essentially would exclude such veterans with incomes greater than $ 16,476 `` This is just sad, that the veteran again is caught in the squeeze play of politics,'' said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sherwood </PERSON>, director for health policy and planning at the Vietnam Veterans of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. `` There is no question that this will affect a large number of veterans,'' said <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Holt </PERSON>, executive director of the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> office of the Veterans of Foreign Wars. The <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> also announced that vacant staff positions at VA facilities will not be filled, the agency will stop spending for the maintenance and purchase of certain equipment and the start-up of several projects will be delayed. `` I must take these actions to keep the system functioning within the limits of our resources,'' said <PERSON> Derwinski </PERSON>. He said the cuts should allow the agency to contunue operating at a reduced level until June 15. By then, he said, he hopes <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will have resolved an impasse that has prevented approval of a supplemental funding bill for the department. If that does not occur, said <PERSON> Derwinski </PERSON>, more drastic cuts may be needed. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> passed a supplemental appropriation bill last week including $ 340 million to continue operations of <ORGANIZATION> VA </ORGANIZATION> health care facilities through the remainder of the fiscal year. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, however, passed a measure including money only through June 15. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> balked at that limit and the dispute remains unresolved. `` These folks just ca n't get together to do what is best for the veterans that we are supposed to be serving,'' said <PERSON> Sherwood </PERSON>.. `` Some vets have no choice but to rely on the VA'' for medical care, he said <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON> said some alcohol and drug treatment service have already been cut back and that nursing home and hospital beds will have to be closed for lack of staff.

 A surgeon saved the life of a gunshot victim by plugging the bullet holes in his heart with her fingers and massaging the organ to keep it beating during a 14-minute helicopter ride to a trauma center. Dr. <PERSON> Wendy </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> cradled the exposed heart in her hands and kept the patient from bleeding to death while she supervised his transfer Thursday from a <LOCATION> Joliet </LOCATION> hospital to a suburban trauma center equipped for open-heart surgery. Surgeons there repaired the holes, and the patient, <PERSON> Tommy </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> `` Tony'' <PERSON> Hairston </PERSON>, was doing well Friday, said Ms. <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>, director of <ORGANIZATION> Loyola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>'s trauma unit and its air medical service. `` We were lucky,'' she said in an interview from suburban <LOCATION> Maywood </LOCATION> a day after the feat, which the hospital's chairman of surgery, Dr. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Freeark </PERSON>, called unprecedented and heroic. `` It's one for the books, that's for sure,'' said Dr. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrett </PERSON>, director of the area's busiest trauma unit at <ORGANIZATION> Cook </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> said the good judgment of surgeons at <ORGANIZATION> Silver </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Joliet </LOCATION> to call for help before it was too late, coupled with the efficiency of her medical support staff, made the dramatic transfer possible. `` It's a team effort,'' she said. `` That's the success of the system.'' The team was lucky because a major storm system cleared the area just two hours before Ms. <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> was summoned at 5 a.m. `` If the storms had still been going on, we would not have been able to fly,'' she said. She said the patient likely would not have survived transfer by ambulance. <LOCATION> Joliet </LOCATION> is about 25 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Maywood </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hairston </PERSON>, 29, a <LOCATION> Joliet </LOCATION> landscaper, was shot Wednesday night after an argument with a neighbor over missing property, police said. The neighbor, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Knox </PERSON>, was charged with attempted murder, armed violence and unlawful use of a weapon, police said. <PERSON> Hairston </PERSON> was rushed to <ORGANIZATION> Silver </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>, where an operation was performed. However, after surgery, he started bleeding again. A second operation revealed the bullet wounds in the heart, which could not be repaired without a heart-bypass machine, which Silver Cross lacks. Surgeons called for help and Ms. <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> arrived 23 minutes later. <PERSON> Freeark </PERSON> said it's not unusual for a trauma surgeon to use fingers to block holes in the heart, but `` that usually takes place in an emergency room, until you can get the patient to the operating room.'' `` To my knowledge, no one has ever transferred a patient by any means _ ambulance or certainly helicopter _ from one hospital to another while a surgeon had a finger occluding a hole in the heart,'' <PERSON> Freeark </PERSON> said. He added that few surgeons would have thought to try the transfer, and without it, `` no question the patient would have died.'' Adding to the difficulty was the fact that <PERSON> Hairston </PERSON>'s heart stopped beating three times, for a total of eight minutes, during the trip, requiring Ms. <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> to massage the organ between her hands _ while keeping her fingers in the holes _ to stimulate it to pump again. `` It would have been very easy to get discouraged with the whole thing anywhere along the way,'' <PERSON> Freeark </PERSON> said. `` But that's Dr. <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>. She does n't quit.''

 It took a college auditorium to hold all the people who wanted to testify or sit in on a presentence hearing for four teen-age vandals who damaged a high school so badly it is still closed two months later. `` The first thing that crosses your mind is lock them up for 10 years,'' <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Thul </PERSON>, a high school parent testified at the Thursday night hearing attended by more than 300 people. But after reflecting, <PERSON> Thul </PERSON> said, `` What I would like to see is harsh punishment in community service.'' Other parents, along with teachers, classmates and taxpayers, recommended community service, counseling, restitution, even some jail time for that damage that ranges upwards of $ 6 million. But none recommended extended prison sentences. One student handed in a petition he said was signed by 285 people urging that the four defendants not be sent to prison. `` I expected in some ways tonight to have a vigilante atmosphere,'' said parent <PERSON> Aethan </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>, who expressed relief at what he called a `` thoughtful process.'' Many of the approximately 30 people who testified at <ORGANIZATION> Inver </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hills </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> expressed sympathy for the teen-agers' families and pleaded with the judges to impose sentences that allow for rehabilitation. But they also expressed anger and frustration over students' projects that were destroyed and the disruption it caused The 1,220-student <ORGANIZATION> Henry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sibley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paul </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Mendota </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heights </LOCATION> has been closed since the March 23 damage. The vandals destroyed student projects and teaching equipment and turned on fire hoses that soaked asbestos, contaminating air in the building. <PERSON> Sibley </PERSON> students are attending another school during the repair and cleanup. All four defendants, three of them 18 years old and one 17, have pleaded guilty to felony first-degree criminal dmage to property, third-degree burglary and theft. On June 12, <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Lacy </PERSON> is to sentence <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> <PERSON> Lasch </PERSON> and the juvenile, while District Judge <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Thuet </PERSON> is to sentence <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Easton </PERSON> and <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> <PERSON> Klein </PERSON>. All four attended the presentence hearing, but said nothing. <PERSON> Lasch </PERSON> was the only one who was n't a student at <LOCATION> Sibley </LOCATION> at the time of the vandalism and <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> was the only one unable to make his $ 25,000 bail. He has been in jail since the end of March. State law requires the state <ORGANIZATION> Corrections </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to get from crime victims a statement of the damage they suffered and their opinions on sentencing. Because of the unusually large number of victims in this case, the judges decided to hold the hearing in the auditorium. <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Backstrom </PERSON> has said the case justifies an upward departure from the sentencing guidelines, which call for no more than a year in the county jail and 10 years of probation for the 18-year-olds. The juvenile can not be sentenced to community service or a juvenile institution past his 19th birthday, which is 13 months from now.

The chicks are the first peregrine falcons to hatch in western <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> in more than 40 years.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, whose title of president was largely ceremonial window dressing, now has new power and perhaps new accountability to go with his old title. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> assumed a more powerful presidency on Thursday after winning more than 95 percent of the votes from the new <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION>. The new position replaces the largely ceremonial presidency he held previously as the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s official head of state. The new presidency entitles <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to serve as head of the nation's supreme military body, the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>; to negotiate and sign treaties; and to draft decrees and orders. However, constitutional amendments passed in November mean that the new president will be subject _ on paper at least _ to control by a new, full-time legislature, the Supreme Soviet. That new body, composed of 542 people chosen from the 2,250-seat <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, will have extensive powers to oversee Soviet economic, financial, social, foreign affairs and defense policy. A bicameral body that is intended to hold two annual sessions of about four months each, the Supreme Soviet also will be empowered to schedule nationwide elections, appoint the premier, elect the top national court and endorse senior prosecutors. After heated debate in the old <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> parliament last fall, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> agreed that the Supreme Soviet also would have the right to repeal presidential decrees. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, as <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief, holds ultimate power. But as president, he can be recalled by the congress, which will elect presidents once every five years. There is a two-term limit on one person holding the office. Many of the powers now vested in the president, the Supreme Soviet and the directly elected congress rested formally in the past with the parliament and the chairman of its executive Presidium, who came to be known as the president. In practice, however, as writer <PERSON> Chingiz </PERSON> <PERSON> Aitmatov </PERSON> noted in a speech nominating <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> for the new presidency on Thursday, the Supreme Soviet parliament was `` under strong pressure from authoritarian regimes'' and legislators passed laws in ritual votes `` as if in a theater.'' For decades, real power rested with the head of the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, and his fellow members of the top party body, the Politburo. The old-style presidency acquired prominence only with the ascent of <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>, who held the ceremonial post from 1960 to June 1964. Months later, <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> was chosen as the compromise candidate of rival Politburo factions battling to oust <PERSON> Nikita </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON> from the Kremlin. <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> did not resume the ceremonial title of president again until June 1977, following the ouster of <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Podgorny </PERSON> from the post. After <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>'s death in June 1982, his successor as party chief, <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Andropov </PERSON>, assumed the post, as did <PERSON> Konstantin </PERSON> <PERSON> U. </PERSON> <PERSON> Chernenko </PERSON> after him. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, named <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader in March 1985, at first put veteran Foreign Minister <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gromyko </PERSON> into the presidency in the summer of 1985, and took the post himself only in October when <PERSON> Gromyko </PERSON> retired from politics. The ceremonial nature of the past presidency led <ORGANIZATION> congress </ORGANIZATION> deputy <PERSON> Konstantin </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lubenchenko </PERSON> to proclaim Thursday during debate on <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s candidacy that `` we do n't have a president of the country'' and are only just beginning to create one. Several speakers in Thursday's debate, mindful of past autocracy, expressed doubts about uniting the powers of Soviet president and <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief in one man. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> pledged not to repeat the abuses of the past. But it will be up to the new parliament to hold him to his promise.

<HEAD>Grand Jury Refuses to Indict Mother for Manslaughter</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROCKFORD, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A grand jury refused to indict a young mother for manslaughter in the prenatal, cocaine-linked death of her 2-day-old daughter, authorities said Friday. The case of <PERSON> Melanie </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON>, 24, sparked heated debate over the merits of such prosecution after <ORGANIZATION> Winnebago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>'s Attorney <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Logli </PERSON> charged her May 9 with involuntary manslaughter and delivery during pregancy of a controlled substance to a minor. The move drew fire from some members of the medical, social service and legal communities, who argued fear of prosecution could prevent drug-abusing mothers-to-be from seeking medical help. `` This office brought the charges and sought the indictment because we believed at that time and still do believe that it was an appropriate response to the death of a newborn child,'' <PERSON> Logli </PERSON> said Friday at a news conference. `` There are no winners in a case like this,'' said <LOCATION> Winnebago </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Public Defender <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Pumilia </PERSON>, who accompanied Ms. <PERSON> Green </PERSON> to Thursday's grand jury proceeding. `` A case like this gets a lot of publicity, but the battle in the trenches is being fought in juvenile court,'' in child-abuse and custody cases involving suspected prenatal drug abuse, he said. Ms. <PERSON> Green </PERSON>'s daughter, <PERSON> Bianca </PERSON>, was 2 days old when she died Feb. 4 of oxygen deprivation attributed to her mother's alleged cocaine use during pregnancy. Prenatal exposure to the drug can cause numerous health problems, including low birth weight, impaired motor ability, irritability that can hinder learning, strokes and seizures. Ms. <PERSON> Green </PERSON>, who does not have a telephone, could not be reached immediately for comment on the grand jury action. She had said earlier, `` I loved her, I did.'' She refused to discuss her alleged drug use, but said authorities `` should help people. I tried to get help but I could n't get any.'' <PERSON> Logli </PERSON> called for state legislation `` to address the very pressing issues brought on by this prosecution,'' citing the need to protect infants, eliminate drug abuse among pregnant women and provide for criminal prosecution in the event of injury. While charges related to the baby's death have been dropped, prosecutors have not decided whether to pursue drug-abuse charges against Ms. <PERSON> Green </PERSON>, <PERSON> Logli </PERSON> said, adding he also was concerned about the welfare of her son, a first-grader. Attorney <PERSON> Colleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Connell </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, which was representing Ms. <PERSON> Green </PERSON>, had said most drug rehabilitation programs will not accept pregnant women. Cocaine was found in <PERSON> Bianca </PERSON>'s system and in her mother's, Dr. <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Seward </PERSON>, the county coroner, said. The drug was carried through the placenta to the fetus, reducing <PERSON> Bianca </PERSON>'s ability to accept oxygen from the mother and resulting in brain damage. <PERSON> Logli </PERSON> had characterized that process as delivery of a controlled substance to a minor.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> summit closed two days late Friday after adopting what <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> Foreign Minister <PERSON> Tariq </PERSON> <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON> called a `` gentleman's agreement'' for <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> to withdraw its troops from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Syrian intransigence prevented any resolution explicitly calling for the Syrian army to leave <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, the main <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> objective. Several times the <LOCATION> Syrian-Iraqi </LOCATION> confrontation almost led to the collapse of the summit. The Arab leaders appointed a three-member committee and gave it six months to supervise a cease-fire, reconvene <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, arrange the appointment of a president and amend the constitution for more balanced power-sharing between the warring Moslems and Christians The negotiators are <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION>'s King <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, King Fahd of <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>'s President <PERSON> Chadli </PERSON> <PERSON> Bendjedid </PERSON>. In <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, surprising support for the peace plan came from acting Prime Minister <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON>, the Moslem leader whose closest ally is <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>. `` I welcome the resolutions of the Arab summit and hope they will be implemented as soon as possible,'' <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON> said in a brief statement. His Christian opponent, Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, will not comment until after an emergency meeting Saturday of his rival <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s spokesman said But the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lebanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said the summit `` failed to offer anything more than lip service to help resolve the <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> crisis.'' `` The summit also has failed to devise a mechanism to monitor a cease-fire and made no reference to the role of the Syrian army in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>,'' it said. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> has insisted on a Syrian pullout as a precondition for a Moslem-Christian dialogue on political reforms to end the 14-year civil war. In <LOCATION> Casablanca </LOCATION>, the war of words between arch foes <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> caused chaotic scenes and almost led the summit to collapse. As a result, the meeting continued for four days, longer than any summit in the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>'s 44-year history, Moroccan television said. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON> told reporters that if <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> does not withdraw within six months, his government will demand another summit. The conference resolution `` fell short of what must be done on this important issue,'' <PERSON> Aziz </PERSON> said. But he added the leaders reached `` a gentleman's agreement for a pullout of Syrian troops,'' first from <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> then from other regions. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> has 40,000 troops in Moslem west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s eastern and northern provinces under a 1976 league peacekeeping mandate Secretary-General <PERSON> Chedli </PERSON> <PERSON> Klibi </PERSON> read the final communique closing the summit, called primarily to reinstate <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> in the 22-nation league after a 10-year suspension for making peace with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Delegates provided the text of other resolutions. The summit adopted a seven-point plan on <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> that stressed the country's unity, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> identity, territorial integrity and independence. It asserted the fate of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> is a `` general <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> responsibility,'' and called on all Lebanese factions to respect the much-fractured cease-fire called by the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> last April. <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON>'s committee was asked: _ To invite <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> legislators to a conference to prepare a political reform document that would form the basis for national reconciliation _ To get <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> to ratify the document _ To arrange for <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> to elect a president who would form a `` government of national reconciliation'' that would amend the constitution A new constitution likely would reflect the wishes of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s Moslem majority, shrinking the power of the minority Christians who traditionally have dominated Lebanese politics. _ To support the government in exercising full sovereignty over all Lebanese territory The last refers not only to Syrian troops, but also about 2,000 Iranian Revolutionary Guards in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> at <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s invitation and about 1,000 Israeli troops that patrol the self-designated security zone <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> carved out of southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> after its 1982-85 invasion. The summit communique condemned `` continued Israeli aggression against <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and its sovereignty.'' <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> leaders agreed to pay a $ 120 million lump sum and provide monthly payments of $ 43 million promised last year to support the Palestinian uprising in the Israeli-occupied territories. The <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> complained to the meeting that only <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> had paid up. It supported <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> opposition to an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> proposal for elections on the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> of Palestinians who would negotiate with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> for limited self-rule. The summit backed <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> demands that elections be held under international supervision `` within the framework of a comprehensive peace process, since the Israeli scheme aims at undermining the uprising and sidestepping the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> and the Palestinian people's inalienable national rights.

 The Singer Company has been barred from selling any of its assets or paying stock dividends pending a lawsuit over claims a former subsidiary defrauded the government. The company, named as a co-defendant in a civil suit against its former Link Flight Simulation Division, was also ordered not to incur any new debt or make any payments to investor <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Bilzerian </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> financier who acquired the company last year. The preliminary injunction, issued by a federal judge in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>, was sought by the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, which last March joined the $ 231 million lawsuit that had originally been filed by a former Link Flight pricing administrator. The complaint charges that the company cheated the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> out of $ 77 million by submitting false contract bid data on flight simulation equipment to train pilots. It seeks triple damages from Link Flight, which is now owned by <ORGANIZATION> CAE </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>FAA Denies Exception For Mandatory Pilot Retirement</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> denied Friday a petition from a group of older pilots to be allowed to fly airliners after age 60, saying older pilots are more likely to be involved in accidents. The agency announced, however, that it would fund a detailed study of pilot age and accident rates and indicated it might be willing to certify individual pilots over 60 if a way can be found to determine their capacities. `` What is needed and what the petitioners have failed to show,'' the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> said, `` is a way to discriminate between those who contribute to the adverse trend of increasing accidents -LRB- involving older pilots -RRB- and those who do not.'' The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> said it is willing to look at any scientific evidence that will help in setting criteria for selecting older pilots who have a low accident risk. The issue has simmered since the 1950s when the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> first ordered that airline pilots and co-pilots must retire at 60. It attracted renewed interest after Feb. 24 when 59-year-old <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> pilot <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Cronin </PERSON> guided a <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 to a safe landing in <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> after a section of its fuselage blew off, sending nine passengers to their deaths. <PERSON> Cronin </PERSON> was hailed as a hero for his second-to-last commercial flight before retirement. Pilots have for years been saying the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> rule needlessly discriminates on the bases of age. The latest denial came in a petition for exemption from the retirement rule filed by a group of pilots in May 1986. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> rejected it 16 months later. The pilots then went to court, and the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> required the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> to take another look at the petition. `` The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> has long contended that pilots past the age of 60 are more likely to suffer performance degradation and that there is no way to accurately predict its onset,'' the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> said. It said there is evidence that older pilots' skills deteriorate and statistics that show they are more likely to be involved in accidents. The agency noted that older pilots contend that their experience in the cockpit makes up for any problem associated with being over 60. But it said the evidence shows otherwise.

 After 13 years of protests and wrangling, <LOCATION> Seabrook </LOCATION> nuclear power plant officials got their testing license Friday and began laying plans to start their first atomic chain reaction, possibly within a week. The license, the biggest milestone yet for a project that is 10 years late and billions over budget, was granted by the <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> Friday morning. A federal appeals court declined to delay the tests late Thursday. The license does not settle disputes over evacuation planning for crowded beaches and coastal communities within 10 miles of <LOCATION> Seabrook </LOCATION> _ the key issue blocking commercial operation of the $ 6 billion reactor. <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON> officials hope to receive a commercial license in the fall, but <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and other plant foes promise to keep fighting _ to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> if necessary. But `` the fact is the low-power license means that all the technical issues have been resolved, and that's a very critical step,'' said the plant's top executive, <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>. Relief was palpable among officials at a project that has faced countless licensing and financial setbacks and years of high-visibility demonstrations. Inside the <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON> gates, a sign on the road leading to the power plant and posters inside the administration building proclaimed: `` License Received! A time for pride. A time for power.'' Beaming plant executives congratulated each other as they read copies of the freshly issued license. Before starting the testing, plant operators planned to spend a day or so reviewing voluminous technical specifications attached to the license. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Grillo </PERSON>, the plant's operations manager, said he expected no surprises. `` We know pretty much what's coming,'' <PERSON> Grillo </PERSON> said. `` We have n't been doing this in a vacuum We've been negotiating'' with the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> staff on technical issues. The testing process likely will start this weekend, plant officials said. Valves will be opened and water will be pumped through the reactor coolant system. Friction from the rapid circulation would heat the reactor from 150 degrees to its operating temperature of 557 degrees. After a five-day warmup, operators would set the stage for a nuclear chain reaction by withdrawing neutron-absorbing control rods from the reactor fuel core and reducing the amount of neutron-absorbing boron in the coolant water, eventually letting uranium atoms start fissioning. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> estimated the plant would achieve initial `` criticality'' _ its first self-sustained fission reaction _ within seven to 10 days. That could coincide with a rally and mass civil disobedience action planned months ago for next weekend by the <ORGANIZATION> Clamshell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>, which for 13 years has organized protests that have resulted in nearly 2,500 arrests and in the name <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON> becoming synonymous with anti-nuclear activism. `` Will we modify our schedule to tie into what the demonstrators are doing at any point in time?'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. `` The answer is no.'' Clamshell organizers, vowing non-violence, say protesters plan to try to climb fences surrounding the site but wo n't try to reach an inner fence around the plant itself. <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON>'s opponents argue that stopping the plant is crucial for the health and safety of tens of thousands of people who live nearby or crowd seacoast beaches as close as 1.7 miles from the reactor. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, president of <LOCATION> Seabrook </LOCATION> operator <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yankee </ORGANIZATION>, maintains that <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON> is `` the safest power plant that's ever been built'' and that evacuation plans for surrounding communities would protect the public in the unlikely event of an accident. Federal licensing board hearings on the plans are in progress. <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON> supporters say the 1,150-megawatt reactor is vitally needed to meet <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>'s burgeoning power demand. Nuclear industry officials worldwide also see <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON> as crucial to their hopes of fostering development of a new generation of reactors, <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> acknowledged. `` We're aware the rest of the industry is watching us, but we're not out there fighting the industry's battles,'' he said <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON> officials had fought nearly three years for the low-power license after the plant was completed in July, 1986.

<HEAD>Supplemental Housing Allowance Readjusted by Pentagon</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> announced Friday that it has readjusted a key supplemental housing allowance and more than 800,000 people in the military services will see a small increase in that part of their paycheck. The change in the variable housing allowance, set to begin June 1, will be the second increase this year. The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> declined to estimate the average increase on a percentage basis, saying all the geographic factors had n't been computed. But figures released by the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> suggest the increase will exceed this year's first hike of 3.4 percent, and will range from an average $ 4.80 a month extra for a private to $ 13.01 a month extra for a colonel. Military officials boosted the allowance in January, deliberately holding down the size of that hike to make sure the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> did n't exceed a congressional limit of $ 1.22 billion for the entire program. `` The <ORGANIZATION> VHA </ORGANIZATION> rate increase, effective June 1, is designed to increase the amount that servicemembers receive and reduce the out-of-pocket housing costs, while remaining below the ceiling,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement. All men and women in the military who are not required to live in government quarters receive a basic housing allowance each month. Since 1981, those men and women assigned to bases in high-cost parts of the country have also received a variable housing allowance. Congress authorized the supplemental allowance with the goal of standardizing the housing purchasing power of those in the military regardless of where they are located. The payments can range from a few dollars a month to more than $ 300 a month depending upon the area, rank of the individual and whether there are dependents. In some special cases, such as in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, the payment can exceed $ 500 a month. Currently, about 815,000 of the nation's 2.1 million active-duty people in the service are receiving a monthly variable housing assistance payment. The Pentagon has requested a 3.6 percent increase in the payment in the fiscal 1990 budget, which is now undergoing congressional review.

 Jewish settlers shot up a <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> village Friday in the second vigilante raid in two days, wounding at least three people and damaging houses and cars, residents and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said. The radio reported another raid Friday evening, but gave no details. Fifteen armed settlers conducted a patrol Friday in <LOCATION> Hebron </LOCATION>, where the first vigilante raid occurred the night before, breaking into several houses. Five paratroopers who escorted them did not interfere, but fired into the air with the settlers when Palestinians threw stones. A <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> minister in the coalition government claimed the vigilantism among the 70,000 Jewish settlers in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> was intended to block Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s plan for Palestinian elections. A dissident Cabinet minister from <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s conservative <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc announced opposition to the proposal, and Trade Minister <PERSON> Ariel </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON>, the leading <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> opponent, toured the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> to show support for the settlers. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, returning from a trip abroad, would not answer questions about settler raids and said only: `` I do n't think we are facing a very serious situation. If it's necessary to do something, we shall do it.'' Soldiers dispersed a march by about 500 Arabs in the <LOCATION> Dheisheh </LOCATION> refugee camp near <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION> with gunfire, wounding seven people. The protesters, most wearing masks, raised outlawed <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> flags and shouted slogans through portable loudspeakers. The march commemorated three Palestinians killed by soldiers last month. Arab hospital officials in east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION> said a 15-year-old girl was hospitalized with a stomach wound, another young woman had leg wounds and five people were treated and released. Residents of <LOCATION> Arura </LOCATION>, a village of 1,400 Palestinians about 20 miles north of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, said 20 to 40 settlers invaded it from surrounding hills at 9 a.m. <PERSON> Mahmoud </PERSON> <PERSON> Salah </PERSON>, a teacher, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> they started shooting at houses and people in the streets. `` We are sure they were settlers,'' he said. `` They were dressed in civilian clothes and did not act like security agents, because they fired indiscriminately.'' He said men, women and children rushed out and began pelted the attackers with stones. <PERSON> Salah </PERSON> said the settlers left after three hours. The daughter of village leader <PERSON> Yusef </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahmoud </PERSON>, who would not give her first name, said the invaders smashed two cars and punctured the windows of five houses with bullets. Villagers said five people were wounded, but <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio and officials at nearby <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> reported only three casualties, including 19-year-old <PERSON> Suleiman </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kandil </PERSON> with a serious stomach wound. Mahmound, the village leader, said soldiers arrived soon after the settlers left, in turn clashing with stone-throwing Palestinians. He said one man was detained. `` We did not see Jewish settlers there but the residents claim settlers attacked them,'' an army spokesman said. `` We are checking it.'' <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said settlers from <LOCATION> Oranim </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Shaarei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tikva </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> raided nearby Arab villages Friday evening, saying they wanted to avenge a firebomb attack on an Israeli car. The radio said there were no casualties. On Thursday night, hundreds of settlers from <LOCATION> Kiryat </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arba </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> fired into <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> homes on the outskirts of neighboring <LOCATION> Hebron </LOCATION>. Palestinians said there were no casualties but windows of at least six houses were smashed. <PERSON> Aharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Domb </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Hebron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> run by the settlers said the raid was a response to firebomb attacks on two Israeli-owned cars Thursday, which caused no injuries. `` Since the politicians are not applying the law ... <PERSON> Kiryat </PERSON> <PERSON> Arba </PERSON> residents were forced to respond to the Arab rioters,'' he said on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio. `` They did this, in part, by firing straight into buildings.'' Health Minister <PERSON> Yaacov </PERSON> <PERSON> Tsur </PERSON> of Labor blamed the rise in settler violence on `` the settlement leaders' clear desire to torpedo the peace move, the chance to reach elections and a dialogue with Palestinians.'' Under <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s plan, backed by Labor and approved earlier this month by a <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> vote of 20-6, autonomy for 1.7 million Palestinians in the occupied lands would be negotiated with representatives arrested by them. Palestinians criticize the plan for not committing <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to withdraw from the territories, where an uprising began nearly 18 months ago. At least 498 Palestinains have been killed and 22 Israelis also have been slain. Right-wing politicians and settlers see the <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> proposal as a step toward a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state, which they consider a threat to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s existence. Rebels in the conservative bloc have demanded a meeting of the 2,600-member <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> central committee to defeat or amend the plan, and have the support of the three most powerful figures after the prime minister: <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON>, Housing Minister <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Levy </PERSON> and Economy Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Modai </PERSON>. <PERSON> Levy </PERSON> announced in newspaper interviews Friday he would voter against the plan at the party meeting, tentatively set for next month. <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> insists the uprising end before any elections are held.

<HEAD>USDA Says Sales to Soviets Help Push Farm Exports to Seven-Year High</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Huge grain sales to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, part of it wheat subsidized by the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> taxpayer, are helping push <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agricultural exports to a seven-year high of $ 39 billion, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Friday. The new export forecast was up $ 1 billion from the previous projection made in February. The near-record $ 39 billion would be for the fiscal year that will end on Sept. 30. Only 1981 and 1982 would be greater. `` If realized, export value would be the highest since fiscal 1982,'' the report said. `` Prospective larger coarse grain sales to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> -LRB- mainly corn -RRB- account for much of the increase. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> grain sales to the Soviets are now expected to reach a record high.'' But the report added that `` an improved outlook for cotton and livestock'' products also have contributed to the upward revision in the export total. Although total <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agricultural export values are up sharply from a decade low of $ 26.3 billion just three years ago, they still are below the record sales of $ 43.8 billion in the 1981 fiscal year, when actual quantities totaled more than 160 million tons. Exports dropped to $ 39.1 billion and 157.9 million tons in 1982. The report said the 1989 tonnage will decline to 146.5 million tons from 148.3 million last year. But higher prices will more than offset the smaller quantity and boost the total value. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldthwait </PERSON>, acting general sales manager for the department's <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, said in a related announcement that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has bought an additional 300,000 metric tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat under a new line of subsidies approved by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> earlier in the month. Under pressure from wheat area lawmakers, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on May 2 approved a new subsidy line for <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> of 1.5 million tons, about half of what had been sought. The Soviets had been buying subsidized wheat in the past but the authorization had run out. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> has 910,200 tons of wheat still available under the May 2 subsidy announcement, <PERSON> Goldthwait </PERSON> said. He said the latest sales by seven exporting companies call for shipment in the first half of June. The subsidies average $ 8.89 per ton, or about 24 cents per bushel of wheat. The total for the 300,000 tons would be about $ 2.7 million. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> had bought more than 4 million tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat for 1988-89 delivery at prices subsidized under the department's Export Enhancement Program, or EEP. The latest sales pushed total corn and wheat sales to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> for delivery this year under terms of the long-term supply agreement between the two countries to a record of more than 20 million tons, surpassing the old mark of 18.6 million tons shipped to the Soviets in 1984-85. Corn, which is not subsidized, makes up more than 15.6 million tons of the current total, with wheat at 4.6 million tons. In addition, the Soviets have bought 443,000 tons of soybeans, 1.37 million tons of soybean meal, and 807,400 tons of grain sorghums. A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 39.4 bushels of corn or 36.7 bushels of wheat or soybeans. The 300,000 tons of wheat would be about 11 million bushels. Wheat prices have been averaging about $ 4 per bushel at the farm level, according to the latest <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> five-day average, meaning that the latest sale could have a farm value of around $ 44 million. Under EEP arrangements, private exporters can sell <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> commodities at reduced prices in order to meet foreign competition in selected overseas markets and then collect free government surpluses of grain or other commodities as bonuses, or subsidies. <PERSON> Goldthwait </PERSON> said the new subsidized wheat sales were handled by <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, 95,000 tons; <ORGANIZATION> Garnac </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, 20,000; <ORGANIZATION> Peavey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, 60,000; <LOCATION> Harvest </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> Cooperatives, 25,000; <ORGANIZATION> Tradigrain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, 50,000; <ORGANIZATION> Louis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dreyfus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, 25,000; and <ORGANIZATION> Bunge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, 25,000.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> on Friday delayed the liftoff of a military navigation satellite because electrical repairs at the launch pad will take longer than officials expected. June 5 is the earliest the $ 65 million Navstar Global Positioning Satellite can be launched atop its <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> 2 rocket booster, said Capt. <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Warren </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. It will be the fifth launch attempt. The Delta 2-Navstar was to have flown May 20, but bad weather forced three postponements. A fourth launch attempt was aborted Wednesday because of a wiring problem at the launch pad. Officials had predicted the circuit would be repaired in time for a launch May 31, but technicians working at the pad on Friday found several aging electrical components that need to be replaced. `` The components were due to expire soon, so rather than risk a problem with them later, they decided to change them out,'' <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> explained. Wednesday's scheduled launch was aborted at the last second when a computer shut down the Delta 2's main engine before it could fire. Experts investigating the incident discovered an electrical problem that blocked the path of an ignition command sent by launch controllers to an engine valve. The valve did not open and starved the engine of fuel.

 More than 160 ethnic Turks deported from <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> arrived in <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> on Friday and said at least 30 people have died in recent clashes between Turks and security forces in <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>. The deportees said growing resistance to an assimilation campaign in <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> led to the violence. The campaign includes forcing ethnic Turks to change their Moslem names to Slavic ones. `` At least 30 are dead, 200 seriously injured and about 2,000 have been arrested,'' said <PERSON> Tahsin </PERSON> <PERSON> Haliloglu </PERSON>, one of 167 deported ethnic Turks who arrived in <LOCATION> Ankara </LOCATION>.

 Police questioned witnesses Friday who saw a yellow vehicle speed away after two young American missionaries were cut down by machine-gun fire. A guerrilla group has claimed responsibility. The bodies of <PERSON> Todd </PERSON> <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Ball </PERSON>, both 20-year-old Mormons from <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, were taken to the La Paz airport for return to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>'s hometown was <LOCATION> Wellington </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Ball </PERSON> was from <LOCATION> Coalville </LOCATION>. They were killed as they returned home Wednesday night. A statement distributed to La Paz newspapers claimed responsibility on behalf of the <ORGANIZATION> Zarate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Willka </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>. It said, in part: `` The violation of our sovereignty can not go unpunished. The Yankee invaders who come to massacre our fellow farmers are warned, as are their local slaves. We the poor have no other road than to rise up in arms. Our hatred is implacable and our war is to the death.'' <PERSON> Zarate </PERSON> <PERSON> Willka </PERSON> was a 19th century Indian revolutionary in <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>. The group using his name also claimed responsibility for a bomb that exploded in August near a motorcade carrying <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, then secretary of state. Several vehicles were damaged but no injuries were reported. Interior Minister <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> Beltran </PERSON> said the group `` does not have a political affilitation and one can not therefore speak of the existence of guerillas in the country. We are facing something that could also come from ... the cocaine trade.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy officials, who are cooperating in the investigation, say the responsibility is not yet clear. The two missionaries of the Church of Latter Day Saints lived near a Mormon church that was seriously damaged by a bomb in 1988. They arrived a year ago and were working in the <LOCATION> Villa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Victoria </LOCATION> neighborhood near downtown La Paz. About 400 Mormon missionaries are assigned to <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>, church officials said. American officials said security had been strengthened for the embassy and its personnel.

<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration is considering a policy change that could halve the admissions of Soviet refugees to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, a Jewish community official said Friday. The proposed limitation is one of several options under review in an attempt to cope with an unprecedented flow of Soviets, most of them Jews, being allowed to leave under the glasnost policies of <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. If implemented, the new policy could be a boon for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> which accepts every Soviet Jew who can get out. In recent years, about 90 percent of Soviet Jews have opted to come to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> rather than <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> of the American Jewish Committee. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, facing a slump in Jewish immigration and a surge in the birthrate among its Arab minority, has been pushing for years to get more Soviet Jews. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> had no immediate comment on the matter, saying only that various options were under review for dealing with the influx of Soviet emigres. Jewish groups and the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> estimate that as many as 75,000 Soviets will be granted exit visas this year, about 55,000 of them Jews and the rest Pentecostalists and Armenians. About 18,000 Soviets have left the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> so far this year, and another 26,000 applicants are waiting to be interviewed at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>. The vast majority of Soviet emigres are awarded refugee status by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which means their way here and resettlement is paid by the government. Next year the numbers are expected to increase further, presenting the budget-strapped administration with a severe problem. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration, which only budgeted for some 22,500 Soviet refugees for fiscal 1989, has asked <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to fund an additional 22,500 Soviet refugees this fiscal year. The White House has also asked for an emergency allocation of $ 100 million to deal with the influx. In addition, Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> has proposed legislation that would allow 30,000 admissions of Soviets annually, although not as refugees. Other categories of admissions, such as immigrants, are not eligible for full federal funding. Under the proposed change, Soviet applicants would no longer be eligible for refugee status unless they have relatives in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> or a close affiliation with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> through education or other ties, said <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, whose organization lobbies for Soviet Jews. Existing policy allows admission of Soviets as refugees under a category of `` national interest,'' in other words because <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> foreign policy interests seek to encourage the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> to allow freer emigration. Removing Soviets from that eligibility would bring their treatment in line with that of other refugee groups, like <PERSON> Hispanics </PERSON> and Asians, <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> said. An attempt to curb the number of Soviet refugees through a policy directive from former attorney general <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> last summer failed when <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> lawmakers and Jewish groups protested. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> directed that Soviet Jews would no longer be automatically granted refugee status on an assumption that they all suffered religious persecution, and instead would be dealt with on a case-by-case basis. The Immigration and <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> began implementing the change and as many as 70 percent of refugee applicants were rejected. But as a result of pressure from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, refugee acceptance has gone up to about 80 percent for Soviet Jews, <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> said.

 Here is a transcript of remarks by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s Prime Minister <PERSON> Ciriaco </PERSON> <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Mita </PERSON> as <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> arrived Friday en route to a summit with <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> leaders. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Mita </PERSON> -LRB- through translator -RRB-: Mr. President, I extend to you, also on behalf of the <LOCATION> Italian </LOCATION> people, my most sincere and warm welcome. We particularly appreciate your visit at the beginning of a challenging mission in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. In this visit, we perceive the token of that special and deep-rooted relationship binding the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> through a sincere friendship and a strong alliance. Furthermore, Mr. <PERSON> President </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> is aware of your personal commitment to the search for peace, and for the defense of human rights throughout the world. This commitment lives up to the best and highest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> tradition and makes you a particularly welcome guest for the entire Italian people. You arrive in a <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> where the winds of change are blowing. The outstanding events occurring in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> countries and the achievements of `` Community <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'' have generated elements of movement which open new prospects. It is up to us to grasp their meaning and channel them for the best for our peoples and for peace. Time has come to view these changes with courage, without relinquishing the vigorous loyalty to the ideals upon which our free societies are founded. As times are changing, the solidarity between <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, between <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, based on a thorough sharing of values remains a cornerstone and a prerequisite for facing these very changes. I am convinced that your visit will contribute to strengthen our friendship, and it is in this spirit that I have the pleasure of welcoming you to <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>.

 Bush: Well, let me begin by thanking all of you and my personal friend, my good friend, Prime Minister <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Mita </PERSON>, for welcoming us to <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> at this late hour. Since ancient times, the saying goes, `` All roads lead to <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>,'' and that's still true. And it is very fitting that here I begin my first step on this first trip to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> as president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> has long been a wellspring of Western culture and Western values, fostering the alliance in a more unified <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. I hope that our visit to <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> will demonstrate just how strongly the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> respects and appreciates <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s role as a staunch ally and as a constant friend. When our calm and security has been threatened, you have been ready to strengthen the alliance. And when <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> appeared ready to loosen the ties that sustained it, you've kept those important trans-Atlantic ties alive and strong. And when conflict has threatened, you have been in the front ranks of those searching for solutions. The bond between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> runs deep. It's a bond of family, of culture, of shared interests and common vision. And the world around us is changing, but we can be sure that our friendship will endure. Mr. Prime Minister, when we last met, we talked of new developments around the world, of change in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, of new opportunities for arms reductions, of the growing unity of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>; and in recent weeks, I've spoken of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s vision for world peace. I have said that we are prepared to move beyond containment toward a policy that works to bring the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> into the community of nations. We will be actively engaged in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, promoting measures to encourage political and economic liberalization in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> welcomes a stronger and more united <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. We believe, as I know you do, that <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> unity and the trans-Atlantic partnership reinforce each other. Over the next two days, we'll have the opportunity to engage in renewed dialogue as partners, certainly as friends. And I hope that our conversations are shaped by our shared expectations for the future and by our determination to see our future succeed. I am delighted to be back in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>. Thank you again for this warm welcome.

 The new <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> Deputies nominated a handful of radicals Friday to serve in its working legislature, opening the lawmaking process to broader participation after decades of Kremlin monopoly. But some progressives charged that <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> bureaucrats had rigged the process to stay in power, and others accused the radicals of undermining the course of political reform. With Lithuanians announcing at one point they would boycott elections to choose the membership of the new legislature, the Supreme Soviet, President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> declared the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION> in a `` crisis situation'' on only the second day of its existence. The 2,250-member parliament was choosing members to fill its 542-seat working legislature, called the Supreme Soviet. Candidates originally were selected in local caucuses. But they had to be nominated by the congress before they could stand for election. Most delegations nominated only one candidate for each seat they were alloted, but a few offered more. It is in those districts where there are real races. Candidates who get the highest number of votes and more than 50 percent are elected. The final number of deputies nominated Friday was `` around 600,'' according to one official who addressed the congress. The deputies wrangled for hours over the nominations as members bickered about procedure and traded accusations of obstructionism. The debate got sidetracked by a heated squabble over police attempts to break up a street meeting called to discuss the first day of parliamentary debate. Voting finally began 12 -LCB- hours after the congress convened, with weary deputies filing out of the hall to cast ballots. Results were expected when the congress meets again Saturday morning. Populist <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> was on the list of 573 congress members selected by their home regions to serve in the Supreme Soviet _ which took its name from the old, rubber-stamp parliament. The procedure set up tough races for lawmakers from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, where some of the best-known progressives are running. `` The party apparatus is once again asking us to elect the Supreme Soviet according to the old system,'' complained deputy <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevlyuga </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Rostov-on-Don </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Zolotukhin </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Uzbekistan </LOCATION> complained the top party and government officials in his Central Asian republic had nominated themselves as in the past. Nevertheless, the candidates' list showed that the new Supreme Soviet will have a far different makeup from the old one, which met for only a few days a year to unanimously approve any bill put before it and vigorously applaud the speeches of top <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> officials. Only one member of the <ORGANIZATION> ruling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Politburo </ORGANIZATION> _ <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> federation President <PERSON> Vitaly </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vorotnikov </PERSON> _ is on the list of candidates. Nominations were closed for most republics, assuring the election of a small group of progressives, including Estonian <PERSON> Marju </PERSON> <PERSON> Lauristin </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Lithuanian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kazimir </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Motieka </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> leaders who led fights to declare their republics sovereign. Live coverage by state-run TV continued to show Soviets the novel spectacle of their representatives openly airing disagreements, and many viewers were riveted to their sets, despite the snail's pace of parliamentary action. The Lithuanians announced through <PERSON> Vytautas </PERSON> <PERSON> Landsbergis </PERSON>, chairman of the grassroots reform group <ORGANIZATION> Sajudis </ORGANIZATION>, that they would boycott the elections if deputies from other republics were allowed to vote on which Lithuanians should serve in the Supreme Soviet. <PERSON> Landsbergis </PERSON> also said parliamentarians from his tiny homeland on the <LOCATION> Baltic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> did not want to cast ballots to elect people to the Supreme Soviet from other regions of this vast country. `` We ca n't elect people who are not known to us,'' he said. `` It's not right to vote in the darkness.'' <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON>, a Moscow-based historian whose exposes of <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s bloody abuses of power were once banned in his native country, appealed for reconsideration of the boycott threat. `` I ask the comrades from <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION> ... not to break the huge amount of work done in our society to democratize it,'' <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON> said, a giant statue of Soviet founder <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON> at his back. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, who chaired the meeting, said the Lithuanian boycott sparked a `` crisis situation'' in the fledgling parliament. But after murky debate and a series of recesses, the body moved toward a secret ballot on the legislative candidates. The exchange demonstrated the competing interests even among Soviet progressives. The Lithuanians and their Baltic neighbors want to protect their small reform slates from being voted down in an all-congress vote. They fear conservatives from the giant Russian federation, the <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION> or Central Asia could reject reform-minded candidates from the <ORGANIZATION> Baltics </ORGANIZATION>. However, <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> deputies, many of whom are national celebrities, insisted on presenting a slate of 55 candidates for the 29 seats allocated to them to underline the principle of contested elections. On the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> slate are some of the nation's best-known progressives, including <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON>; economist <PERSON> Gavril </PERSON> <PERSON> Popov </PERSON>; academic <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> <PERSON> Stankevich </PERSON>; <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Chernichenko </PERSON>, an agriculture reform advocate; and <PERSON> Ilya </PERSON> <PERSON> Zaslavskaya </PERSON>, an advocate for the handicapped. <PERSON> Stankevich </PERSON> said reformers had gone into Friday's session seeking a rule to bar regional <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> bosses from retaining their jobs _ and the clout and perquisites they provide _ while serving simultaneously in the Supreme Soviet. But when <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> put the proposal to a vote, only 636 deputies voted to relieve lawmakers of their previous jobs, although a majority said members should not have to perform other duties during legislative sessions, which are expected to last about eight months of the year.

 In a break with Kremlin leaders' traditional isolation, Premier <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> waded into a crowd of reporters and parliamentarians outside the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Friday. It was the second night in a row such a thing had happened. On Thursday, Defense Minister <PERSON> Dmitri </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yazov </PERSON> traded World War II stories with deputies and Politburo member <PERSON> Vadim </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON> chatted with foreign reporters. <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> is No. 2 man in the Soviet government. After he genially answered questions on everything from housing loans to private film-making in the dusk of a northern summer, security men built like boxers lectured Soviet reporters for snagging the boss for a second round of questioning before the premier strode off under the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>'s blooming chestnuts and lilacs. `` Hey, we're journalists, it's our job,'' said <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Sokorov </PERSON>, a local newspaper reporter. The security men had little to fear, however, as all the deputies and news media people had passed a gauntlet of guards to enter the brick-walled fortress in the center of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> during the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Still, it was a thrill for the mass of newly elected deputies from ordinary walks of life to find their previously remote leaders within touching distance. At least 50 crowded around <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> Friday night, until the pack became so thick it was impossible to identify the attraction in the middle. <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON>'s appearances carried a slight air of campaigning, since he faces the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in his first election test possibly on Saturday. The political reform that created the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> also gave it the power to confirm the premier, and he has come under fire from a few deputies in the past week for his work on the economy and the environment. `` My soul hurts when I think about pensions,'' <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> said Friday in response to a question about a deputy's demand for increases in payments as low as $ 36 a month to retirees. `` He says we must find the money. But how?'' <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> said he is convinced that `` individual plots and the construction of individual houses'' must be permitted to solve a housing crunch, but left <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> out of that possibility without explaining. Development of the Soviet space shuttle led to creation of 100 new industrial materials, he boasted. But dragging those ideas into the domestic economy is proving far harder. `` We should create such economic conditions that people chase after them,'' he said. Private cooperatives may be controversial but they're an explosive success in the government's economic reform program, he said. In the 2 -LCB- years since the small businesses were legalized, 100,000 have cropped up. They contributed about $ 6.75 billion to the economy in just the first three months of this year, he said.

 Students camped out in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s central square tried to gauge the shifting political winds Friday but said their protest would continue no matter who runs the country. <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON>, the leader most sympathetic to the demonstrators' demands, was reported to have been ousted and placed under house arrest in a power struggle with Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON>. The number of students in <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> had dwindled to about 15,000, but student leaders said they were undeterred by the apparent ascendancy of <PERSON> Li </PERSON>, who has taken a much harder line with the demonstrators. `` It's going to get more complex,'' said a student leader from <ORGANIZATION> Qinghua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> who would only give his name as <PERSON> Xin </PERSON>. `` We ca n't ascertain what the leaders' intentions are, but we will not leave the square. <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> sources say <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> has been stripped of all powers and that <PERSON> Li </PERSON> is in charge of party and government functons. `` <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON> was relatively open-minded,'' <PERSON> Xin </PERSON> said atop the People's Heroes Monument in <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>, where the student leaders have set up their headquarters. `` We do n't feel that he was the savior of all <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, but he was more capable than <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON>.'' The students, who began their protests April 15 by seeking talks with the government on social reforms and profiteering by bureaucrats, are demanding <PERSON> Li </PERSON>'s resignation. <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON>'s apparent ouster has not weakened the students' resolve to stay in the square until <PERSON> Li </PERSON> resigns because `` everybody in the country is watching the square,'' <PERSON> Xin </PERSON> said. `` If we leave, we will betray their hopes.'' `` Students are not losing hope just because <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> is sacked,'' said a <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> medical student. `` Our belief is firm and can not be moved.'' <PERSON> Ren </PERSON> <PERSON> Ju </PERSON>, a senior at the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nationalities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, said students preferred <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> over <PERSON> Li </PERSON>. `` We did n't really like <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON> before all this started, but after the hunger fast, he came to visit the strikers on the square and said he would work to eradicate corruption starting with his own children,'' <PERSON> Ren </PERSON> said. His removal will not deter students from their sit-in, <PERSON> Ren </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Guo </PERSON> <PERSON> Weiming </PERSON>, a senior at <ORGANIZATION> Xian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, said: `` We do n't feel simply that <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> should replace <PERSON> Li </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Guo </PERSON> said. `` I'm not convinced he could represent the people's interests. <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> reportedly angered party conservatives with an impassioned speech to a group of hunger strikers in <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> last week, as well as a detailed explanation to visiting Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> last week of a secret 1987 meeting confirming senior leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON>'s paramount power. Last month he also called the student movement `` patriotic'' rather than <PERSON> Li </PERSON>'s favored description, `` disturbances.'' Not all students were convinced <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> was truly out. `` I think there's some kind of intrigue going on where we're deliberately being sent the wrong signals,'' said a sophomore at <ORGANIZATION> Tianjin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Light </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> named <PERSON> Liang </PERSON>. `` Maybe word of <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON>'s dismissal was deliberately leaked so people would rally around him,'' <PERSON> Liang </PERSON> said. `` Then if he actually came into power he would be in a better position to control the masses.''

 <ORGANIZATION> Glen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ridge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> welcomed a scheduled holiday Friday but the baseball team took the field without its captain, a reminder of the upheaval over the arrests of five students on sexual assault charges. Law enforcement officials, meanwhile, would not comment on a newspaper report Friday that the students charged in the March 1 incident asked another student to videotape them having sex with the mentally retarded girl on another occasion. The student, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Figueroa </PERSON>, a football teammate of some of the boys charged, told the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> he refused to make the tape and eventually informed authorities about the incident. There was no answer Friday in repeated attempts to call <PERSON> Figueroa </PERSON>. <PERSON> Glen </PERSON> <PERSON> Ridge </PERSON> Superintendent of Schools <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> <PERSON> McCaffrey </PERSON> said <PERSON> Figueroa </PERSON>'s comments are suspect. `` <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> has a knack of fantasizing and takes off and starts discussing things,'' Ms. <PERSON> McCaffrey </PERSON> said. `` I'm not saying this is not true at all,'' she said. `` Because of the statements he made, we immediately notified police.'' Ms. <PERSON> McCaffrey </PERSON> said <PERSON> Figueroa </PERSON> told a teacher what the other students had told him about the sexual assault, and was kept out of school for several days on the request of his mother, <PERSON> Mary </PERSON>, who feared retaliation from students. <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <LOCATION> Essex </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> prosecutor's office, would not comment on the report, but said, `` We are pursuing all angles of the investigation.'' There was no indication a second episode took place. The five students were arrested Wednesday and charged with sexually assaulting a 17-year-old girl with a broomstick and miniature baseball bat. Eight other male teens cheered the attack without intervening, investigators said. Two of those charged, twin brothers <PERSON> Kyle </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Scherzer </PERSON>, are captains of the football team and <PERSON> Kyle </PERSON> is captain of the baseball team, which played a game without him Friday. All five have been suspended from school for 10 days. `` The student body is divided but this is, I guess, to be expected,'' said Ms. <PERSON> McCaffrey </PERSON>. `` There are feelings of friendship and antagonism.'' Some students friendly with those charged said the young woman, who has since turned 18, willingly participated in the incident. Friends of the young woman said she did not fully understand what was happening. Officials have said she attends special education classes but have not elaborated on the extent of her mental impairment. Attorneys for some of the boys charged Friday criticized the media attention and the prosecutor's handling of the case. `` I think it's awful because, first of all, whether you're a parent, victim or alleged defendant, it's a tragedy and there is a presumption of innocence,'' said <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Merkelbach </PERSON>, attorney for the Scherzers. `` I understand the media's job but I think they have infringed upon the presumption of innocence.''

<HEAD>600 Bodies Found In Post-War Mass Grave</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A mass grave discovered near the capital last month contains the remains of more than 600 men, women and children buried between 1944 and 1947 by <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> and Polish secret police, official and independent reports said Thursday. The bodies appear to include both German POWs and Polish resistance fighters who were arrested by the Soviet secret police after the war, according to <ORGANIZATION> Gazeta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wyborcza </ORGANIZATION>, an independent Solidarity newspaper, and the officially published daily <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wieczorny </ORGANIZATION>. The investigation comes during increasing efforts, backed by the communist government, to acknowledge repressions of the postwar years. The chairman of the Council for Preserving the <ORGANIZATION> Memory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Struggle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Martyrdom </ORGANIZATION>, Gen. <PERSON> Roman </PERSON> <PERSON> Paszkowski </PERSON>, told the state <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> news agency Thursday that searches were in progress for graves of Polish officers and other victims of `` reprisals of the Stalinist period.'' An unknown number of Poles, many of whom fought with the underground Home Army against the Nazi occupiers during World War II, were executed by <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> secret police after the war. The Home Army remained loyal to the Polish government-in-exile during the war, and the Soviets considered its officers suspect when communists came to power in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> after 1944. Some were believed to have been executed in secret and others were deported to Siberian prisons. `` We will do our best to commemorate events, places and figures in our history in tune with historical truth,'' <PERSON> Paszkowski </PERSON> said. In <LOCATION> Otwock </LOCATION>, the bodies were found piled in five layers after a journalist decided to follow up on rumors circulating in the area. When bones and skulls were unearthed, the mayor named a priest and two representatives of the independent Solidarity movement to an investigatory commission. The commission examined about 400 bodies, and found 50 percent had some signs of postmortem dissection. None had been victims of shooting, according to <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION>. The bodies were unclothed and no objects that could lead to identification have been found in the grave, which is in a wooded area, <ORGANIZATION> Gazeta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wyborcza </ORGANIZATION> said. Longtime residents told investigators about seeing the burial of bodies of German POWs who died of disease and starvation at a Soviet prison camp in the town, the newspaper said. The German prisoners were pitifully thin and would plead through a fence for scraps of bread, residents recalled. One witness recounted being told to bury his wife, a <ORGANIZATION> Polish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> officer arrested on charges of anti-Soviet activities by the Polish secret police. She died at the Soviet prison hospital in <LOCATION> Otwock </LOCATION> in 1947, he said. <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Grzeskowiak </PERSON>, interviewed in Express Wieczorny, said she was a nurse at the hospital and tended to dying German POWs and <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> prisoners whose bodies were taken to be buried.

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Lukens </PERSON> was convicted Friday of having sex with a 16-year-old girl whose mother accused the congressman of offering a government job to buy her silence. Hours after the verdict, one <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> congressman called for <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION>' resignation, but an aide predicted he would seek re-election next year `` I think he should do the gentlemanly thing and resign,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Chalmers </PERSON> <PERSON> Wylie </PERSON>, the senior Republican among <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>'s congressional delegation <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> also is a Republican. A jury deliberated for 1 -LCB- hours before finding <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> guilty of contributing to the delinquency and unruliness of a minor, stemming from an incident last Nov. 6. The misdemeanor carries a maximum sentence of 180 days in jail and a $ 1,000 fine. <PERSON> Lukens </PERSON> stood still, his hands pressed on the defense table and his mouth slightly open, as <LOCATION> Franklin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Domestic Relations Judge <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Solove </PERSON> read the verdict. The 58-year-old divorced congressman from <LOCATION> Middletown </LOCATION> was indicted Feb. 23, about three weeks after <ORGANIZATION> Columbus </ORGANIZATION> television station <ORGANIZATION> WSYX </ORGANIZATION> broadcast a secretly recorded videotape that appeared to show <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> offering to find the girl's mother, <PERSON> Anna </PERSON> <PERSON> Coffman </PERSON>, a job. She had gone to the station to get help and agreed to the secret taping. On the tape, the woman asked <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> why he was `` messing around'' with her daughter, <PERSON> Rosie </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> replied, `` Well, first of all, I did n't really know she was a teen-ager.'' Toward the end of the tape, <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> said, `` Let me go back -LRB- to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> -RRB- and see what there is part-time and ... -LRB- inaudible -RRB-. ... I do n't know what, uh, the government has, but I can check and find out.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Coffman </PERSON> testified that the offer was to try to buy her silence, while <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> called it an extortion attempt. <PERSON> Rosie </PERSON> <PERSON> Coffman </PERSON> told reporters she was pleased with the verdict. `` I'm happy to see justice is done,'' she said. Asked if she hated <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION>, said said, `` No, I do n't hate him. I do n't hate anybody.'' A misdemeanor conviction does not automatically trigger an Ethics <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> investigation or bar a member from sitting in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The committee does have the option of investigating such cases and recommending action such as censure. <PERSON> Solove </PERSON> delayed sentencing pending the completion of a presentence investigation. <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> declined to comment on the verdict before he left the courthouse through a private hallway and elevator. His chief of staff, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Jarrell </PERSON>, said he planned to make a statement next week about his personal and political future. `` The congressman will be spending some quiet time, speaking to family and friends to get a lot of opinion and advice,'' <PERSON> Jarrell </PERSON> said. `` But I'll say this, we will be running.'' <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> was first elected to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> in 1966, serving two terms before dropping out to make an unsuccessful bid for the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> governorship. After serving terms in the state <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION>, he returned to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> in 1987. <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION>' attorney, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyack </PERSON>, said <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> would appeal on the grounds that evidence about the girl's background was not presented to the jury. `` The primary grounds will be the exclusion of Ms. <PERSON> Coffman </PERSON>'s juvenile record, <ORGANIZATION> Children </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> file and school records, which were critical to our case,'' he said `` I also found evidence of reverse discrimination, which may be cited in the appeal.'' The girl is black, and <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> is white. Neither the girl nor her mother was in the courtroom when the verdict was read. Assistant Prosecutor <PERSON> Rita </PERSON> <PERSON> Mangini </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> contributed to the girl's unruliness and delinquency by giving her alcohol, paying for her cab ride to his apartment and having sex with her because he knew she was underage. During the grand jury investigation, the <LOCATION> Franklin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> prosecutor sought an additional indictment stemming from an alleged sexual encounter between <ORGANIZATION> Lukens </ORGANIZATION> and the girl in 1985, when she was 13. The grand jury determined there was insufficient evidence because of conflicting testimony from the girl.

 <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Friday she's looking for a good book to read but it wo n't be a gossipy new biography about former first lady <PERSON> Jacqueline </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>. `` I'm not going to read that,'' the first lady said. `` It's not a nice book.'' Commenting on two books being written about her now, Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` Trust me, they're not going to be page-turners unless they're fiction.'' Accompanying President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>, the first stop on a four-nation European tour, Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> chatted with reporters on Air Force One for about 20 minutes during the nine-hour flight across the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION>. For the trip, she changed from a black and white dress she wore to a departure ceremony at <ORGANIZATION> Andrews </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Base to tan slacks and a turquoise knit top and red loafers. Despite a thyroid ailment that has irritated her eyes and caused a weight loss, Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said she felt wonderful and was swimming and playing tennis daily. She said she expected to continue her exercise regimen during her week in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The discussion of books arose when she said she had brought something to read but was n't satisfied with it. `` I need a good book,'' she said, quickly exhorting reporters not to invite the public to deluge her with suggestions. Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said she was cooperating with the authors of two books about her, but that the books were not officially authorized. `` Well, I can hardly wait to read them,'' she said. `` They'll be a lot more interesting than my life.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the idea of writing a book about her now is `` so silly. I'm not done yet. I do n't know what I want to be when I grow up.'' The first lady also disclosed she will host a White House luncheon on June 5 for <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> wives, and that it will be attended by former first ladies <ORGANIZATION> Betty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Lady </PERSON> <PERSON> Bird </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, two former presidents of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> wives' club.

<TEXT>
 University students decided Friday to keep striking nationwide until they win `` final victory'' and receive permission to register a pro-Solidarity association, spokesmen said. Members of the banned <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Students </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, or <ORGANIZATION> NZS </ORGANIZATION>, said they formed an interschool strike committee to coordinate protest activities. Students stressed at a news conference that they did not want their strike to disturb election campaigning now going on in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and would not call for a boycott of the voting June 4. The annual exam period is scheduled to begin Monday, and strike organizers said students should take their examinations. Strikers, however, planned to continue to occupy academic buildings. `` The national strike committee created today has decided to continue the strikes until final victory,'' a statement read at a student rally said. The strikes began Tuesday after a <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> court rejected the application to register NZS. The court said the group illegally claimed the right to hold strikes. Banners saying, `` We demand registration of NZS'' hung from the gates of <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Polytechnic </ORGANIZATION>, an engineering school. <ORGANIZATION> NZS </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Slawomir </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorecki </PERSON> reported student strikes in <LOCATION> Wroclaw </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Lodz </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poznan </LOCATION> and Plock, and strike alerts in other cities. Authorities made no attempt to evict the strikers. Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s Roman Catholic primate, Cardinal <PERSON> Jozef </PERSON> <PERSON> Glemp </PERSON>, endorsed <ORGANIZATION> NZS </ORGANIZATION>'s right to be registered and offered their help. Actor <PERSON> Andrzej </PERSON> <PERSON> Lapicki </PERSON>, a Solidarity parliamentary candidate, appeared with French movie star <PERSON> Yves </PERSON> <PERSON> Montand </PERSON> on Friday at a rally of about 750 students at <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and both voiced support for the students' cause. <PERSON> Montand </PERSON> told the crowd through an interpreter, `` To defend Solidarity means to defend democracy and freedom in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and in the world. And today, I feel united with Solidarity and with <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> students. I also feel united with students in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>.'' After the rally, about 100 of the students blocked a main street in front of the university for about one hour before giving up the blockade peacefully.

 A <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> political era ended Friday when former Vice President <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON> said he will not challenge Republican <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Rudy </PERSON> <PERSON> Boschwitz </PERSON> in 1990 or seek any other elective office in the future. `` I believe it's time for other candidates to step forward,'' said <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON>, a former senator who was the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s presidential nominee in 1984 `` It was a very difficult choice for us.'' <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON> and his mentor, the late <PERSON> Hubert </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON>, dominated <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> politics from 1948, when <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> was elected to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, to 1980, when the Carter-Mondale ticket lost the presidential race. Both <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON> and <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON>, who died in 1978, represented <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, served as vice president and were unsuccessful Democratic presidential nominees. `` A lot of the people I worked for have been dead for a long time and at some point, even <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON> has to get out,'' said <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON>, 61. `` One of the requirements of a healthy party is that it renews itself. You ca n't keep running <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON> for everything.'' <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON> said he and his wife, <PERSON> Joan </PERSON>, have enjoyed his life out of political office and has seen too many colleagues remain in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> for too long. `` I'm at peace with myself,'' <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON> said. `` We took a lot of time making this decision and it's a basic one. It's a lot easier deciding when to get into politics as opposed to when to leave.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Penny </PERSON>, D-Minn., said <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON> has positioned himself to play the role of elder statesman `` I grew up during the Humphrey-Mondale era in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Penny </PERSON>, 37. `` I guess this kind of closes the chapter on this book.'' <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON> generally had been considered the most formidable candidate Democrats could field against <PERSON> Boschwitz </PERSON>, a two-term senator. His announcement was expected to result in an immediate scramble among <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> Democrats for their party's 1990 <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> endorsement. <PERSON> Boschwitz </PERSON>, 58, said he was relieved that <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON> had decided not to run. But <PERSON> Boschwitz </PERSON> said the race could be tough no matter who his challenger is because of <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>'s tendency to favor Democrats. `` I'm not breathing easy,'' he said. `` I'm going to keep going.'' <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> member <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Wellstone </PERSON>, a political science professor at <ORGANIZATION> Carleton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> and a leader of the Rev. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s 1988 presidential campaign in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, is the only announced challenger.

<DATELINE>COPENHAGEN, Denmark (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>, which has been in the vanguard of homosexual rights for 60 years, enacted a law Friday allowing civil marriages between couples of the same sex. The legislation gives homosexual couples the same rights as in a conventional marriage regarding inheritance, taxation, joint rights to pensions and property ownership. Gay couples, however, are not permitted to adopt children. `` Two persons of the same sex can let their partnership be registered,'' said Article 1 of the bill, in what amounted to a permission for a civil marriage. At least one partner must be a Danish citizen. Unlike in a conventional marriage, the non-Danish partner would not be entitled to citizenship as a consequence of marrying a Dane. <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION> legalized homosexuality in 1930 and has had an active gay rights movement since 1948. Authorities estimate about 20,000 homosexuals cohabit in this country of 5.1 million people. The law was designed to give homosexual couples greater social acceptibility. Proponents hoped the move would encourage couples to stay together longer and discourage promiscuity, which they said increases the danger of contracting AIDS. The bill was proposed by the leftist opposition but breezed through with the support of Prime Minister <PERSON> Poul </PERSON> <PERSON> Schlueter </PERSON>'s minority centrist coalition Parliament members who objected were asked to abstain to ensure easy passage. The small <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peoples </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> was the main opponent of the bill.

 The government responded Friday to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s expulsion of four Czechoslovaks by ordering four Britons out of the country for `` activities incompatible with their status,'' the standard term for spying. Three British diplomats and a businessman were ordered to leave within two weeks, the official news agency <ORGANIZATION> CTK </ORGANIZATION> reported. The British Foreign Office described the action as unjustified retaliation for the order Thursday that four Czechoslovak diplomats leave <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> for the same reason. <ORGANIZATION> CTK </ORGANIZATION> said the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> summoned <PERSON> Laurence </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Keefe </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> ambassador, to receive a `` resolute protest of groundless charges'' against the four Czechoslovaks. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s decision is in conflicts with `` the process of strengthening confidence and security in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>,'' the agency declared in its report. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> spokesman identified the Britons as <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON>, first secretary of administration; <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Todd </PERSON>, first secretary counselor; <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Holland </PERSON>, third secretary; and <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON>, manager for <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's clearly an unjustified action,'' said the spokesman, speaking anonymously in keeping with British custom. `` It's clearly in retaliation,'' he added, and the government will `` consider what our response will be.'' After <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> ordered the Czechslovaks to leave, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> daily <ORGANIZATION> Rude </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pravo </ORGANIZATION> said it was another case of `` British spymania, which certain British circles bring about from time to time.'' Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commons </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday the expulsions of the Czechoslovaks and of 11 Soviets a week ago were necessary `` regardless of the effect upon our relations.'' <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> had enjoyed its best relations with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> since World War II before the exchange last week, and relations with <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> were improving. Sir <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Fretwell </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> political director, said <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> ignored warnings about in its diplomats given last September, when three others were expelled. The exchange with <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> began May 19 when <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> ordered eight Soviet diplomats and three journalists out. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> retaliated a day later with expulsions of like number and kind. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and the Soviets now are discussing <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> demands that <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> reduce to 205 the number of Britons and local employees in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> says that matches the number of Soviets allowed in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. Director General <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> Kravchenko </PERSON>, head of the Soviet news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>, protested in a letter to Foreign Secretary Sir <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> on Friday over the expulsion of London-based <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> correspondent <PERSON> Igor </PERSON> <PERSON> Peskov </PERSON>. <PERSON> Kravchenko </PERSON> said <PERSON> Peskov </PERSON>, 35, was a man of `` impeccable honesty'' and had done nothing to contravene British or international law.

 Students blocked streets and set tires on fire Friday and a boy was reported killed during a third straight day of clashes between protesters and security forces in a midwestern city. The protesters are demonstrating against sharp rises in the price of some basic foods and services, resulting from the government's strict adherence to an austerity program demanded by Western creditors. The state-controlled <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nigeria </ORGANIZATION> said an order by the military governor to shoot rioters on sight and a dusk-to-dawn curfew failed to quell the disturbances in <LOCATION> Benin </LOCATION>, 165 miles east of <LOCATION> Lagos </LOCATION>. At least 100 people have been reported injured, 15 serious enough to require hospitalization, <LOCATION> Lagos </LOCATION> newspapers said. The University of <LOCATION> Benin </LOCATION> was ordered closed, the news agency said. At one stage, rioters stormed Radio <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION>'s local broadcast station and forced workers to flee, the news agency reported. The dead youth's body was found in front of the station, it said. <LOCATION> Lagos </LOCATION> newspapers said police had avoided confronting the rioters during the first two days of demonstrations. The students, joined by some local street traders, market women, taxi drivers and unemployed men, also broke into a local jail and freed 600 prisoners.

<HEAD>Asahi President Quits After Cameraman Damages Rare Coral Reef</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The president of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s second-largest newspaper said Friday he will resign to take responsibility for an incident in which a staff photographer damaged a rare coral reef to illustrate a story on environmental destruction. <ORGANIZATION> Asahi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shimbun </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Toichiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitotsuyanagi </PERSON> told a news conference he will be succeeded by <PERSON> Toshitada </PERSON> <PERSON> Nakae </PERSON>, currently a managing director, on June 24. <PERSON> Hitotsuyanagi </PERSON> has served as <ORGANIZATION> Asahi </ORGANIZATION> president since December 1984. The newspaper said it has received `` bitter and growing'' complaints from readers about the incident last month, when its cameraman reportedly carved the initials `` KY'' in the surface of a rare underwater coral for a photograph of damage to the reef allegedly caused by private divers. An article accompanying a front-page color photograph of the carved initials in the newspaper's April 20 edition criticized the `` spiritual poverty'' of Japanese who damage the environment. The incident has since received wide coverage in the Japanese press, with several newspapers condemning the <ORGANIZATION> Asahi </ORGANIZATION>. The Asahi has apologized twice editorially for the incident. The reef, 13 feet in height and 66 feet in circumference, is said to be the largest in the world of its species, <PERSON> Galaxea </PERSON> <PERSON> Fascicularis </PERSON>. Located in the southern islands of <LOCATION> Okinawa </LOCATION>, it is designated a protected area by <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Environment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, but some pieces of coral have been broken off by the air tanks of divers, the Asahi article said. Violaters of the Nature Conservation Law are liable for up to six months in jail and a fine of up to $ 714. After a series of protests by local divers, the <ORGANIZATION> Asahi </ORGANIZATION> admitted its photographer intentionally damaged the coral reef. Earlier this month, the newspaper demoted its managing editor and photo department chief in connection with the incident. The photographer has been dismissed.

<HEAD>City Official Draws Protest For Remark on Jews</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A city legislator from an ultrarightist party stirred up a storm of protest Friday when a newspaper quoted him as saying that `` Jews are plundering us again'' and `` something must be done about this.'' West German <ORGANIZATION> ARD </ORGANIZATION> television said the city prosecutor's office had started an investigation against 78-year-old <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Gutjahr </PERSON> for possibly violating German laws with his reported statements. Several members of the city council demanded the resignation of <PERSON> Gutjahr </PERSON>, a 78-year-old member of the rightist <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Germany </ORGANIZATION>, known by its German initials, <ORGANIZATION> NPD </ORGANIZATION>. The NPD, whose views are often likened to those of German neo-Nazi groups, won seven city council seats in local elections in March, giving the ultrarightist party a minority voice in the law-making body. <PERSON> Gutjahr </PERSON>, in an interview printed Friday by the <ORGANIZATION> Frankfurt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Allgemeine </ORGANIZATION> newspaper, was quoted as saying, `` Jews have bought up half of the city.'' According to the newspaper, <PERSON> Gutjahr </PERSON> also said: `` The Jews are plundering us again. Something must be done about this.'' He could not be reached Friday to comment on the newspaper report. <PERSON> Gutjahr </PERSON>, a strident anti-communist, also said he would rather see city property put under government control before more of it is sold to Jewish buyers, the newspaper reported. The elderly councilman denied being anti-Semitic but said he only wants to protect `` German interests,'' it said. The newspaper further quoted him as insulting West German President <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Weizsaecker </PERSON> by calling the liberal-leaning president a `` lump,'' a degrading German word meaning `` limp worthless rag.'' Legislator <PERSON> Jo </PERSON> <PERSON> Meergans </PERSON>, a member of the city's governing <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Gutjahr </PERSON>'s remarks constituted a violation of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s laws against inciting the public. He demanded the <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> prosecutor's office launch an investigation, which the television said had already begun.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> media and production workers went on strike Friday for the third time in 4 -LCB- weeks to demand a 16 percent pay raise that would bring their salaries in line with those in commercial TV and radio. <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION> was forced to cancel some scheduled news and current affairs programs because of the 24-hour strike by about 12,000 workers beginning at midnight. In the earlier walkouts _ on April 24 for 24 hours and May 9-10 for 48 hours _ the unions warned <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION> well in advance. But workers Friday gave only a one-day warning. The dispute involves the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journalists </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trades </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cinematograph </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> and Allied Technicians. Chief union negotiator <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Bolton </PERSON> said employees walked out Friday because the <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION> has refused to reopen contract negotiations or increase their offer of a 7 percent pay increase. Unions say the national average pay for a <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION> journalist is $ 26,860 a year, compared with $ 37,920 in commercial radio or TV. The <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION> says it can not afford more than a 7 percent pay increase. <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION> domestic TV and radio services are funded by licenses collected from 19.3 million owners and renters of TV sets. <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> radio broadcasting is financed by a government grant.

<TEXT>
 The race between <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION> mayoral candidates <PERSON> Suzie </PERSON> <PERSON> Azar </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Elsey </PERSON>, which once turned on issues such as economic development and crime, became personal as Saturday's runoff neared. The two city council members achieved a runoff by defeating four other mayoral candidates in the general election May 6. Mrs. <PERSON> Azar </PERSON> outpolled <PERSON> Elsey </PERSON> 31 percent to 23 percent, but <PERSON> Elsey </PERSON> since has refused to make a public appearance with Mrs. <PERSON> Azar </PERSON> until she reveals how much her family makes from businesses on property they lease from the city near the <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Elsey </PERSON> says Mrs. <PERSON> Azar </PERSON> could face a conflict of interest in votes on airport matters. Under <PERSON> Elsey </PERSON>'s prodding, Mrs. <PERSON> Azar </PERSON> issued a statement saying she and her husband had a net worth of about $ 3.7 million. But she has not revealed how much she and her husband earn from property near the airport, calling <PERSON> Elsey </PERSON>'s questions a smoke screen. <PERSON> Elsey </PERSON>, owner of a medical supply business, lists his net worth at $ 378,875. Since <PERSON> Elsey </PERSON> brought up the income topic two weeks ago, both candidates have ignored issues such as what kinds of businesses to attract, how to reduce crime, whether to raise taxes and how to deal with rapid population growth. Both newspapers have endorsed Mrs. <PERSON> Azar </PERSON>, a Democrat, while outgoing Mayor <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> supports <PERSON> Elsey </PERSON>. By law, <ORGANIZATION> Rogers </ORGANIZATION> had to step down this time after four consecutive two-year terms. If Mrs. <PERSON> Azar </PERSON> wins, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION> will become the fourth of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>' five largest cities to elect a woman mayor. <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION> are all led by women. Unlike most major <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> cities, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION> has a strong mayor and no city manager. The mayor appoints members of city boards and supervises department heads and thus holds the most powerful position in city government.

 An airplane carrying race fans from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION> 500 crashed in a softball field Friday, killing two aboard and injuring three others. The plane, a twin-engine <PERSON> Beechcraft </PERSON> <PERSON> Baron </PERSON>, crashed at about 2:30 p.m. after the pilot notified the <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> he was having `` serious fuel problems,'' said <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Dettmer </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> officials were at the scene investigating the cause of the crash. <LOCATION> Johnson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff <PERSON> Doran </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said the plane was heading for <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION>, 11 miles north of <LOCATION> Greenwood </LOCATION>, for the <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION> 500 on Sunday.

 The USS <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> sailor linked to investigation of the massive explosion aboard the battleship Friday denied wrongdoing and charged the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> was seeking a scapegoat. <PERSON> Kendall </PERSON> <PERSON> Truitt </PERSON>, 21-year-old gunner's mate 3rd class, got high-profile <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> attorney <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> to represent him. <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> warned that continued allegations against <PERSON> Truitt </PERSON>, from homosexuality to that he intentionally caused the explosion that killed 47 sailors April 19, would be `` answered in court.'' <PERSON> Truitt </PERSON> and <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON>, 25-year-old gunner's mate who died in the gun turret blast, were best friends and took out $ 100,000 life insurance policies naming each other as the beneficiaries. <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> investigators have said they are looking into the relationship, including a reported falling-out last year when <PERSON> Truitt </PERSON> was married, as they study homicide as a possibility in the case. `` I think the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> is at a loss,'' <PERSON> Truitt </PERSON> said. `` They're just looking for a scapegoat.'' <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> intelligence had `` leaked the charges to the press little by little'' to create what he called a `` media frenzy.'' He said <PERSON> Truitt </PERSON> had come to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> `` seeking counsel and advice in connection with these vicious, untrue, false and malicious rumors leaked by the intelligence service of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> and transmitted to favored elements of the media. `` They have no evidence,'' he said. `` They do n't even have probable cause.'' <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> said <PERSON> Truitt </PERSON> risked his life to save other sailors after the explosion. <PERSON> Truitt </PERSON> and wife, <PERSON> Carole </PERSON>, joined <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> outside the attorney's law offices for a news conference in which <PERSON> Truitt </PERSON> denied allegations against him. <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> asked if he were a homosexual, which <PERSON> Truitt </PERSON> denied, and then asked <PERSON> Truitt </PERSON>'s wife if he were a good lover. She replied affirmatively. In a later interview on the <ORGANIZATION> NBC-TV </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> network </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> news </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Truitt </PERSON> said he and <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON> `` never had a complete falling-out'' and the two had talked several days before the fatal cruise. `` He was very excited about his new orders'' to work as a driver at the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> embassy in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Truitt </PERSON> said. Thursday, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Truitt </PERSON> was being transferred to the staff commander of Destroyer Squadron eight, in <LOCATION> Mayport </LOCATION> because of the extensive publicity surrounding the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> explosion. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported Thursday that unidentified <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> sources said they found no `` physical evidence indicating the blast was caused by a zmechanical or electrical failure or any other material problem.'' Pentagon spokesman <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said improper storage of the powder had been ruled out as a cause. But <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> said the powder used in the turret where the blast occurred was stored on barges where temperatures reached the 90s and were 25 degrees higher inside the barge. `` Anyone familiar with gunpowder knows it becomes unstable when it gets over 100 degrees,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> reported that unidentified sources said the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> is investigating the possibility that a detonating device was hidden in a burlap patch inserted between bags of powder to clean the barrels of the ship's guns. <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investigative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> agent in <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, said a search of <PERSON> Truitt </PERSON>'s home following the April 19 blast produced one of the burlap patches, adding that it was not tampered with. At Friday's news conference, <PERSON> Truitt </PERSON> said his home had not been searched. <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> said he wanted access to the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> investigation and wanted to go aboard the USS Iowa. He said he was a former <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> commander and is familiar with gun turret operations, as well as with <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> legal procedures. <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> said he was certain there would be no court-martial against <PERSON> Truitt </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Effects of Boston School Plan Debated In Federal Court</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: SUBS 13th graf, `But Garrity...,' to CORRECT total number of

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Lawyers debated in federal court Friday whether a plan to let parents choose their children's schools would reverse years of efforts to integrate <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>'s classrooms. Supporters say the plan, scheduled to take effect this fall for kindergarten, first - and sixth-grade students, would foster competition among schools and improve teaching But a lawyer representing students in a desegregation case dating to 1972 argued that the plan would bring a substantial resegregation of the city's public schools after 15 years of busing for integration. The lawyer, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Atkins </PERSON>, said the plan has merit but needs adjusting. The proposed plan would allow parents to choose their children's schools within three geographical zones, provided rough racial balance is maintained. `` This approach holds great promise in this school district,'' he said. But, he added, `` We believe the very promise the plan represents cautions against a premature, poorly planned start.'' Putting the plan into effect in September `` would have an adverse impact on the students in this school system _ white ones, black ones and other ones,'' <PERSON> Atkins </PERSON> said. Attorney <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Dinger </PERSON>, representing the school committee, argued that the assignment plan was a `` logical extension of desegregation technology employed by the courts in this case.'' Judge <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Garrity </PERSON> listened to the lawyer's arguments and continued the hearing until Tuesday morning after testimony from school committee member <PERSON> Juanita </PERSON> <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> Superintendent <PERSON> Laval </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Garrity </PERSON> presided over the court-ordered desegregation of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>'s schools in the 1970s, when the city was convulsed by protests that sometimes turned violent. <PERSON> Garrity </PERSON> expressed doubt about some of the language of the plan, prompting <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> to say he would support any modifications necessary to prevent misinterpretations. `` I will clearly make sure there is no resegregation. I do n't think there's any way this could occur,'' <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said The school superintendent added that 73 percent of the applications from parents for particular schools had been received, and `` it would be exceedingly disruptive to cancel all those assignments.'' But <PERSON> Garrity </PERSON> said the small percentage of white students in city schools _ about one-quarter of the 57,000 total, according to committee member <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> _ was a subject of concern. `` Unless clear care is taken here, it would be very easy to have a product where every white pupil is in a neighborhood school, and unless those black children would take a bus, the number of racially isolated schools in the city would increase dramatically,'' <PERSON> Garrity </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Caroline </PERSON> <PERSON> Playther </PERSON>, a plaintiff intervener on the behalf of Hispanic parents, also contended that the school assignment plan would adversely affect Hispanic students. <PERSON> Dinger </PERSON> said some students might not be able to attend schools of their choice under the plan, but it would ensure a racially diverse student body in every school, give parents greater control over their children's educations and improve educational quality. `` The plaintiff has submitted no evidence to say the result would be segregation,'' he said. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> testified that she supported the plan despite having questions about the schedule for putting it into effect.

 Now that <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> has won court approval to sell its profitable <ORGANIZATION> Northeast </ORGANIZATION> shuttle to developer <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>, attention is shifting to the rest of the strikebound carrier. The coming week could be critical in <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s 2 -LCB- - month-old Chapter 11 bankruptcy proceeding and how it emerges from one of the most contentious labor disputes in the commercial airline business The committee representing the airline's major creditors is expected to meet during the week, and a hearing is scheduled for Thursday in federal bankruptcy court on the issue of appointing a special trustee to run Eastern. `` Next week could be a very significant decision point,'' <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashlock </PERSON> said Friday from the airline's <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> headquarters. Two investor groups had submitted formal buyout proposals for Eastern before <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Bankruptcy Judge <PERSON> Burton </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lifland </PERSON> approved the $ 365 million shuttle sale to Trump on Thursday. The groups, one headed by former <ORGANIZATION> Piedmont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> and the other by <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> commodities trader <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Ritchie </PERSON>, are expected to present new financing plans in the coming week for Eastern minus the shuttle, union representatives say. Even before the shuttle sale, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON>, court-appointed examiner for Eastern, had said the <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ritchie </PERSON> groups would have to put up more cash in their purchase proposals. Discussions between the investor groups and union representatives were planned for the Memorial Day holiday weekend. The unions' goal is for Eastern to be sold to a new owner and resume operations by July 1, said <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashby </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> pilots union. Eastern sought bankruptcy court refuge March 9, five days after the start of a strike that grounded most of its flights. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s parent <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, plans to rebuild <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> as a smaller carrier and sell another $ 1.4 billion worth of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> assets besides the shuttle. The bankruptcy court, which must sanction any plan, has not passed judgment on <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>'s strategy, although Eastern has been making deals for the sale of aircraft, landing slots and other assets in the event the plan is approved. At its meeting, the creditors' committee is expected to evaluate <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>'s plan and, possibly, the revised <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ritchie </PERSON> proposals, sources close to the situation said. On Thursday, <PERSON> Lifland </PERSON> is scheduled to hear arguments on the unions' request that a powerful trustee be appointed to run <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, which would remove the airline from <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>'s control. The company has opposed such a move.

 A temporary bridge collapsed Friday, plunging as many as four autos into the swollen <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, and the people inside were feared dead. A child was found dead in a creek flooded by the same heavy rains. Widespread flooding in southwestern <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> sent people scurrying to rooftops and high ground. One couple and their 10-year-old son were stranded on the roof of their house from morning until 5:30 p.m. when rescuers reached them by boat, the <ORGANIZATION> Butler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sheriff </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said. In <LOCATION> Camden </LOCATION>, rescuers used lifelines and boats to lead 30 occupants of a trailer park through chest-high water to safety. A total of 200 people were forced from their homes in the town of about 1,900 people southwest of <LOCATION> Dayton </LOCATION>. Divers recovered the body of 20-month-old <PERSON> Brandon </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Irwin </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Donnels </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION>, northeast of <LOCATION> Dayton </LOCATION>, about 7:30 p.m., the sheriff's department said. Four hours earlier, authorities received a report that <PERSON> Brandon </PERSON> wandered away from his grandmother, fell into the creek from a bridge and was swept out of her reach. Sheriff's Lt. <PERSON> Vaughn </PERSON> <PERSON> McKenney </PERSON> said two helicopters helped rescuers search for the boy. Swift currents and the danger of floating debris prevented rescuers from going into the river where the bridge collapsed near <LOCATION> Miamitown </LOCATION>, about seven miles east of <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>, authorities said. Witnesses gave varying accounts of two to four vehicles falling into the river, said <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, chief of the <ORGANIZATION> Colerain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Township </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. Radio station <ORGANIZATION> WCKY </ORGANIZATION> reported at least six people were missing. An adult and four children were seen in a yellow pickup truck and at least one person in a car which went under the water, WCKY reported. <LOCATION> Hamilton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff's Lt. Col. <PERSON> Ramon </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffbauer </PERSON>, when asked if anyone could have survived a plunge into the river said, `` I would n't think so.'' `` The current is moving pretty fast. I ca n't tell you how fast, but the rescue crews did n't go into the water at all,'' <PERSON> Hoffbauer </PERSON> said. A 100-foot section of the center of the one-lane bridge fell about 10 feet into the river at 5:27 p.m., <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. The bridge was about 300 feet long. Tires, tree tops and barrels could be seen floating in the river, but no vehicles were sighted, and they were presumed to have floated downstream, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. The river was at 19 feet, three feet above flood stage, and was expected to crest at 23 feet Saturday morning, said <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, director of disaster services for the <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> chapter of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> heard from several people who said relatives had not arrived home on schedule Friday night, he said. The temporary bridge, built to carry traffic on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> 52 during construction of a permanent span, collapsed when wooden supports that held the roadway deck failed, said <LOCATION> Hamilton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Engineer <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Schramm </PERSON>. <PERSON> Schramm </PERSON> said the contractor that built the bridge called the engineer's office about 10 minutes before the collapse and suggested closing the span because of debris in the water. <PERSON> Schramm </PERSON> said an order was issued immediately, but the collapse occurred before barricades could be set up. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Wells </PERSON> said he crossed the bridge just before it collapsed. `` I turned around and looked. I saw the back of a car going in. A couple more sections of the bridge fell after that,'' he said. The flooding in <LOCATION> Camden </LOCATION> was caused when a two-hour downpour pushed the <LOCATION> Sevenmile </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> beyond its banks and into low-lying areas. `` It was scary,'' said Assistant Fire Chief <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Steele </PERSON>. `` To some individuals, they have lost everything. We do have trailers that have been washed off their foundations.'' He said water was 5 feet deep in some houses. Firefighter <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Ball </PERSON> said he and others rescued about 30 people in a trailer park near the creek by trying rope from the trailers to trees. Evacuees clung to the rope as they waded through the floodwaters to boats. <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinstiger </PERSON>, one of the people rescued from the trailer park, said the water was chest-deep as he made his way to safety with the rope. A firefighter carried his 1-year-old daughter in his jacket. `` It's kind of scary when you have a baby,'' <PERSON> Weinstiger </PERSON> said. Another resident, <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON>, said he carried an elderly woman from her house. He said he chained his car to a tree to keep it from floating away. Six families were flooded out of their homes in <LOCATION> Butler </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, also in southwestern <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, said sheriff's dispatcher <PERSON> Diana </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON>. The Butler evacuees stayed with friends and relatives, Ms. <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON> said. Most of the <LOCATION> Camden </LOCATION> evacuees were sent to an elementary school, but all had left by late morning when floodwaters began to recede.

<HEAD>German Leftist Militants, Police Clash At Squatters' Camp</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HAMBURG, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Riot police used water cannon to battle rock-throwing leftist militants on Friday at an illegal squatters' camp near <LOCATION> Hamburg </LOCATION>'s waterfront. No injuries were reported immediately. Some of the rundown trailers that made up the camp caught fire during the melee, sending up a thick cloud of black smoke. Fighting broke out after police ordered the leftists to remove 15 camping and construction trailers they had set up in the Hafenstrasse area this year. The leftists towed away 10 trailers, but left five behind and announced they would resist authorities' efforts to clear the area. Thousands of people _ protesters and onlookers _ gathered at the site as riot police and federal border police ringed the area with armored vehicles and water cannon. About 2,500 officers were ordered to the site or put on standby. According to police reports, militants fired flare guns and threw rocks at police. Four trailers suddenly caught fire _ cause of which is yet to be determined _ and the press of people kept firemen from reaching the site. Police then turned on water cannon and moved in to clear the area. Leftists and their sympathizers are occupying abandoned buildings in the Hafenstrasse area. Officials have been trying to find ways to evict them and still avoid a violent showdown.

 Former Sen. <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Magnuson </PERSON> was eulogized Thursday as a good friend, skilled politician and powerful leader who never forgot to represent the powerless. About 1,000 mourners filled St. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cathedral </ORGANIZATION> here to speak kind words and swap stories about `` <PERSON> Maggie </PERSON>,'' the low-key, personable workhorse who was among the century's most powerful senators. `` He was a marvelous example of how public power can be linked to public good,'' House Majority Leader <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, D-Wash., said in a reflection on <PERSON> Magnuson </PERSON>'s life <PERSON> Magnuson </PERSON>, a Democrat whose congressional career spanned 44 years, died Saturday at his <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> home of congestive heart failure, brought on by his long fight with diabetes.

 Former Rep. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> negotiated for a month or more to borrow what he thought was drug money and later lied about it to a federal grand jury, a prosecutor said Thursday. Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Gillen </PERSON> said during opening arguments in <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON>'s perjury trial that videotapes and other evidence will show that <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON>, seeking an $ 850,000 loan, was told the deal violated banking laws, was told narcotics money was involved and was urged to walk away by the undercover agent but `` never terminated the deal.'' <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON>'s attorneys argued that <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> and the government were both duped by a manipulative associate of the former <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> congressman. <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> is accused of lying under oath in early 1988 to a federal grand jury investigating his dealings with <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> LeChasney </PERSON>, an associate and convicted money launderer, and with federal agent <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Mullaney </PERSON>, who was posing as `` <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>,'' a money broker for probable drug dealers. <PERSON> Gillen </PERSON> told jurors that the agent more than once told <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> that if he were troubled by the illegal nature of the proposed deal he could walk away. `` The agent is almost beating him off with a stick,'' the prosecutor said. Still, <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> sought the money and even turned over to his contractor a check for $ 150,000 before later canceling the loan deal, <PERSON> Gillen </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> `` did not give a damn where the money came from,'' <PERSON> Gillen </PERSON> said. In his opening argument, defense attorney <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Hendrix </PERSON> said <PERSON> LeChasney </PERSON> tried to fool <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> into believing the deal was legitimate. <PERSON> Hendrix </PERSON> said <PERSON> LeChasney </PERSON> repeatedly told <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> that the deal involved legitimate money coming from foreign investors while he told <PERSON> Mullaney </PERSON> that <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> was `` a crook.'' <PERSON> Mullaney </PERSON>, the first witness called by the prosecution Thursday afternoon, testified that <PERSON> LeChasney </PERSON> told him that the congressman `` did n't care where the money came from; he wanted at least $ 750,000.'' <PERSON> Mullaney </PERSON> also said he was interested in meeting <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> to investigate whether <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON>'s plans to sell a $ 1 million note at a discount for cash `` would lead to an evasion of his income taxes'' and violations of currency laws. <PERSON> Hendrix </PERSON>, however, told the jury that <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> never agreed to the deal, that he continued to shop for and ultimately acquired other financing for his luxurious suburban home in <LOCATION> Stone </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> and that the check he received from <PERSON> LeChasney </PERSON> was a separate transaction he canceled after becoming suspicious. <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> was indicted Oct. 17 on 10 counts of lying to a federal grand jury, each of which carries a penalty of 10 months to five years in prison. The two-term congressman lost his 4th District seat in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>'s eastern suburbs to Democrat <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> last November An attempt at a speedy trial before Election Day was aborted after two jurors received <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> campaign material in the mail.

 Rain that fell Thursday in southern <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> missed a grass fire that has burned 81,100 acres of Everglades National Park, and more flare-ups were reported, dashing firefighters' hopes they could confine the blaze. `` The southwest corner is giving us problems this evening,'' said park spokeswoman <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Tolle </PERSON>. `` There was rain, and a little bit of hail, but also lightning.'' About 250 firefighters from as far away as <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> have fought the blaze, which was started by lightning May 16 in the region's worst fire season in a decade, she said. About 60 firefighters returned to fire lines Thursday to tend hot spots and secure fire lines. Officials earlier predicted the fire would move toward a sparse area with poor fuel, and had not expected any lightning. `` The direction it's going is very sparse and poor fuel, and it's also wetter in that area so we're very optimistic we're just going to be able to put a circle around it,'' Ms. <PERSON> Tolle </PERSON> said. While showers fell 30 miles to the northeast in the <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> area, no rain fell on the fire, which is located in marshy sawgrass and isolated hardwood hammocks that had n't burned in more than 30 years. The blaze is typical of fires before the rainy season in the vast park and has caused only limited damage, Ms. <PERSON> Tolle </PERSON> said. `` It's burning off the top of the grass,'' she said. `` We'll see, as soon as the summer rains begin, there'll be a lush regrowth of the sawgrass. The fire briefly threatened the Miccosukee Indian village at the northern edge of the park Tuesday before shifting direction, but the park's nearby <LOCATION> Shark </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> visitor center was closed until Thursday morning because of heavy smoke. State officials estimate about 400 wildfires have consumed 350,000 acres of grass and brush in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> since October. `` Probably as far as acreage lost, this will end up topping the others'' in this decade, said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Utley </PERSON>, state Forestry Division district administrator. He estimated two-thirds of the fires have been caused by man.

<HEAD>Trainmaster Says Wrong Engineer Took Charge Before Derailment</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The engineer who decided to stop a freight train on a steep slope and disconnect the locomotives, causing a derailment and explosion, did n't have the authority to do so, a railroad official testified Thursday. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Lemm </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Montana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rail </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Link </ORGANIZATION>'s trainmaster at <LOCATION> Helena </LOCATION>, said engineer <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Estes </PERSON> was not in charge of the 49-car train when he ordered the engines detached and realigned because the lead locomotive had lost power and heat. <PERSON> Lemm </PERSON> testified on the second day of a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> hearing into an accident that knocked out electricity in <LOCATION> Helena </LOCATION> on Feb. 2, when it was 27 degrees below zero and the wind chill was about 70 below. <PERSON> Estes </PERSON> was engineer of three `` helper'' locomotives assigned to assist the train over the mountains at the Continental Divide. <PERSON> Jody </PERSON> <PERSON> McCloud </PERSON>, engineer of the train itself, did not want to realign the locomotives, but did not challenge <PERSON> Estes </PERSON>' decision. He offered to run the train from the cold lead locomotive, but <PERSON> Estes </PERSON> rejected the idea. While the locomotives were detached, the train began rolling down the track 11 miles into <LOCATION> Helena </LOCATION> where it collided with other locomotives. Several cars derailed and two carrying hydrogen peroxide and isopropyl alcohol were involved in an explosion that shattered windows for miles and severed power lines. About 3,500 residents were evacuated, but there were no serious injuries. Damage has been estimated at $ 10 million. The disagreement between <PERSON> Estes </PERSON> and <PERSON> McCloud </PERSON> was detailed in testimony by the two men Wednesday. <PERSON> Lemm </PERSON> was quizzed about the issue Thursday. `` I believe Mr. <PERSON> McCloud </PERSON> was in charge of that train,'' he told <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> officials. While <PERSON> Estes </PERSON> may have been controlling the train from his `` helper'' locomotive, <PERSON> McCloud </PERSON> was responsible for the train itself and had the discretion to assume control, <PERSON> Lemm </PERSON> said. Also testifying Thursday was <PERSON> Fritz </PERSON> <PERSON> Zettel </PERSON>, hazardous materials specialist for the <ORGANIZATION> Helena </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. He complained of problems in obtaining details on the cargo in some of the derailed cars. He also recounted problems the city had with emergency communications during the power outage, and said the railroad should involve city officials more in developing their plans for train accidents. The final <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> report on the accident is not expected until late this year.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> skipper's wife who narrowly escaped injury in the bombing of her van, said Thursday that the incident showed terrorism knows no boundaries. `` It made us all realize that no nation or people can be immune from terrorist activity, whatever the source,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> said in a speech to a fund-raising luncheon of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> Crime Stoppers. Mrs. <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> said she understood many people stood on the street and stared at her burned-out van and asked, `` How could it happen? How could it happen here?'' `` That's what a terrorist wants us to do, to create unreasoned fear, isolation ... and forced modification of our lifestyles,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> said. `` But determination in our hearts to ensure that this does not occur turns a terrorist victory into defeat. A unified community is an aware community and the execution of crime becomes much more difficult.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>, who has made few public appearances since the March 10 bombing, was among five women whose lives have been torn by violent crime to address the luncheon. Crime Stoppers is administering the $ 40,000 reward fund established in the case of the van bombing, which occurred at a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> intersection as Mrs. <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> drove to work alone. She got out just as flames engulfed the vehicle. Authorities suspect the attack may have been in retaliation for the mistaken downing last July of an Iranian airliner by the <LOCATION> USS </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION>, commanded by Capt. Will <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>. All 290 people aboard the jetliner were killed when the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION>, engaged in a surface skirmish with Iranian gunboats, fired two missiles at what it thought was an attacking Iranian fighter jet. Mrs. <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> did not discuss her dismissal from her teaching job at a private school whose officials were worried students and staff might be caught in terrorism's crossfire. Mrs. <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> accepted a $ 135,000 cash settlement from the school in exchange for leaving the job she held for 12 years, but says she wants to continue teaching and is looking for a job. Her husband is scheduled to be relieved as <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> skipper in change of command ceremonies Saturday. <ORGANIZATION> Rogers </ORGANIZATION>' new assignment is at the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Tactical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Training </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> on <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Loma </LOCATION>.

 <LOCATION> Seabrook </LOCATION> nuclear power plant officials expressed joy Thursday on winning approval to split their first atoms within two weeks, after a decade of delays and billions of dollars in cost overruns. Plant foes, who lost a three-year battle to block low-power testing, promised to press their legal battle against commercial operation of the $ 6 billion plant. `` We still have a long fight ahead of us,'' said <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Attorney General <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON>, whose state played a key role in stalling <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON> by refusing to cooperate in evacuation planning for it. The anti-nuclear <ORGANIZATION> Clamshell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>, which has organized demonstrations against <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON> since the first trees were cleared in 1976, continued preparing for a major rally the first weekend in June, possibly coinciding with the first atomic chain reaction at the reactor. A federal appeals court in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Thursday rejected <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON> foes' request to delay the tests, and the <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> said it would issue the low-power license Friday morning. <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON> officials said they would start preparing for the tests as soon as they got the license, and could be ready to start nuclear fission about 10 days later. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, president of <LOCATION> Seabrook </LOCATION> operator <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yankee </ORGANIZATION>, said the low-power license `` marks a milestone for <LOCATION> Seabrook </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Station </LOCATION> and forecasts a promising energy future for all of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>.'' Most of the plant's 1,400 workers had already gone home by the time the court ruled, <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Sher </PERSON> said, `` but for those people seen here there were certainly a lot of smiles and congratulations.'' New Hampshire Gov. <PERSON> Judd </PERSON> <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON>, who conditionally supports <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON>, reiterated his belief that starting low-power tests before commercial operation is assured `` is probably not a good business decision.'' `` They should wait until they're closer to a final disposition on the full-power license,'' <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. `` There are still a lot of legal challenges still lying in the road as well as some major decisions to be made by the <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>'' and its licensing board. But <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> said he did not take legal action to try to block the tests because lead <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON> owner <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION> has agreed not to charge ratepayers any costs associated with the tests. In a statement, the <ORGANIZATION> Clamshell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> `` does not yet fully realize the political burden he must now carry for his complicit silence in allowing this radioactive testing to occur, nor do any of us fully realize the environmental burden we will pass on to future generations with the radioactive waste, for which there is no known disposal.'' About 10 Clamshell members, holding signs saying `` Stop Seabrook Now,'' gathered outside <PERSON> Seabrook </PERSON>'s gates as the court issued its ruling. <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> complained that `` the plant will now be contaminated even though the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> has made no final decision on the adequacy of the <LOCATION> Seabrook </LOCATION> evacuation plan.'' `` There is still no adequate plan to evacuate people in the event of an accident, nor is there any evidence that such a plan can even be produced,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said in a statement in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>.

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials say they hope immediate trade talks can open markets in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and avert any backlash in those countries over being named to the administration's list of top trade violators. `` This exercise is not intended to be offensive,'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Trade Representative <PERSON> Carla </PERSON> <PERSON> A </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hills </PERSON> told a news conference Thursday night as she announced the administration is targeting those countries for priority action under the 1988 trade law. `` I hope there is no backlash.'' The 1988 Omnibus Trade Act requires the administration to issue what amounts to a hit list that names the countries whose trade barriers are most harmful to American producers. The government then has 18 months to negotiate away the barriers. Failure of the talks could lead for tariffs of up to 100 percent on selected exports from the offending countries.

<TEXT>
 Before <PERSON> Martika </PERSON> could even speak, she was thinking about singing and dancing. `` I feel like I've done it before, probably in a previous life'' explained the 20-year-old singer and actress, who has released her self-titled debut album. `` I think when I came out ofmy mother's womb I was ready to be a performer Most people do n't have that. I can never explain why. God only knows.'' Born <PERSON> Marta </PERSON> <PERSON> Marrero </PERSON>, she began dance classes at 4 and was soon giving recitals at school. <PERSON> Martika </PERSON>, the daughter of <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> immigrants, also paid close attention to the new phenonema of music videos on television. `` Yeah, it was big,'' she recalled. `` I grew up on <ORGANIZATION> MTV </ORGANIZATION>. When I was 14, <ORGANIZATION> MTV </ORGANIZATION> was taking off. That's when I got into pop. Culture Club, <PERSON> Duran </PERSON> <PERSON> Duran </PERSON> and <PERSON> Madonna </PERSON> came out.'' Impatient to break into show business, <PERSON> Martika </PERSON> was calling agents at age 11; she had no interest in pursuing a conventional career. `` I have friends who say, ` I hate my job. I wish I could do something else.' I say, ` Go do it.' I really believe you should follow your heart even if you have to go through rough times. `` I know I wanted it badly enough, I would have starved for it. Better that than making a lot of money in an office and being unhappy for the rest of my life.'' Rock singer <PERSON> Madonna </PERSON> would prove to be a major influence on the aspiring star, who admired her determination to succeed. `` <PERSON> Madonna </PERSON>'s been really inspirational for me because she took herself from nothing to the hugest female pop star alive. She introduced the whole dance music scene. She paved the way for the rest of us. People still do n't take her seriously, but she's still making records.'' <PERSON> Martika </PERSON> also chose to professionally use just one name, but denied getting the idea from <PERSON> Madonna </PERSON>. Afterall, <PERSON> Cher </PERSON> had done it before. `` Even when I was younger, I thought it would be cool to have one name, to have a unique name like <PERSON> Martika </PERSON>,'' the singer said. `` I started using it when I was 16. I was acting, and my agent said I should save having one name for my recording career. Casting directors would complain to the agencies that I did n't have a last name.'' <PERSON> Martika </PERSON> landed a minor role in the 1982 film version of `` Annie.'' She went on to appear on several television shows, including `` Silver Spoons,'' `` Diff ` rent Strokes,'' `` <ORGANIZATION> Hardcastle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> McCormick </PERSON>'' and the children's variety series, `` Kids Incorporated When she turned 18, she set her sights on the music industry, spending a year preparing songs with producer-writer <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> -LRB- <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> Sound Machine, <PERSON> Stephanie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mills </PERSON> -RRB-. She needed just two months to record the album, a collection of dance tracks and ballads. The first single, `` More Than You Know,'' reached the Top 20, but <PERSON> Martika </PERSON>'s favorite song on the album is the anti-drug `` Toy Soldiers,'' which she wrote herself. `` I was a little hesitant because I had only written two songs before and they were light songs. I came up to <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> and said I wanted to write about drugs. It was the first time I got the nerve to write about something that was scary for me to talk about, so I did,'' she said. <PERSON> Martika </PERSON> wrote the song about a friend who had been addicted to cocaine. `` He ca n't listen to it,'' she said. `` It gives him the chills. He says it affects him too much. He knows it's about him. He loves it. he thinks it's a beautiful song, but when he listens to my record, he skips over that.'' <PERSON> Martika </PERSON> also does a dance version of <PERSON> Carole </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>'s `` I Feel the Earth Move.'' The young singer was just 3 when <PERSON> King </PERSON>'s classic `` Tapestry'' album was released and knew little about her work. `` I listened to the melody once and put it away because I did n't want to be influenced by her performance I wanted to do it my way,'' she said. `` Doing a remnake, you get the opportunity to revive something for the older generation but you can also introduce a great old song to kids who never knew it existed.'' Fans should be warned that <PERSON> Martika </PERSON> does not expect to stay in music very long. Although she considers singing her first great love, <PERSON> Martika </PERSON> would eventually like to concentrate on movies. `` I think an actor can grow old a bit more gracefully,'' she explained. `` I see myself doing pop music while I have the energy and then getting married and doing one film every year or two. There are so many parts of me outside of <PERSON> Martika </PERSON> the singer. There's a real person in here somewhere.''

 When <PERSON> Margie </PERSON> <PERSON> Moberg </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> complained to her husband about poor city services, he challenged her to do something about it. The 49-year-old real estate agent, mother of five and grandmother of five, now is nine months into a term as mayor of her financially ailing hometown, a Mobile suburb suffering from nearly two decades of white flight. <PERSON> Prichard </PERSON>'s 38,000 residents _ 78 percent of them black _ have an average income of $ 12,000 to $ 15,000. Unemployment is 13.5 percent, compared with 11.5 percent a year ago. Its 800 units of public housing have a waiting list and <LOCATION> Wilson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Avenue </LOCATION>, the main street, is lined with boarded-up businesses. `` I am determined to see this city cleaned up,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, who has urged residents to bring solutions, not complaints to City Hall. Offsetting her determination is the cold reality of economics. <PERSON> Prichard </PERSON> has n't had a printed budget since 1972, but <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Longino </PERSON>, the finance director Mrs. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> hired, said it will be $ 488,000 in the red this year. The city has been operating without insurance since last year. `` When you ride through downtown <PERSON> Prichard </PERSON>, you see that there is very little if any real type of retail or any other services that are generating a taxable base that would allow the city to start to grow again,'' said <PERSON> Floyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Pough </PERSON>, who works in a community assistance program. Whites began moving out with the election of the first of three black mayors, Democrat <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>, in 1972. As whites moved out, poor blacks from north Mobile began moving in. <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> resigned in 1980, convinced that blacks had taken control of `` their own destiny,'' which had been his goal. The `` mass exodus by whites that threw the situation out of balance'' still continues, said the Rev. <ORGANIZATION> J.J. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Phillips </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sinai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>. He said the challenge remains poverty and the white flight that took business with it. `` Black people want the same things as whites _ nice homes, good jobs,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, who is white. She eked out a 3,144-3 ,050 victory over <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Norwood </PERSON>, a black Democrat, in a runoff election in September after he defeated two-term <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> incumbent <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> The job pays $ 35,000 a year. `` <PERSON> Prichard </PERSON> is still <PERSON> Prichard </PERSON>,'' regardless of who is mayor, <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> said. Real estate agent <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Buchman </PERSON>, said Mrs. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> has n't been in office long enough to judge. `` She has on one or two occasions mentioned some things, but they are in the formatives stages and it's difficult to talk about.'' It's not possible to counter poverty `` until such time as they see some change in the neighborhood situation,'' <PERSON> Buchman </PERSON> said. Many of the residents of a large part of the city are on welfare and `` most of the households are headed by women with children.'' Employed residents, including the new mayor, tend to live in the part of the city known as Eight Mile. And regardless of who's in City Hall, he said, it must address the areas that are `` drug-infested and have no money. `` The inner city is where the problem lies. Inner-city crime, and I do n't know how we're going to stop that.'' <PERSON> Pough </PERSON> lived in <PERSON> Prichard </PERSON> for 27 years, but moved to Mobile in 1980 to buy a house that would not decline in value. `` Not many people want to live in a city where you have a high rate of unemployment, and you're not getting services from the city in terms of police protection,'' he said. His agency can help the poor and homeless in the short term, `` but you get people who are out saying, ` I need to work. Can you help me?' ... Once you get people who ca n't find affordable housing, and jobs that will pay them a decent salary to get off welfare rolls, to work on a daily basis, they are trapped.'' Residents expect to see some revitalization from the new administration, said <PERSON> Pough </PERSON>. `` I guess what they're looking for is a new beginning. From a black administration to a person who is white, female, they are looking for something that's different from the past.''

<TEXT>
 East German claims to channel waters off this lucrative Polish port have been fraying the `` frontier of friendship'' that separates the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc neighbors since 1985 but the door now is open to a solution. <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> have signed an agreement to readjust their borders with the aim of settling once and for all a dispute that was given scant official public attention but became an open secret on the piers of the Baltic coast. Because of the dispute, both sides put border guards in place on the wide beach west of the port and signs warned strollers. Marking buoys were set out in the channel, which winds back and forth from the high seas to the port. The port of Swinoujscie straddles the narrow opening of a bay that leads to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s largest port, <LOCATION> Szczecin </LOCATION>, 40 miles to the south on the Odra -LRB- Oder in German -RRB- <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. The conflict erupted after <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> extended its territorial waters to 12 miles from shore in 1985 and started to enforce its claim to parts of the channel approach to <LOCATION> Swinoujscie </LOCATION> that had been under Polish administration. The agreement aimed at solving the frictions was signed May 22 in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> by the Polish and East German foreign ministers. Essentially, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> agreed to abandon most of its territorial claims where they intersected the shipping lanes to and from the Polish port. In exchange, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> gets fishing rights in part of the bay. Only part of the westernmost approach to the bay will remain waters of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, which promises not to disturb Polish ship traffic there. `` The agreement is a common success for both states,'' said the chief Polish negotiator, <PERSON> Wladyslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Napieraj </PERSON>, in an official statement. A few years ago, <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> German </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> guard </ORGANIZATION> cutters had closed in on ships that allegedly strayed out of Polish waters, warning them over bullhorns they were violating East German territory, said <PERSON> Jozef </PERSON> <PERSON> Chabowski </PERSON>, a department director at the Polish shipping company. `` We were facing the problem that <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> said we were operating on waters they claim do n't belong to us, so the issue must be settled. It was a show -LRB- of authority -RRB- from their side to the ships,'' he said. But he added that the incidents have been less frequent in the past year. The dispute arose at about the time <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> had made public plans to open a duty-free zone in <LOCATION> Swinoujscie-Szczecin </LOCATION>, while <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> was investing heavily to build up its <LOCATION> Baltic </LOCATION> port at <LOCATION> Rostock </LOCATION>, 80 miles to the west. <PERSON> Jozef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stebnicki </PERSON> of the maritime office that handles shipping complaints said recreational sailing craft had been affected, and <PERSON> Boleslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Stolowicz </PERSON>, chairman of the Certa fish cooperative, said it was a problem for deep-sea fishing companies. Talks at the highest level on the dispute took place last June when <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s Gen. <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> met <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>, the East German leader, in the former German city of <LOCATION> Wroclaw </LOCATION>. A government spokesman at that time said an agreement was near. `` We here in the western territories of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> are especially sensitive to these problems because of the most recent history,'' said <PERSON> Jerzy </PERSON> <PERSON> Timen </PERSON>, an editor at the Szczecin-based weekly newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Morze </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> I </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ziemia </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- Sea and Earth -RRB-. <PERSON> Timen </PERSON>, who has written extensively on the dispute, said Polish authorities were not interested in heating up the conflict and that officials censored articles in his newspaper that tried to put the conflict in a national and international context. `` Everyone was talking about it, but articles did n't appear _ although you could sneak certain problems into professional or factory publications,'' he said. But Polish underground newspapers from the area reported extensively on the dispute and said that Polish vessels at one point were being stopped and inspected by East Germans. Just after World War II, the area around Swinoujscie-Szczecin, previously German, was turned over to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. The German towns of <LOCATION> Swinemuende </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Stettin </LOCATION> became Swinoujscie and <LOCATION> Szczecin </LOCATION>. Resident Germans were forced to leave, while Polish refugees were moved in after having been expelled by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> from what before the war had been the eastern part of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. As relations between <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> improved in the 1970s, Poles and East Germans only had to show national identity cards to cross the border. Poles flocked to <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> to shop at its better stocked stores. But after the rise of the independent Solidarity trade union in 1980-81, East Germans required Poles to use passports and issued Poles entrance visas only on the basis of an invitation. Now the majority of Germans in the restaurants and on the beaches are tourists from <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, only a two-hour drive away, who benefit from the exchange rate that allows them, among other things, to eat a first-rate dinner for the equivalent of only about $ 10.

<HEAD>Portugal Still Wary of Spain, Although Ties Are Stronger</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LISBON, Portugal (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>. The names often are said in one breath, and today there are even more reasons to group the Iberian neighbors together. But many Portuguese dislike it. Feeling overshadowed by bigger, richer <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Portuguese </LOCATION> point to the differences between them. `` There is a division, a looking at <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> as the enemy,'' said <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Brito </PERSON> <PERSON> Soares </PERSON>, an economics professor at <LOCATION> Lisbon </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's in the cultural background.'' He cites an old <LOCATION> Portuguese </LOCATION> saying: `` De Espanha ni bom vento, ni bom casamento'' _ From <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, neither good wind nor good marriage. Said <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Racich </PERSON>, an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> banker who has lived in both countries: `` There is always a sense of competition and wariness among the Portuguese toward Spaniards.'' Spaniard <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Hay </PERSON>, a director of <ORGANIZATION> Banco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hispano </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Americano </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION>, said: `` <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> was always a bit obsessed with <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>. The Portuguese always define themselves as something different than <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>.'' Spaniards do n't seem to spend much time thinking about the Portuguese, and <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Campos </PERSON> e <PERSON> Cunha </PERSON>, another <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> professor, agrees. `` We talk much more about them than they talk about us.'' The prejudices are typical of large and small neighbors: many <LOCATION> Portuguese </LOCATION> think Spaniards are loud and overbearing; many Spaniards think Portuguese are insecure and backward. Seafaring nations, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> traditionally have had little to do with each other, although they share the <LOCATION> Iberian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION>, are n't divided by mountains or rivers, and do n't need passports to cross the border. `` <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> was always a little country against a big one. During centuries <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> had to defend itself against the <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> desire to annex <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Barciela </PERSON>, a Madrid-based correspondent for <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>'s main newspaper, Diaro de Noticias. <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> ruled <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> for only 60 years, until 1640, but the <LOCATION> Portuguese </LOCATION> have `` never gotten over that,'' <PERSON> Racich </PERSON> said. The Portuguese still boast that their country was the only Iberian region ultimately to escape Castilian control. To escape Spanish domination, <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> formed a strong bond with <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, and created a culture so independent of <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> that today it remains almost impervious to its neighbor's influence, <PERSON> Barciela </PERSON> said. But the relationship changed dramatically when the two joined the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> in 1986. It forced traditionally protectionist <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> to start dropping its trade barriers. That means <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> now buys more products from others countries, including <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>, whose trade-based economy traditionally has been more open. With the approach of 1992, when the 12 nations of the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> open up trade among themselves, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> has been investing more in <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>. It invested $ 119 million in <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> in 1988, five times the 1985 amount. Portuguese investment in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> is still insignificant. `` In five years' time, there will exist an Iberian economy, not just a <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> economy,'' said <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Capelo </PERSON>, director of capital markets for <ORGANIZATION> Banco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> do </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Funchal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SA </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Lisbon </LOCATION>. `` I believe <ORGANIZATION> Iberia </ORGANIZATION> will be much more integrated.'' Portuguese exports to <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> almost quadrupled to $ 1.3 billion in 1988 from 1985, while Spanish exports to <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> almost trebled to $ 2.2 billion, according to the <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> government. Tourism has grown, with millions of travelers going in both directions each year. But there are problems. It's still `` very difficult for any <LOCATION> Portuguese </LOCATION> product to get into <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Jaime </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Lacerda </PERSON>, director of the Confederation of Portuguese Industry. `` There are some fears that the <LOCATION> Portuguese </LOCATION> economy can be swallowed by Spanish enterprises,'' he added. `` In <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>, all this Spanish investment is seen as dangerous from a point of view of its identity.'' Some Portuguese are worried that their government's new privatization program will result in Spaniards buying up the maximum foreign holdings allowed in the sales of state-owned companies. <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> is about five times the size of <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>. Its population of 38.8 million is more than triple <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>'s. With per capita gross domestic product of about $ 7,400, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> is twice as prosperous. `` In <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, economically and in terms of mindset, they are 10 years ahead of <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Racich </PERSON>, the American banker. `` <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> is a gleaming modern capital, <LOCATION> Lisbon </LOCATION> is a very large village.'' They also keep different hours. Both take long lunches but at different times, which could be an annoyance in an intermeshed economy. The Portuguese start theirs at 1 p.m. and return around 2:30 or 3. The Spaniards start at 2:30 and return at 4:30 or 5. The Portuguese end the work day at 6 p.m. and the Spaniards around 7 or 8 p.m. The languages are very different. The Portuguese generally can understand spoken Spanish, but most Spaniards ca n't understand Portuguese. Portuguese radio plays Spanish music and the Portuguese who can afford it have dishes that receive Spanish TV. But the fare of Portuguese-speaking <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is more popular. `` People have a misconception that <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> is a macho country,'' says <PERSON> Cunha </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Portuguese </LOCATION> women's participation in the work force is one of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s highest, although primarily through menial agricultural jobs, while <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> women's is the lowest. A woman, <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Pintasilgo </PERSON>, was briefly <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>'s prime minister in 1979-1980.

<HEAD>Plans for Europe in 1992 Stirs Protest in French Caribbean</HEAD>

 <LOCATION> FORT-DE-FRANCE </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Martinique </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s move toward a single trading market by the end of 1992 has raised some concern on <LOCATION> Martinique </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Guadeloupe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> islands 4,500 miles from <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. A fear is that the elimination of trade barriers within the 12-nation <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> will trigger an invasion of wealthy land speculators and jobless immigrants that could threaten the islands' <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> identity. On May 1, Labor Day, hundreds of trade unionists poured into the streets of <LOCATION> Fort-de-France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Martinique </LOCATION>'s capital, to voice their concern over the `` dangers of European integration,'' as one official put it. Protesters maintained that removing tariffs on European goods coming into <LOCATION> Martinique </LOCATION> will stifle local production and the unrestricted circulation of capital will make it easier for Europeans to buy land and businesses on the island. <PERSON> Emmanuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ibene </PERSON>, co-leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Guadeloupean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` A new status is being imposed on us, and nobody has asked our opinion.'' <LOCATION> Guadeloupe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Martinique </LOCATION>, about 150 miles apart halfway down the arc of the Lesser Antilles, are French overseas departments. They are as much a part of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> as <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> is of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Bakeries, Parisian accents, compact Citroen cars, cyclists wearing flashy racing tights training on picturesque rural roads all resemble <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. Many `` metropolitans,'' as the European French are called, own small shops and restaurants on the two islands. European drifters peddle jewelry on street corners or sing and play guitars at sidewalk cafes. With 500,000 resettled <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Indians </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> itself is influenced by <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> culture. Every islander has relatives or friends in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, and their music, `` zouk,'' similar to calypso, has millions of fans. Being French, the islands are part of the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>. Air travelers arriving here line up under customs signs that read in French `` non-EEC citizens'' and `` EEC citizens.'' The latter need no passports. A single European market with no travel, employment or residency restrictions would open the floodgates to immigration, opponents say. `` There are 23 million unemployed in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>; it only takes half a million to immigrate here and we're finished,'' said <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Makouke </PERSON>, leader of the small separatist <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> for the Liberation of <LOCATION> Guadeloupe </LOCATION>. `` The danger for <LOCATION> Guadeloupe </LOCATION> of remaining French is our cultural disappearance through intermixing with Europeans,'' <PERSON> Makouke </PERSON> said. `` For us, 1992 is the ` coup de grace.''' Most of the 680,000 residents of <LOCATION> Martinique </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Guadeloupe </LOCATION> are of African descent, with a sprinkling of East Indians and Europeans. Not everybody is opposed to a single European market. The regional assemblies of both islands favor the idea. `` Every Martiniquan should plant a banana tree for <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, because the market is there,'' said <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Petit </PERSON>, leader of the island's rightists and mayor of the mountain town of <LOCATION> Morne </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rouge </LOCATION>. `` <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> is what we need to lift us out of our torpor.'' French West Indians enjoy a high standard of living, receiving free health care and generous unemployment benefits. But 25 percent of the work force is unemployed and 30 percent have government jobs. The French state is the main source of income, followed by banana exports and tourism. `` People think that in 1992 we're going to see fleets of 747s flying in here packed with wealthy West Germans coming to buy up all the business,'' said <PERSON> Pierre-Luc </PERSON> <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yves </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Martiniquais </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> manager. `` We're already part of the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION>. The Germans could have come long ago.'' Yet, many islanders are alarmed at the quantity of farm land bought by European investors to build villas and hotels. They also fear the abolition in 1992 of a special tax on goods imported from <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. Towns here draw 50 percent of their revenues from the tax. Even <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> advocates like <PERSON> Petit </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yves </ORGANIZATION> argue that measures must be taken to preserve the tax and protect real estate from <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> speculators. Support for integration with <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> dates to the French Revolution of 1789. Newly freed slaves saw alliance with the revolutionary government in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> as a weapon against the local elite. Residents of <LOCATION> Martinique </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Guadeloupe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Guiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s other overseas department, on the northern shoulder of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, vote in <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> elections and elect deputies and senators to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> Since <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>, a Socialist, was elected president of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> in 1981 and turned over powers to local assemblies, the <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> islands have been run by their regional councils. They control their own budgets, development projects, cultural programs and tourism. Decentralization undercut support for independence, still unpopular despite anxiety over the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> of 1992. `` Our demand to have our cultural identity recognized has often been misinterpreted as a desire for independence,'' said <PERSON> Camille </PERSON> <PERSON> Darsiere </PERSON>, president of <LOCATION> Martinique </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Regional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>. While independence is a non-issue in <LOCATION> Martinique </LOCATION>, a small but vocal separatist movement simmers in <LOCATION> Guadeloupe </LOCATION>, where a rash of bombings in the early 1980s killed eight people and ended with the 1984 arrest of separatist militant <PERSON> Luc </PERSON> <PERSON> Reinette </PERSON>. `` Independence is losing ground. The word is used just to be heard,'' said <PERSON> Lucette </PERSON> <PERSON> Michaux-Chevry </PERSON>, deputy in the <ORGANIZATION> French </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> and leader of <LOCATION> Guadeloupe </LOCATION>'s rightists. `` We are a success story. Whether you like it or not, the French experiment worked here.''

 Once a week <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Alaskey </PERSON> is <PERSON> Beano </PERSON> on `` Out of This World,'' but the rest of the time he's virtually everyone else on television. He plays <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> Pescow </PERSON>'s annoying brother, <PERSON> Beano </PERSON> <PERSON> Froelich </PERSON>, in the syndicated sitcom. He also appears daily on the syndicated game show `` Couch Potatoes,'' and you never know who he's going to be. The versatile actor-writer-impressionist does voices of characters from Dr. <PERSON> Zorba </PERSON> on `` <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Casey </PERSON>'' to <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Perkins </PERSON> of `` Wild Kingdom'' to <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamner </PERSON>, the creator-narrator of `` The <ORGANIZATION> Waltons </ORGANIZATION>.'' Frequently, he's in costume and makeup on `` Couch Potatoes,'' or he may simply appear as himself, `` The Neighbor.'' He was the voice of <PERSON> Yosemite </PERSON> <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> in `` Who Framed Roger Rabbit'' and is on the CBS cartoon show `` The New Adventures of Mighty Mouse.'' His personal favorite is <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON> <PERSON> Gleason </PERSON>. <PERSON> Alaskey </PERSON> hopes to appear as `` The Great One'' in a film biography. `` I've been impersonating <PERSON> Gleason </PERSON> for years,'' he said. `` I even look a lot like him. I only worked with him once. When the ` lost episodes' of ` The Honeymooners' were found <ORGANIZATION> Viacom </ORGANIZATION> hired me to loop his voice on some of the bad sound tracks. I had to do it as <PERSON> Gleason </PERSON> sounded in the 1950s. `` <PERSON> Gleason </PERSON> picked me from listening to me on tape,'' <PERSON> Alaskey </PERSON> said, `` I also appeared as <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Kramden </PERSON> in a ` Honeymooners' sketch on a <PERSON> Suzanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Somers </PERSON> special.'' As <PERSON> Beano </PERSON> <PERSON> Froelich </PERSON> on `` Out of This World,'' <PERSON> Alaskey </PERSON> is often the butt of the jokes. `` I'm in on the secret that her daughter, <PERSON> Evie </PERSON>, has special powers because her father is a space alien,'' he said. `` I'm the only other member of the cast who knows, so I'm in all the ploys to keep it a secret. `` I'm generally the brunt of <PERSON> Evie </PERSON>'s magic. She'll turn me into a sheep dog or a 10-year-old kid. Or I may just stay his grouchy, spoiled self.'' <PERSON> Maureen </PERSON> <PERSON> Flannigan </PERSON> stars as <PERSON> Evie </PERSON> and <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> McClure </PERSON> plays the mayor. <PERSON> Alaskey </PERSON> has lost 80 pounds since starting `` Out of This World'' in September 1987. The 6-foot-1 actor now weighs 255 pounds. `` I'm still losing,'' he said `` I'll be able to play big guys instead of big fat guys. I'll be more presentable as an actor and stand up comic.'' The situation comedy was the first show <PERSON> Alaskey </PERSON> auditioned for when he moved here from <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. He had been a comedian-impressionist on a morning show on radio station <ORGANIZATION> WVBF </ORGANIZATION> and worked in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> as a standup comic. `` I got to <LOCATION> L.A. </LOCATION> when <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> was on a tour for the 25th anniversary of ` Rocky and Bullwinkle,''' he said. `` He came to <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> and we did some sketches on the radio show. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON>'s the voice of Bullwinkle. I did <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> Badenov </PERSON> and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON>, the announcer. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> said I did the best version of the voices he had heard. `` He said if I came to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> he'd help me find work. He was true to his word. He not only found me work but even moved me into my apartment. Then before I knew it I was on <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Letterman </PERSON>'s show That got me all kinds of offers from agents. Then I was an actor again.'' He recently starred in the movie `` Lucky Stiff'' and was the voice of Dr. <PERSON> Ziplock </PERSON> in another movie, `` Martians!'' <PERSON> Alaskey </PERSON> is writing two one-man shows, one an exploration of human needs called `` Q & amp; A,'' and one called `` An Evening with <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Alaskey </PERSON>.'' He's also writing and drawing a cartoon book of palindromes, which are words that are spelled the same forward and backward. Examples: `` Madam, I'm Adam'' and `` Sir, I'm <PERSON> Iris </PERSON>.''

 It's not unusual for an actor to appear regularly on two television shows, but <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Peck </PERSON> had pivotal roles on two competing prime-time soap operas, <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>' `` <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>'' and <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Dynasty.'' On `` <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>,'' he plays <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s bad-boy son, <PERSON> Tommy </PERSON> <PERSON> McKay </PERSON>, and on the just-canceled `` Dynasty'' he was <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Grimes </PERSON>, the mysterious dream-lover of <PERSON> Emma </PERSON> <PERSON> Samms </PERSON> and a nightmare from <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>' past. <PERSON> Peck </PERSON> has been notified by <ORGANIZATION> Lorimar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Productions </ORGANIZATION> that he'll be back next season on `` <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>.'' <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> is dropping `` Dynasty'' after nine seasons. <PERSON> Peck </PERSON> auditioned for `` Dynasty'' last year, but because of the writers strike he went to <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruces </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.M. </LOCATION>, to work in a movie called `` The Bite.'' He calls it a cross between `` Alien'' and `` The Fly.'' `` I'd written off ` Dynasty,' but when I got back they called me in,'' said <PERSON> Peck </PERSON>. `` They still had n't written the role, but he was to be <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>' ex-lover who was murdered 25 years ago. I played him as he was 25 years ago. I would come to <PERSON> Emma </PERSON> <PERSON> Samms </PERSON> in her dreams as her lover. `` Then I had a chance to audition for ` <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>.' I only had a week-to-week contract with ` Dynasty' and they would n't tell me what was going to happen. After I got hired by ` <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>' I was called back to ` Dynasty.' The people at ` <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>' did n't want to let me go and I did eight shows. It was on my resume that I was on ` Dynasty' but they apparently missed it The two shows do n't want to share actors.'' <PERSON> Peck </PERSON> was supposed to do only four shows for `` Dynasty,'' but ended up doing seven. <PERSON> Peck </PERSON> said he particularly likes his character on `` <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>'' because of his many facets. `` He's a wild, wild man,'' he said. `` He has a lot of pain, a lot of anguish. He has a bitter relationship with his father. You see a sympathetic level beneath the dark side. I really took the character out on a limb. There's a rage and frustration they did n't originally intend But once I tried it they liked it and started writing it that way.'' In the beginning, <PERSON> Peck </PERSON> did n't want to be an actor, but says eventually, `` I fell in love with it.'' His first roles were in the daytime soaps `` The Young and the Restless'' and `` Days of Our Lives.'' Later he had a recurring role in an <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> show, `` Double Trouble.'' Four years ago he was cast in an <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> Western series called `` Wildside.'' It ran for only six episodes in 1985, up against <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` The Cosby Show'' and <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>' `` Magnum P.I.'' `` It was a <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> show and <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> treated us first class,'' he said. `` They spoiled us. I did n't know everybody else does n't get this kind of treatment. It was a turning point in a lot of ways.'' <PERSON> Peck </PERSON>, who was born in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and grew up in <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, is married to <PERSON> Sonya </PERSON> <PERSON> Zaza </PERSON> <PERSON> Peck </PERSON>, a high-fashion runway model.

 Actor <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Waterston </PERSON> listened to the tapes to prepare for his role as <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> in a TV movie. A <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> woman heard the voices of her great-grandmothers on the tapes regarded as a priceless scholarly record of the voices of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. The accents of Americans, famous and ordinary, from <PERSON> Groucho </PERSON> <PERSON> Marx </PERSON> and <PERSON> Eleanor </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON> to <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> sharecroppers, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Puerto Rican teen-agers, Serbian ironworkers from <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chesapeake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> watermen and Gullahs from coastal <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, are preserved on 250 hours of tapes in the archives of the Library of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Among the treasures are the rarely heard voice of vanished aviator <PERSON> Amelia </PERSON> <PERSON> Earhart </PERSON>; the story of an 1869 whaling voyage told by a <LOCATION> Nantucket </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, seafarer; an elderly <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> lady reciting her watermelon rind recipe; and the first American recording by <PERSON> Alistair </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooke </PERSON>, a caustic young British drama student in 1934 who describes his loathing of <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>. The dialect recordings are housed in the library's American Folklife Center. The center's Archive of Folk Culture contains more than 35,000 hours of audio cylinders, discs, wires and tapes and more than 100,000 pages of manuscripts of songs, instrumental music, folk tales, oral histories and other forms of American cultural expression. The first major collection was donated to the folklife center in 1984 by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dialect </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, a professional organization of linguistic scholars. It consists of 1,300 aluminum, 78-rpm discs of regional <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> speech _ 132 hours in all _ that were recorded in the early 1930s by field workers for a projected linguistic atlas of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. The library is nearing completion of the time-consuming task of transferring those recordings from discs to standard 10-inch, double-track Mylar tapes for permanent storage. Then, in 1986, the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Applied </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Linguistics </ORGANIZATION>, a non-profit <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> education and research organization, donated an 118-hour sampler of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> dialects drawn from previously inaccessible private collections. Those tapes were compiled from scattered private holdings by the center's project director, <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> Christian </PERSON>, with the help of a $ 79,000 grant from the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Endowment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Humanities </ORGANIZATION>. The Library of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> called her tape collection, which took more than two years to assemble, `` an aural kaleidoscope of the American experience.'' <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Parsons </PERSON>, reference librarian at the American Folklife Center, said the tapes are `` a gold mine for genealogical purposes'' because the 1930s recordings frequently included ordinary people talking informally about their home territory, complete with family names, birth dates and burial sites. One woman visitor from <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> appeared at the center recently to inquire about elderly relatives, now dead, who were supposed to have been interviewed and recorded by famed folklorist <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lomax </PERSON> about 50 years ago. `` Within five or 10 minutes, she was sitting here with earphones, listening to the voices of her two great-grandmothers,'' <PERSON> Parsons </PERSON> said. As part of his research for the role of <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> in the <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> mini-series, `` <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Vidal </PERSON>'s Lincoln'' in March 1988, <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Waterston </PERSON> spent two days at the folklife center listening to 1940s recordings of natives of the <LOCATION> Smoky </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION>. No one knows exactly what <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> sounded like, <PERSON> Parsons </PERSON> said, so <PERSON> Waterston </PERSON> sought clues from the speech patterns of people from eastern <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> was reared in <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> in the 1820s by immigrant parents, but his speech probably was influenced more strongly in those formative years by his western <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> mother than his father's <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> forebears. `` <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> listened to the Smoky Mountain samples, knowing full well they were not carbon copies of what <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> spoke, but our best guess was that they were as close as you can come today to his mother's speech,'' <PERSON> Parsons </PERSON> said. Ms. <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> and <PERSON> Walt </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolfram </PERSON>, her research associate at the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Applied </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Linguistics </ORGANIZATION>, said in an interview that <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s regional dialects remain strong and distinctive today They agreed that the homogenizing influence of television and easy mobility have diluted some of the peculiarities of speech in isolated regions such as <LOCATION> Appalachia </LOCATION>, where expressions like `` I'm a-going'' and `` hit's a nice day'' are heard less often But the Southern dialect, once deliberately softened to make it more socially acceptable, is enjoying a resurgence in the cosmopolitan `` New South'' where being a Dixie native is a source of newfound pride, they noted. Likewise, they said, natives of <PERSON> Martha </PERSON>'s Vineyard and other <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> vacation spots are emphasizing their distinctive speech to retain their identity amid hordes of summertime visitors. Do n't let all those look-alike strips along the interstate highways fool you, <PERSON> Wolfram </PERSON> said. `` There's a certain deceptiveness to what looks alike,'' he said. `` The guy behind the counter at <ORGANIZATION> McDonald </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> will say, ` Have a good day,' and the guy in <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> will still say ` Have a good-un'.''

<HEAD>Florida Abortion-Consent Law Collides With Growing Problem</HEAD>

 The 15-year-old girl was defiant. `` Just because you tell me I ca n't have an abortion does n't mean I'm going to go home and tell my mom,'' she told the judge. `` I'm going to another court. The teen-ager was preparing an appeal with a legal services lawyer but was spared the fight when an appeals court overturned the state's abortion-consent law in a case involving another central <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> girl, identified only as T.W. After hopscotching up to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> and back, T.W.'s case is now before <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s highest court for a June 27 hearing on whether the state can constitutionally require unmarried minors to get parental or judicial consent for an abortion. T.W. is believed to have received an abortion after the law was put on hold, but neither she nor her lawyer, <PERSON> Jerri </PERSON> <PERSON> Blair </PERSON>, would discuss her condition. The new <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> law has focused attention on teen-age pregnancy and on the difficulties in adding legal restrictions for minors' abortions <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> <PERSON> Arick </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Birth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION>, used the case of the defiant 15-year-old girl to illustrate those difficulties. That girl and a 16-year-old who got an abortion the same day had been denied under-age `` waivers'' by judges, Ms. <PERSON> Arick </PERSON> said. `` We had told them that with all the ups and downs in the courtrooms to just hang in there,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Arick </PERSON>, who described the younger girl as `` very persistent,'' an only daughter whose parents had considered her a perfect child who could do no wrong. `` She felt that if they found out about her pregnancy, they would not trust her ever again and limit her activities the rest of the time she was in that house,'' Ms. <PERSON> Arick </PERSON> said. Dr. <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Moffett </PERSON>, who delivered babies in nearby <LOCATION> Leesburg </LOCATION> for 16 years until quitting obstetrics earlier this year, said teen-age pregnancy is `` a major problem, both here in <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> and in many areas of the state. ... Everyone who practices obstetrics sees 12 -, 13 - and 14-year-olds having babies <PERSON> Moffett </PERSON> said 25 percent to 30 percent of the indigent patients he treated at <ORGANIZATION> Leesburg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> were minor, unmarried girls. That is in line with estimates from abortion-rights activists, who say minors received about a third of the 75,000 abortions performed in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> last year. `` Teen-age pregnancies are on the rise,'' <PERSON> Moffett </PERSON> said. `` We do n't need all kinds of statistics to know that. We need to teach these young ladies what to do. That's why sex education in the schools is so terribly important.'' The primary reason for young pregnancies, <PERSON> Moffett </PERSON> believes, is a lack of guidance at home, church and school. `` They do n't know how or what to do and how to keep from getting pregnant,'' he said. `` The moral implications are up to the family and the church. But someone needs to teach them the mechanics.'' In a report released May 24, the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Project </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Infant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mortality </ORGANIZATION> said the South has a higher rate of teen-age pregnancy than the rest of the nation and called for an intensified education campaign aimed at boys as well as young girls. `` When our children have children, we all lose,'' said <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Mabus </PERSON>, co-chairman of the group. The report said Southern girls under age 17 accounted for 47 percent of the nation's 178,000 teen-age births in 1985 although the region was home to just 37 percent of the girls in that age group. <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s consent law, which was enacted in February, required a girl under 18 who did not have her parents' consent for an abortion to go before a judge and convince him that her parents were unreasonable in withholding consent or that she feared physical or emotional abuse if she requested help from parents or a guardian. Before that, a girl legally did not need anyone's permission, although many hospitals, clinics and doctors required some type of parental authorization. The consent law might have little effect from a practical standpoint, said Dr. <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Barr </PERSON>, a gynecologist who is director of the <ORGANIZATION> EPOC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clinic </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Maitland </LOCATION>. `` Contrary to the right-to-life propaganda, most minors come with their parents,'' <PERSON> Barr </PERSON> said. `` And the parents are as anxious, if not more anxious, than their 12 - or 13 - or 15-year-old daughter'' for an A 15-year-old who identified herself only as <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> had an abortion at the <ORGANIZATION> Birth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION> recently with her mother's consent. `` It would n't have been as easy for some of my friends as it was for me,'' because their parents would not have been as supportive, she said. However, if her mother had not agreed, <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> said, `` I do n't think it would have been worth going to the court or whatever I had to do Besides, it would have been like going behind my mother's back. At the BETA Center in <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION>, another 15-year-old, <PERSON> Cathy </PERSON>, spoke fearfully about her problems. Seven months pregnant, she is saddened at having been `` disowned'' by her father although her mother would have agreed to an abortion. She says she and her boyfriend will put the baby up for adoption. `` I never thought of an abortion. ... The law did n't matter to me,'' she said. But, she added, the pair never considered the consequences of having a baby. They `` never thought about finishing school or the money or anything,'' she said. `` That was just being selfish. We probably would be living off welfare or something,'' if they had decided to keep the child. That lack of knowledge and thought is why <PERSON> Moffett </PERSON> gives sex education lectures at schools, church fellowships and youth organizations. `` I just spoke to about 90 fifth-grade girls at <LOCATION> Fruitland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> about contraception, and the questions from the 10 -, 11 - and 12-year-old kids would just blow your socks off,'' he `` They ask about condoms and intercourse and the pill. ... These children are getting the information, but they're getting it off the playground.'' <PERSON> Moffett </PERSON> said he feared the consequences of restrictive abortion laws. `` What we're seeing are efforts to legislate away abortions,'' he said. `` They may be made legal or illegal, but they wo n't go away. They may have to go underground again, and that's a bigger tragedy. Then we will lose mothers as well as fetuses.''

<TEXT>
 Four years ago, the <ORGANIZATION> Hartford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION> was struggling with a huge deficit and a drastic decline in ticket subscriptions. Today, thanks to some brilliant management and artistic performances, the theater has not only rebounded with budget surpluses and sold-out shows, but will receive a coveted Tony Award as the outstanding regional theater in the country, when the theater honors its own on June 4. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Lamos </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Stage </LOCATION>'s 43-year-old artistic director now in his ninth year at the theater, says the award recognizes a quarter-century of theatrical achievement. But he admits that four years ago, no matter how laudable the productions, the critics' accolades probably would have gone unheard `` I think when the theater began, the first two regimes of artists and managers were not at all concerned about getting the word out,'' <PERSON> Lamos </PERSON> said. `` There was a sense that we disdain any sort of national opportunity, any sort of national recognition. `` That began to seem a little bit unrealistic to me. I thought, ` Here we have this beautiful new theater, we're doing work on a big scale, we're ... in a highly competitive, charged atmosphere of theater excellence. Well, let's be a part of that.''' <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION> Stage captured critics' attention with its modern adaptations of classical works. Its current triumph is a monumental, two-part, five-hour production of `` Peer Gynt,'' which played to sold-out crowds from all over the country before closing a week ago. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuchwara </PERSON>, drama critic for the <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, called it `` a glorious theatrical adventure, a journey that <PERSON> Lamos </PERSON> manages to make both epic and intimate.'' Last year, <PERSON> Lamos </PERSON> staged a modern-dress production of `` Hamlet'' set in a banana republic in turmoil. <PERSON> Lamos </PERSON>, whose six-play repertoire each season includes at least half new plays, admits he prefers classics for their ability `` to be inflamed again by living actors _ and with passion _ and speak right to us.'' `` The large plays from a century or two or longer ago have such a tremendous scope I feel they exist for us now so that we can get in touch with something that we lost, both spiritually and as a society,'' he said. `` Whether it's a play by <PERSON> Aeschylus </PERSON> about the murder of Agamemnon, or whether it's a Shakespearean comedy about the possibility of forgiveness in an imperfect world, no matter what it is, it's going to be something that widens you're ideas about the world. `` It -LRB- theater -RRB- is a place for real spectacle, real wonder, mystery, ambiguity _ all the reasons you go to church, all the reasons the Greeks initially went to the theater _ to be sort of blown away by the mystery of it.'' But <PERSON> Lamos </PERSON>, looking youthful in blue jeans and high-top sneakers, says those lofty thoughts have little to do with Hartford Stage's rise to national prominence Instead, he credits <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawkanson </PERSON>, his managerial counterpart in a business suit and glasses. <PERSON> Hawkanson </PERSON> was lured from the <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Theatre </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION>. He inherited an accumulated deficit of $ 440,000 and 7,900 subscribers _ down from 17,000 in 1977, when he arrived in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> in 1985. He hired marketing and public relations teams, began a telemarketing campaign and went after the national press. Each year since <PERSON> Hawkanson </PERSON>'s arrival, the company has posted operating surpluses, reducing the overall deficit to $ 110,000. Hawkanson expects it to be completely wiped out by next year. In 1989, the theater's 25th anniversary, subscriptions are back up to 15,000, and attendance this year is expected to total 120,000, or about 95 percent of capacity. `` We worked very hard to get national criticism,'' <PERSON> Hawkanson </PERSON> said. `` An actor will give up nine weeks to work here if they think it will not get lost. Our ability to attract those people is directly related to their perception about what is being done here.'' The decision of Emmy-award winning actor <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> -LRB- `` The Waltons'' -RRB- to return for a second production in <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION>, is proof of the strategy's success. Last year, he played the title role in `` Hamlet.'' This year, eager to tackle another difficult role and to work again with <PERSON> Lamos </PERSON>, he returned for `` Peer Gynt,'' and he looks forward to returning a third time. `` It's a great thing to find someone with whom one wants to work and get satisfaction,'' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said. `` An actor of my caliber should be pleased to work at a theater like <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION>. `` They do interesting new plays and revivals of older ones. Because it's in <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION> and one does n't earn a lot of money, people seem to think it's a sacrifice to work here. It is n't at all.'' The special <PERSON> Tony </PERSON>, based on recommendations by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Theater </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Critics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, is presented by the League of American Theater Producers and the American Theater Wing. <PERSON> Lamos </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hawkanson </PERSON> will accept it during televised <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> ceremonies on June 4, making <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION> the second <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> theater to receive a Tony for outstanding regional theater in the award's 14-year history. Long Wharf Theatre in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Haven </LOCATION> received the award in 1978.

<TEXT>
 Lacking an assistant secretary for inter-American affairs, Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> had to put in 40 hours negotiating with leaders of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid to the Nicaraguan Contras. Lacking presidential appointees to 33 key jobs in the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> had to tell <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> it could n't meet deadlines for decisions on mobile missiles, a scaled-down Star Wars, the cost of the new B-2 stealth bomber or the impact of a prospective arms treaty. Lacking experts to run the huge <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> nuclear weapons plant in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, Energy Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> fears that the nation will run out of tritium, a key component for nuclear warheads, and frets `` this is unilateral disarmament we're talking about.'' One twelfth of the way into <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s four-year term of office, the government still lacks key players in key places. By the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>'s count, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> appointees are confirmed and on the job in only 25 percent of the 447 key policy-making posts requiring <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> confirmation. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Untermeyer </PERSON>, the White House personnel chief, acknowledges, `` It is certainly taking longer than we would like.'' But <PERSON> Untermeyer </PERSON> waves away the concerns expressed all over <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s slowness in fielding his own team is keeping alive an image of a presidency that lacks mission, purpose and vision. He offers an array of defenses and explanations: _ It is a `` friendly takeover,'' so no harm is done if some <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> holdovers remain aboard for a few more months `` We look upon them as people who are carrying on the policy that <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> embraced,'' he says. _ Better slow than sorry <PERSON> Untermeyer </PERSON> says he'd rather explain now why a job is still vacant than explain months for now that a bad apple was shoved in `` because we were being pressured to name someone.'' _ It takes longer to find qualified women and minorities The administration is pleased that so far 20 percent of presidential appointments have gone to people in those categories. To date, according to <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> <PERSON> Starek </PERSON>, deputy to <PERSON> Untermeyer </PERSON>, important jobs have gone to 36 women, 13 blacks, seven Hispanics and three people of <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> heritage. _ Some of the still unfilled jobs have unusual technical requirements, such as the assistant secretary of commerce who serves as commissioiner of patents and trademarks <PERSON> Untermeyer </PERSON> wonders aloud why such posts are political appointments in the first place. _ Background checks by the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> are vital, but slow down the process <PERSON> Untermeyer </PERSON> says they take take one to two months; the bureau disagrees, saying it does the job in 22 days on average. _ The first months of a new administration are spent in making policy and the rest of the time in carrying it out For policymaking, the key players _ chiefly the <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> _ are in place. So, says <PERSON> Untermeyer </PERSON>: `` The lack of an assistant secretary here or there has not kept <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> from getting a budget compromise, settling the FSX -LRB- the joint U.S.-Japan jet fighter -RRB-, working out the S & amp; L bailout or developing proposals on child care, education and gun control. These are the hallmarks of an administration that is up and running.'' Others dispute that view as rosy. At an agency where only four of 20 key positions have been filled, an official, who spoke on condition he would not be identified, said: `` My sense is that the secretary has got to be frustrated. He has half a dozen major things on his plate and for the moment has only a few people to deal with them.'' Other facts complicate the situation. During a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> hearing, Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Warner </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Va </LOCATION>., had an aide read off some data <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> had assembled: 18 to 24 people had turned down the job of undersecretary of defense for acquisition Most cited the pay level or a new ethics law with a stiff revolving door provision that keeps people who leave government from taking a job in an industry they dealt with while in government. But <PERSON> Untermeyer </PERSON> says <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is moving as fast as predecessors. He says: `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has nominated 156 people vs. 184 at this time for <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. He has announced his intention to nominate another 45 and has retained 13 <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> appointees for a total of 214. So he's practically at the same level as President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was eight years ago. The notion that we are ` slow' is with no fixed point of reference.'' For all that, those in charge of running pieces of the government are not so patient. In almost every executive agency, key decisions are postponed because those who will make them _ or live with them _ are not in place. Key jobs are occupied by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> holdovers who are unsure whether they're going to be retained and unlikely to sign off on any new initiatives. At the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, slowness in filling key posts `` is delaying getting the admiral's agenda off the ground,'' said <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Easton </PERSON>, executive assistant to <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON>, the retired naval officer named by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to run the department. `` If you do n't have your team together, how can you play the game?'' At the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>, the long battle over the nomination of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> to be defense secretary stalled action on issues requiring political or policy judgments. Some people who were hired and started working when it appeared Tower would be in charge have been told they're out of work under <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> has n't had an administrator since <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> McArtor </PERSON> left on Feb. 17. Critical issues are piling up _ the need to deal with aging airliners, international terrorism, a crunch in airport capacity and a continuing shortage of air traffic controllers. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has chosen an admiral, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Busey </PERSON> <PERSON> IV </PERSON>, to take over the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION>, but that will require a law exempting him from a requirement that the job go to a civilian.

 Along <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> waterways starting to resemble an aquatic Interstate 95, a new kind of traffic is worrying the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION> _ water scooters, sometimes piloted by children hardly old enough to ride a bicycle. The model names ring with excitement: <ORGANIZATION> Kawasaki </ORGANIZATION> makes Jet Skis, <ORGANIZATION> Yamaha </ORGANIZATION> sells Wave Runners and <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> offers the Surf Jet, for example. But the boats that resemble snowmobiles are increasingly a factor in some of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s worst accidents, and complaints about operators are growing. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION> seems to come in contact with an awful lot of people who are not safe and responsible, who are not reasonable and prudent,'' said patrol Capt. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Lamphear </PERSON>. `` They have lost touch with reality.'' A 9-year-old boy died in March after his scooter, dead in the water, was hit by another of the 7-foot-long craft in <LOCATION> Biscayne </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> off <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. A 5-year-old boy survived after his head and chest were slashed open by a boat that ran over his scooter in a lake north of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, also in March. <PERSON> J.B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Spence </PERSON>, attorney for the family of the 9-year-old victim, accuses operators of terrorizing swimmers and other boaters and has a personal lawsuit pending against riders who frequent a canal by his house in the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Keys </LOCATION>. `` You see what they're like. They're like bucking broncos, they ride the wake, they race,'' said <PERSON> Spence </PERSON>, who likens the machines' sound to the roar of a chainsaw `` They're just absolutely so rude and arrogant that I sued them. I'm going to take them into court and try to teach them some manners.'' The two <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> accidents have focused attention on the first statewide effort to regulate the low-riding vessels that are propelled by a concentrated jet of water. Riders sit or kneel on the machines, depending on the model. The six manufacturers of personal watercraft, which generally cost $ 2,500 to $ 4,500, support the legislation by state Sen. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> McPherson </PERSON>, and view it as a national model to regulate the skis and their free-wheeling operators. The measure was approved unanimously in late April by the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and was passed overwhelmingly by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> last Friday. Quick to realize they could be at risk from government regulators, the manufacturers _ the other three are <ORGANIZATION> Wet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Bombardier </ORGANIZATION> and Ultranautics _ support <PERSON> McPherson </PERSON>'s bill It sets an operator age limit of 14 for private vessels and 16 for rentals, banning reckless operation, restricting operation to daylight hours, requiring operators to wear floatation vests and a cut-off switch to stop the engine if the rider falls off. Violation, a second-degree misdemeanor, would carry a $ 35 fine or 60 days in jail. Weaving through congested traffic, jumping wakes and `` playing chicken'' would be outlawed, said Maj. <PERSON> Denis </PERSON> <PERSON> Grealish </PERSON>, boating safety coordinator for the marine patrol. `` None of our investigations have revealed any inherent safety problem or defects with the craft. `` All of our problems have been caused by operator error. When you look at these types of craft and the type of quick, fast movement they're capable of and the centrifugal forces operating against these people as they're making turns, you have to have a certain amount of strength, coordination, balance and judgment to operate these things.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Personal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Watercraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, representing the six manufacturers, also is monitoring other efforts to regulate the craft, such as an assortment of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> bills that would ban the vessels on small lakes where residents have registered noise complaints. The organization estimates that 150,000 Americans own the scooters. Most regulations are imposed locally for specific water bodies, but the industry hopes to take the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> bill to <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> next in its bid to spread the measure nationally, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dane </PERSON>, government relations representative in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. `` We're hoping this bill serves as a national model,'' <PERSON> Dane </PERSON> said. The problem in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> is compounded by burgeoning enthusiasm for boating. Roughly 680,000 vessels, including 10,000 personal watercraft, are registered to operate along <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s 1,350 miles of coastline and 11,000 miles of rivers, creeks and streams. <PERSON> Grealish </PERSON> estimates another 200,000 to 300,000 boats operate in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> on a transient basis. The state leads the nation in boating fatalities with 106 in 1987 and 94 in 1988. Six involved personal watercraft last year. Of the state's 11 fatalities with personal watercraft, only two involved minors. Most victims are men ranging from their late teens to mid 30s. <PERSON> McPherson </PERSON> has used the 1987 ban on manufacture of three-wheel all-terrain vehicles, blamed for nearly 1,000 deaths and 300,000 injuries in five years, as a club in his bid to regulate personal watercraft. Manufacturers `` first were kind of resistant to any legislation,'' he said. But he noted in conversations with industry representatives that `` three-wheelers went by the wayside because they did n't have regulations, and the same thing could happen to Jet Skis.''

<TEXT>
 In the arcane world of <LOCATION> East-West </LOCATION> arms negotiations, a public relations touch can be a powerful tool. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will be trying to apply his own at the 40th anniversary <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> summit, opening in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> on Monday. He has some catching up to do. Built into administration complaints about public relations ploys in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> arms proposals is a tacit admission that <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has been using that American technique to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s disadvantage <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s national security adviser, <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON>, acknowledged the importance of appearance when the administration offered an upbeat appraisal of new Soviet proposals on conventional arms limits. `` The president felt he appeared too negative before, so he's trying to appear more positive now,'' Scowcroft said. This is the president's week to try to counter <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, to cast himself and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as the real peacemakers. He's conferring with allied leaders in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> But reclaiming the initiative will take more imaginative gestures than his revived `` open skies'' arms verification proposal or the `` open ledgers'' idea he offered on Wednesday. With <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> piling theoretical troops, tanks and missiles onto the negotiating table, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is left trying to explain a valid concern: that even if those proposals come true, the Soviet side will still have a hefty margin in weapons and troops. That is what the administration says must be balanced by <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s battlefield nuclear weapons. The White House insists that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is the one doing the responding, that his arms reduction offers are in answers to proposals first made by the West. The president's men are trying to cast <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as the visionary leader, the man whose themes and concepts will endure to reshape the world balance long after the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s itemized proposals have been forgotten. Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> said western values and principles are behind the changes occurring in the Communist world. `` We're winning economically, we're winning politically, we have the other philosophy acknowledging that it is a failure,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. `` So, whatever we're doing is working ... and for the time being I do n't think we ought to ... say that we're going to change that just for PR purposes.'' But the <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> proposals are scoring public opinion points in western <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, details and long-term merit notwithstanding. Even as <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> called <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s latest offer `` forthcoming'' and said it held promise for conventional force reductions, he said it does not alter the need for Western deterrence, which means nuclear weapons in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. `` These reductions alone, even if implemented, are not enough to eliminate the significant numerical superiority that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> enjoys right now,'' the president said Wednesday. Nevertheless, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has a problem not unlike the one he created for <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> during the 1988 presidential campaign. In those days, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was the one making catchy proposals and accusations, leaving <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> to struggle through the fine print as he tried to explain them away. Now, in a different kind of campaign, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has managed to do most of the sound-biting. After <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s offer to cut conventional arms, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> came back with an accountant's challenge: `` I call on the Soviets to do as we have always done. Let's open the ledgers, publish an accurate defense budget.'' `` Open budgets openly arrived at'' is not a slogan likely to stir the Western alliance. <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> knew the public relations side of the arms control balance, and played to it. A conservative candidate who had opposed arms limitation deals before he came to office, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> boosted the defense budget and took a hard line in early talks. And at the same time, he said that he was n't satisfied with strategic arms limitation efforts, that he wanted a strategic arms reduction treaty. No more SALT talks. START talks. Later, the zero option, applied by treaty to intermediate range nuclear missiles. That precedent is a problem now, with the West Germans pressing for immediate negotiations on short-range nuclear weapons and the administration wary of pressure to eliminate them, too. Now <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has the edge in <LOCATION> Moscow-Washington </LOCATION> public relations contest. His proposals position the administration as the naysayer. His offers come with such visual aids as flowers in Red Square on May Day instead of glowering commissars reviewing missiles on parade. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> warns that such soothing signs must be read with prudence. `` The West is being tested by complacency,'' he said. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> needs to be seen as creative and forward-looking in dealing with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and the changing <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. But <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said that does n't mean `` going into an arms control grab bag and competing with him on that score.''

 <ORGANIZATION> Avon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. Chairman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Preston </PERSON> says his 13-year-old stepdaughter has come home from school in tears because of classmate taunts about cosmetics companies killing animals in lab tests He probably has felt similar emotions lately. Not only is Avon a target of animal rights protests, the company also is under intense pressure to improve its financial performance. The pressure has been building since <PERSON> Avon </PERSON> rejected a $ 2.1 billion takeover proposal from <ORGANIZATION> Amway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a decision <PERSON> Preston </PERSON> may live to regret if <PERSON> Avon </PERSON> fails to achieve what some securities analysts are describing as highly optimistic sales and profit projections. The beauty products giant, known in past years for the slogan `` <PERSON> Ding </PERSON> <PERSON> Dong </PERSON>, Avon Calling'' because of its white-gloved women door-to-door sales squads, was putting the finishing touches on a radical make over when <ORGANIZATION> Amway </ORGANIZATION>'s offer landed on its own doorstep earlier this month. In response to the unwanted overture, the management team led by <PERSON> Preston </PERSON> huddled to plot a revised strategy aimed at justifying their determination to preserve <PERSON> Avon </PERSON>'s independence. <PERSON> Preston </PERSON>, during an interview in his office overlooking <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Central Park, summed up the goal this way: `` To run this business differently than it's ever been run before.'' Put like that, the task sounds simple. Judging by the critical questions <PERSON> Preston </PERSON> fielded during a session to explain details of the plan to financial analysts, however, <PERSON> Avon </PERSON> has a lot to prove. To be fair, <PERSON> Avon </PERSON>'s harshest recent critics may be motivated more by their own desire for quick profits than byan interest in enhancing <PERSON> Avon </PERSON>'s growth. Takeover stock speculators, for instance, lost money after buying Avon shares on the hunch <ORGANIZATION> Amway </ORGANIZATION>'s original $ 39-a-share offer might incite a bidding war. But even those who respect <PERSON> Preston </PERSON>'s management and experience in the direct-selling business think he may have trouble keeping his promises. `` It's really a very aggressive game plan in which all the pieces of the puzzle have to fit exactly,'' says <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Shore </PERSON>, analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` There's no room for error, everything has to go right. If he does n't hit these numbers clearly, there's going to be a credibility problem.'' Shore, who had been recommending purchase of Avon shares based on the theory that expectations for the company were overly pessimistic, says he is reassessing his rating. Among the new numbers that have evoked scepticism are 1989 earnings per share from continuing operations of $ 2.30 to $ 2.40, on a fully diluted basis. Avon management now is forecasting 1990 per-share earnings of at least $ 3.35 and at least $ 4 in 1991. The estimates far exceed management's expectations circulated privately around the time of the company's annual shareholders meeting on May 4. Avon normally does n't reveal projections. It departed from usual practice in an attempt to persuade shareholders that management made the right decision in rebuffing <ORGANIZATION> Amway </ORGANIZATION>, a privately held company based in <LOCATION> Ada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION> that sells products ranging from household cleaner to office supplies. Many observers say <PERSON> Avon </PERSON> has been on the right trackfor several years and they applaud <PERSON> Preston </PERSON>'s pursuit of a higher profile for <ORGANIZATION> Avon </ORGANIZATION>'s core beauty business. <PERSON> Avon </PERSON> has nearly completed the divestiture of its disappointing health care services holdings and <PERSON> Preston </PERSON> has admitted it was a mistake for <ORGANIZATION> Avon </ORGANIZATION> to have entered that business in the first place. The transformation has n't been altogether smooth. Despite 1988 sales of $ 3.06 billion, largely via 1.4 million independent sales representatives in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and more than 80 other countries, <PERSON> Avon </PERSON> lost $ 404.5 million in losses on discontinued operations. <PERSON> Lauren </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wong </PERSON>, analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Oppenheimer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, credits Prestonwith having the broad experience necessary for <ORGANIZATION> Avon </ORGANIZATION> to maintain its ranking as the biggest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> direct-selling company and a major supplier of beauty products <PERSON> Preston </PERSON>, 56, began his Avon career in 1964 as a management trainee. He's held positions in sales and marketing and international field operations. As head of the beauty group starting in 1981, he steered the division out of a slump and visited sales representatives to learn their complaints. His elevation to president and chief operating officer in May 1988 came as a surprise because another <ORGANIZATION> Avon </ORGANIZATION> executive, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Chamberlin </PERSON>, had been widely believed to be ahead of <PERSON> Preston </PERSON> for the position. <PERSON> Preston </PERSON> was named chief executive officer in September 1988 and became chairman of the board in January of this year after <PERSON> Hicks </PERSON> <PERSON> Waldron </PERSON> retired. One of the biggest questions about <PERSON> Avon </PERSON>'s revised strategy is why the company has backed off its earlier, higher predictions for overseas growth. Even after discounting the adverse impact of a stronger dollar, the overseas estimates still are slightly below previous expectations. Most analysts consider foreign markets to offer the best opportunities for direct sellers. <PERSON> Wong </PERSON> of Oppenheimer says it had been anticipated that sales outside the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would outpace domestic sales, but <PERSON> Avon </PERSON> apparently has scaled back expansion plans abroad. <PERSON> Wong </PERSON> says the strategy could backfire by sacrificing future growth in favor of short-term profits. Although <PERSON> Avon </PERSON> seems to have discouraged <ORGANIZATION> Amway </ORGANIZATION> for now, observers do n't think <PERSON> Avon </PERSON> automatically can count on unchallenged independence, especially if financial results do n't meet its projections. <ORGANIZATION> Amway </ORGANIZATION> still owns a chunk of <LOCATION> Avon </LOCATION> stock and could make another pitch some time to <PERSON> Avon </PERSON>'s board. Takeover investor <PERSON> Irwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> also owns some Avon shares. <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> <PERSON> Corp. </PERSON>, the Dallas-based cosmetics seller, has expressed an interest in <LOCATION> Avon </LOCATION> and speculation about other suitors has surfaced. <PERSON> Preston </PERSON> says numerous prospective buyers have approached him, with particular interest in <LOCATION> Avon </LOCATION>'s retail fragrance business, consisting of some of the country's most popular perfumes sold in department stores, such as <PERSON> Giorgio </PERSON>. So far, he says he's responded the same way to everybody: `` The answer is _ not for sale.'' While <PERSON> Preston </PERSON>'s fending off takeover feelers, he also is trying to deflect criticism from one animal welfare group, People for the <ORGANIZATION> Ethical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treatment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Animals </ORGANIZATION>, that doubts <PERSON> Avon </PERSON>'s commitment to discontinuing the use of animals to screen the safety of its products. The criticism is unfair, says <PERSON> Preston </PERSON>, because <PERSON> Avon </PERSON> has led the trend toward adopting non-animal test methods and has donated money to researching alternatives. Of the animal rights group that has been picking on <LOCATION> Avon </LOCATION>, even protesting near <LOCATION> Preston </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> home, <PERSON> Preston </PERSON> says: `` I want nothing to do with their confrontational style. They have set back the animal rights movement.''

<TEXT>
 Network crews are applauded by demonstrators in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, well aware of the power of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> television. The Chinese government, similarly aware of that power, shuts down live satellite transmissions to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in the heat of the demonstrations. Television brought the world the Civil Rights and anti-war movements of the 1960s, the mass demonstrations in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in the 1970s, the people's uprising in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> in the 1980s. As the Yippies in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> chanted 21 years ago, `` The whole world is watching!'' This time we might be at a turning point. The Chinese government pulled the plug on network transmissions, but that did n't stop it. `` You had this wonderful situation of American television feeding back information -LRB- to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> -RRB-, and Chinese Americans using everything from fax machines to telephones to feed information back to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Lichter </PERSON> of the Washington-based <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION>, which monitors the media. `` This really illustrates the truism that free information is the enemy of authoritariansim, because it undercuts the ability to control what people know. `` We are finally really attaining the ` global village' that <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> <PERSON> McLuhan </PERSON> had predicted. ... Now it really is possible for the whole world to be involved in social change anywhere in the globe as it happens _ and the only thing that can do is speed up the process.'' `` The powerful hold press conferences. The powerless hold demonstrations,'' said <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION> sociology professor <PERSON> Todd </PERSON> <PERSON> Gitlin </PERSON>, author of `` Inside Prime Time'' and `` The Sixties.'' `` The media coverage is n't the only motive for the demonstrations, but it does amplify what they do.'' In the case of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, the government miscalculated the effect of pulling the plug on <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> networks. That only increased the coverage _ by 50 percent, according to <PERSON> Lichter </PERSON>. On the other hand, said <PERSON> Lichter </PERSON>, the coverage is `` less important in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> than was in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, because the situation in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> is less dependent on <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> public opinion. <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> has less to fear from television than <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> did,'' since <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> counted on <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> support for his government. Nevertheless, American living rooms have been filled the last two weeks with wrenchingly sympathetic scenes of courageous Chinese students defying the government and going on hunger strikes in their quest for greater freedom. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rather </PERSON> called them `` these kids laying their lives on the line'' for democracy. <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON> recalled going through roadblocks in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. `` People smiled and waved us on through. And people were applauding us in <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>. It's clear that people know who we are, ` we' meaning journalists _ being broadcast, television, radio or print, photographers, still or videotape _ they know the importance and the value of having us cover the story.'' If the networks portray the Chinese students as the scrappy, freedom-loving underdogs and the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> government hard-liners as bad guys, they put themselves in the role of the cavalry. It seemed the biggest event on <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> TV </ORGANIZATION> last week was the Chinese government's act of unplugging network satellite transmissions. The networks seemed to revel in the unusual confrontation with blatant repression, especially CBS and <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION>, which had the PR advantage of having their most visible anchormen on the scene, <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON> and Rather. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> covered <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION> being shut down. <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION> carried lengthy coverage of its own negotiations to stay on the air, as did <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> _ 14 minutes' worth during the season finale of `` <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>.'' `` We actually saw what happens when institutional authorities confront the media,'' said <PERSON> Gitlin </PERSON>. `` We saw it unfolding in real time. We saw these functionaries arrive from some Chinese bureau, we found them telling the <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION> people to fold it up, we saw the <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION> guy on the phone to his boss in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, we saw that whole exchange. I think we very rarely to see what happens when institutions are at work. If the media did the same thing in the case of lots of other events, then I think they would be doing a great deal to educate a democratic republic.'' `` The rap on TV is that TV becomes the story,'' said <PERSON> Lichter </PERSON>. `` But this is a story that's even bigger than <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rather </PERSON>. I mean, this is a story so big that the presence of TV, I think, does n't really change it that much It just means we're better informed than we would be if TV was n't there.'' <PERSON> Gitlin </PERSON> recalls that the networks toned down their coverage of anti-war protests after the Democratic Convention in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> in 1968 out of fear they were `` amplifying the sense of dissension. ... Clearly when it comes to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, they're not concerned that they might be amplifying division. It's very clear to them who are the good guys and who are the bad guys.'' `` Part of the difficulty is it's hard to find people who are defending the <ORGANIZATION> Li </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peng </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- hard-line -RRB- faction of the government,'' said <PERSON> Brokaw </PERSON>. `` He's not available, his spokesmen are not available, the embassy here has clammed up. And there are any number of people who are willing to be critical of repression and martial law. So in that regard, I suppose you could make the case that the coverage does appear to be sympathetic _ but that's because the events are sympathetic.''

 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy grew at a moderate 4.3 percent annual rate in the first three months of the year, the government said in a report economists and the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration saw as a sign the country's record peacetime expansion is continuing.

<TEXT>
 Real estate tycoon <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> plans to spend millions of dollars to give his new Trump Shuttle `` the best of everything'' and may attempt to buy more assets of strike-torn <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. `` You're going to see the friendliest airline, you're going to see the best managed airline there is,'' <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> said Thursday. `` I think the service is going to be fantastic.'' The $ 365 million deal for the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York-Washington-Boston </ORGANIZATION> shuttle should close in about two weeks and the airline should be operating as the new Trump Shuttle soon after, he said. `` We intend to have the best of everything,'' <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> told a news conference at his opulent Plaza Hotel in midtown <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> also indicated a possible interest in buying other <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> assets, such as more planes, saying, `` We're looking at different elements of Eastern.'' Trump Shuttle President <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Nobles </PERSON> said <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> hopes to capture 75 percent of the shuttle market that is split with <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> after one year of operation, but he called the target `` a little ambitious.'' The shuttle is used mainly by business travelers and was <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s only consistently profitable operation before the March 4 strike by its Machinists, which was joined by its pilots and flight attendants unions. The Eastern shuttle lost many passengers to <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION>'s rival shuttle because of the walkout and now has less than a 25 percent market share. <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> has pledged to upgrade the shuttle, whose fleet of 21 aging, blue-and-silver <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727s will be refurbished and painted with red, black and gold stripes and <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>'s name on the tail. `` We're going to be spending millions of dollars on each plane,'' <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> said. He also repeated a pledge to exceed federal regulations in checking each jet for safety. `` I'm elated about it. I've been unemployed for three months; it's a relief,'' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanford </PERSON>, a striking <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> pilot from <LOCATION> Marietta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, who is one of 170 pilots tentatively hired by Trump Shuttle. <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>, who owns several casino-hotels in <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, also operates a helicopter service between <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and that resort city. He said he is interested in possibly routing the shuttle to <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> on weekends. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Bankruptcy Judge <PERSON> Burton </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lifland </PERSON> on Thursday formally approved the sale to <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>, which followed withdrawal of a rival $ 415 million buyout proposal from <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, which could not arrange financing. Miami-based <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> first agreed to sell <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> the shuttle last October, but the deal was delayed by court challenges from <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s unions and the need for bankruptcy court approval. Eastern officials have said the strapped airline would net around $ 300 million from the shuttle sale after paying lease obligations and other related expenses. Eastern filed for bankruptcy protection from its creditors March 9. Eastern's unions wanted the airline sold as a single entity. But in addition to the shuttle sale, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s parent <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> has decided to sell about $ 1.4 billion in other assets separately as part of a plan to build a smaller carrier. Union representatives are holding discussions with two investor groups that have submitted formal bids for all of Eastern.

<HEAD>Bethlehem Steel Chairman Defends Wage Increases</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Bethlehem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> says a doubling of productivity since steelworkers had their last wage increase in 1982 helps take the sting out of its newly ratified labor contract. While the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steelworkers </ORGANIZATION> union was counting ballots Thursday, <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION>'s competitors were criticizing the contract's terms in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> at the annual conference of the American Iron and <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> By a margin of nearly 4-1, 11,386-3 ,009, union members ratified a 50-month package that raises average base wages by $ 2.50 per hour to $ 13.72 by July 1993 `` It was certainly rich enough,'' <ORGANIZATION> LTV </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. President <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoag </PERSON> said Thursday `` It covered a lot of things.'' <ORGANIZATION> Bethlehem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said the added costs of the contract can be offset by a modest increase of $ 18 per ton in steel prices over the next four years. <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION>'s prices now average slightly more than $ 500 per ton, he said. `` I frankly do n't understand how anyone could expect us not to have some increase in our labor costs after being flat for six years,'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> also is nearing a contract agreement with the <ORGANIZATION> USW </ORGANIZATION>. An announcement could come as early as today on terms influenced by the <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION> settlement, according to sources who spoke on condition they not be identified. Contracts at National, <ORGANIZATION> Inland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Armco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> expire July 31, the same deadline <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION> faced. The 20,500 <ORGANIZATION> USW </ORGANIZATION> members at the nation's second-largest steelmaker won an immediate base wage increase of $ 1 per hour, or 8 percent, to $ 12.22 an hour as a restoration of past sacrifices. The base wage will rise by $ 1 on Jan. 1, 1991, and by 50 cents on Jan. 1, 1992. They get an immediate $ 500 signing bonus and a $ 500 advance on profit-sharing payments. Pension and medical benefits will be sweetened, and three paid holidays and Sunday premium pay will be restored over the contract life. Increased payments early in the contract are mostly obligations from earlier sacrifices, and the workers will not see new money until 1991, <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Executive Vice President <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON>, formerly chief labor negotiator for the entire steel industry, called the <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION> agreement unfortunate One steel executive, speaking privately, called the terms tragic. The hourly increases amount to 4.6 percent per year, and prices would have to increase only 3.8 percent per year to offset the new costs, one analyst said. Depending on inflation and profit-sharing, the new contract could raise the company's average labor costs from around $ 26.50 per hour now to $ 31.60 per hour when it expires in July 31, 1993, according to studies, Industry-wide labor costs averaged $ 24.56 per hour in 1988, according to the <ORGANIZATION> AISI </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said the pact also provides for plant-level negotiations to streamline work rules and further improve productivity. Productivity has roughly doubled since 1982, lessening the impact of labor costs on total production costs, he said. The company can produce a ton of steel with the equivalent of one man working four hours. That's down from around 8 man-hours per ton six years ago.

<HEAD>No TV Ads in California Classrooms, Schools Chief Says</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s chief educator says he will withhold state funds from schools that show an experimental television news program for teen-agers that includes a daily dose of commercials. The creators of Channel One want to offer the 12-minute-a-day show to schools nationwide, providing satellite dishes, television sets and video recorders in exchange for a guarantee students will watch the program daily. But <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Honig </PERSON>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s superintendent of public education, said Thursday he would withhold some state money from public schools that agree to accept the show billed by its makers as an innovative educational tool. Mandatory viewing of ads runs counter to state law defining schools' educational mission, he said. <PERSON> Honig </PERSON> can not order local school districts to ban the show. But his control of state funds for education gives him considerable influence. <PERSON> Honig </PERSON> said Channel One, a for-profit venture by <ORGANIZATION> Whittle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Knoxville </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, would in effect put teachers and school administrators in the position of endorsing commercial products. `` The whole reason for this is to have access to kids' minds, our youngsters' minds,'' <PERSON> Honig </PERSON> said. `` We would be ceding control of our curriculum to a commercial enterprise.'' Whittle, which tested the teen-oriented news show in six schools across the country this spring, said company lawyers have checked <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> law and disagree with <PERSON> Honig </PERSON>'s interpretation. `` To come out and reject something that's not even in existence seems to us to be a little bit premature,'' Whittle spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Jarrard </PERSON> said. Teachers who took part in the test screenings have given the show rave reviews. But several mainstream educational organizations, including the national <ORGANIZATION> Parent-Teacher </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Secondary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Principals </ORGANIZATION>, oppose widespread adoption of Channel One. The show's youthful newscasters present the events of the day, with an emphasis on how they affect teens. It runs 10 minutes plus two minutes of ads for blue jeans, candy, hamburgers and other products. In exchange for a guarantee students will watch the show daily, each school gets a satellite TV dish to receive Channel One and other programs, a video recorder and a color television set for each participating classroom. The package is valued at $ 50,000 per school. <PERSON> Honig </PERSON> would block Channel One from the state's 4.5 million students by using his authority over state grants that are made to individual schools on the basis of attendance. If every high-school student in the state watched Channel One, grants for the time spent would amount to $ 29.8 million, <PERSON> Honig </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration will address barriers to exports of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> autos, even though cars are n't expressly on an official list of products subject to unfair trade restrictions, Sen. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON> says. The long-awaited list, announced Thursday, targets trade barriers in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> to fulfill a new <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade law in a move that could mean huge tariffs against some foreign products. <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON>, D-Mich., played a key role in placing the new provision, known as Super 301, in the trade bill passed last year The law requires the administration to identify the most harmful trade barriers and gives the administration 18 months to negotiate the removal of the barriers. The list of harmful trade practices in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> named satellites, supercomputers and forest products as areas that had suffered from Japanese trading practices. It omitted the automotive sector, which accounts for almost two-thirds of the $ 55 billion <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade imbalance with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. But <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON> aides said the inclusion of distribution systems on the agenda ensured automotive issues would be addressed in negotiations with <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> on trade barriers built into the Japanese regulatory and marketing system. Closed distribution is one of the greatest barriers the industry faces to entry into the Japanese market. `` The Super 301 process is having the effect I intended when it was written,'' <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON> said. `` While other countries could and should be listed, this initial list is a key step forward.'' <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's third largest automaker, said in a statement it was encouraged that distribution systems in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> were included on the trade-imbalance list. `` <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> will, over the next 12 months, aggressively attempt to fulfill its commitment to break into the Japanese market as we have in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>,'' the company said. `` If we are not successful in cracking this market, we will still have the option to refile for Super 301 designation of auto distribution as a priority practice,'' <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> said. If administration talks fail to produce results in 18 months, the government can levy tariffs of up to 100 percent against selected imports from an offending country. Automobiles and auto parts are not on the formal list and so would not come under the 18-month rule. The list had its critics, including <PERSON> Nobuo </PERSON> <PERSON> Matsunaga </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Japanese </LOCATION> ambassador to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` In light of the good-faith efforts that have been made, the government of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and the Japanese people are greatly disappointed by this one-sided decision,'' <PERSON> Matsunaga </PERSON> said in a news release. `` There may well be some domestic backlash in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> which will make the resolution of the various problems even more difficult.''

<HEAD>Universal Claiming Victory; Others Not So Sure</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MILWAUKEE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Universal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> officials are claiming victory in their six-month battle against a hostile takeover by <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Voltage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineering </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. But others see possible further moves by High Voltage despite this week's federal appeals court ruling in favor of the Milwaukee-based <ORGANIZATION> Universal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION>. `` I think they have to raise their price,'' <ORGANIZATION> Milwaukee </ORGANIZATION> investment analyst <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> McDevitt </PERSON> said. `` The court, in effect, has said it does n't think much of the Universal defense. `` If they -LRB- High Voltage -RRB- raise the price to, say, $ 40 or $ 41, that has got to get the attention of the Universal board. I do n't think the board can stonewall that,'' <PERSON> McDevitt </PERSON> said High Voltage has offered to buy Universal stock at $ 38 a share, a deal valued at about $ 750 million. Universal stock dropped $ 1.75 a share on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> Thursday to $ 35. The ruling by the 7th <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> affirmed a March 18 decision by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stadtmueller </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION> upholding the constitutionality of <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>'s anti-takeover law. It left unchanged the lower court's decision upholding Universal's shareholder rights plan <PERSON> Terrence </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Reilly </PERSON>, vice president and general counsel for Universal, said Thursday that the offer by <ORGANIZATION> Amanda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Acquisition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a High Voltage subsidiary formed for the acquisition of Universal, could not proceed after the court decision. `` Amanda's offer for Universal can not proceed in light of its defeat in the <ORGANIZATION> 7th </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>'' in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, <PERSON> O'Reilly </PERSON> said. `` Amanda's counsel told the <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> that if the <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> Business Combination Statute were upheld, its takeover offer would be ` doomed.' The court relied on the statement in disposing of the case. `` Unless <PERSON> Amanda </PERSON> was misleading the <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>, its offer is over.'' But High Voltage officials said only that they were reviewing their options. An unidentified High Voltage legal adviser quoted by the <ORGANIZATION> Milwaukee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sentinel </ORGANIZATION> mentioned the possibility of filing a motion asking that the appeals court rule on the legality of the anti-takeover defense used by Universal. High Voltage, based in <LOCATION> Burlington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, and headed by <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> investors, has extended the tender offer several times since it was first made last December. The offer, scheduled to expire June 6, is conditional on getting judicial issues resolved. `` The court found that although the statute may well be economic folly, it is constitutional,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Clifford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, High Voltage deputy chairman. `` While not deciding the poison-pill case, the opinion does cast serious doubt on Universal's ` just-say-no' defense. In light of the court decision, we are reviewing our options,'' he said. <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Osborn </PERSON>, Universal president and chief executive officer, said company leaders feel `` shareholders will profit most if Universal remains independent to pursue its highly successful business plan which delivered a 30 percent increase in earnings per share last year, will do so again this year, and indicated a 20 percent increase against next year.'' In a 21-page decision, Appeals Judge <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Easterbrook </PERSON> said `` <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>'s law may well be folly; we are confident that it is constitutional.'' <ORGANIZATION> Universal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION> manufactures and markets food ingredients and selected consumer food items.

 Share prices were modestly higher at midday Friday in light volume. However, dealers said the approaching start to the three-day holiday weekend in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> kept most share price movements confined to a narrow range. `` There's not much business around except for a bit of strength where there has been a lack of stock in the market or where certain stocks have had good press coverage lately,'' said one chief British equities dealer at a large <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> brokerage firm. At about noon in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times-Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> 100-share index was up 3.8 points, or 0.2 percent, at 2,140.4, off its early morning best level of 2,143.9, but above the midmorning minimum of 2,137.6. Volume came to a light 274.6 million shares by midday compared with 278 million shares at the same time Thursday.

 An investor group including <ORGANIZATION> Mary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kay </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cosmetics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> says it wants to acquire rival <ORGANIZATION> Avon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which last week rejected a $ 2.1 billion takeover bid from <ORGANIZATION> Amway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rochon </PERSON>, vice chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Mary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kay </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, parent of the cosmetics company, late Thursday made public a letter to <PERSON> Avon </PERSON> saying the investor group has had talks with <PERSON> Avon </PERSON> about a possible takeover No figures were mentioned in the letter, which was sent to Avon Chairman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Preston </PERSON>. Avon spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Cox </PERSON> said the company would have no comment on <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Kay </PERSON>'s interest at least until after the matter was discussed at a regularly scheduled board meeting on June 1. In response to <ORGANIZATION> Amway </ORGANIZATION>'s offer, <PERSON> Preston </PERSON> stated that <PERSON> Avon </PERSON> was n't for sale. The letter said <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> and <PERSON> Avon </PERSON> each would maintain separate sales forces and identities if an acquisition were successful. On Wednesday, stock speculators bid Avon shares higher following a report that the cosmetics company may be the target of a hostile takeover attempt. `` We have never before publicly disclosed either our interest in <LOCATION> Avon </LOCATION> or the fact or content of any of the discussions we or our financial advisors, the <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, have had with <PERSON> Avon </PERSON> or its advisors,'' the letter said. `` However, because recent press accounts involving <PERSON> Avon </PERSON> referred to <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> <PERSON> Cosmetics </PERSON>, the company now feels it necessary to advise the people who are key to its success _ its sales force _ of the nature of its interest in <LOCATION> Avon </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Rochon </PERSON> said. If a bid were successful, Avon would be directed by <ORGANIZATION> Argonaut </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION>, an investment arm of <ORGANIZATION> Mary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kay </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cosmetics </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Rochon </PERSON> said. He said <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> sales directors were notified about the interest in <LOCATION> Avon </LOCATION> on Thursday. On Wednesday, following a <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Today </ORGANIZATION> report that investor <PERSON> Irwin </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> and an unidentified `` major company'' planned to launch a joint bid for Avon at $ 40 a share, Avon stock soared on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> in heavy trading. Avon dropped 75 cents to $ 35.12 -LCB- in composite <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> trading Thursday after gaining $ 1.37 -LCB- the previous day. <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Today </ORGANIZATION> had reported that <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> and the unidentified company were in the process of completing financing and other details of the hostile offer. <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON>' partner was said to be a company other than <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Kay </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Amway </ORGANIZATION> last week was rebuffed by <PERSON> Avon </PERSON> in a $ 39-a-share takeover offer that valued <PERSON> Avon </PERSON> at $ 2.1 billion. <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> owns 10.3 percent of <PERSON> Avon </PERSON>'s common stock through a partnership with <ORGANIZATION> Amway </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Amway </ORGANIZATION>, an Ada, Mich.-based direct selling firm, withdrew its offer after <PERSON> Avon </PERSON>'s rejection.

 <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> angrily refused today to negotiate to avoid trade sanctions under terms set by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> said it may haul <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> into international trade court. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on Thursday named <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> as unfair traders that must negotiate to remove barriers within 18 months or face possible sanctions, including tariffs of up to 100 percent on selected goods. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> joined <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> in criticizing the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> action. Commerce Minister <PERSON> Dinesh </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> said it was `` totally unjustified, irrational and unfair.'' The Japanese Foreign Ministry summoned <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Armacost </PERSON> today to explain the government's position, said ministry spokesman <PERSON> Taizo </PERSON> <PERSON> Watanabe </PERSON>. `` The government of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> has no intention of entering into negotiations with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> under the conditions imposed under Super 301,'' <PERSON> Hiroshi </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitsuzuka </PERSON>, minister of international trade and industry, said in a statement. `` Super 301'' refers to the provision of the 1988 U.S. Omnibus Trade Act allowing the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to target countries and practices that block American exports. The <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and other countries have said the unilateral nature of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> law may violate the provisions of the international General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, or <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION>. If sanctions are imposed under Super 301, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> may bring a complaint before <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION>, which is supposed to help resolve trade disputes, <PERSON> Watanabe </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Watanabe </PERSON> was not as confrontational as <PERSON> Mitsuzuka </PERSON>, however. Although <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> will not negotiate under terms of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> law, it may propose `` quiet talks and joint cooperation'' that may `` coincide with'' the negotiations <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> demands, <PERSON> Watanabe </PERSON> said. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Sousuke </PERSON> <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> called the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> action `` extremely regrettable,'' and said it was designed to draw attention away from a large source of the trade imbalance, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> budget deficit. `` As a result of many market-opening measures that have been taken to date, the Japanese market has now become a widely open market,'' <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> told reporters. `` The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> itself maintains import restrictive measures and practices to a considerable degree,'' he said. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> was targeted for unfair trade practices in supercomputers, satellites and lumber. But officials cited increases in Japanese purchases of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> goods and expressed anger at <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> charges of unfairness. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> is launching five <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> communications and broadcasting satellites this year, `` which proves our satellite market is open to foreign companies,'' said Posts and Telecommunications Minister <PERSON> Seiichi </PERSON> <PERSON> Kataoka </PERSON>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> charges that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s policy of encouraging a domestic space industry prohibits the purchase of foreign satellites if they interfere with `` indigenous development objectives,'' effectively limiting <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> access to the market. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> will buy eight <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> supercomputers within three years, the government announced earlier this month. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> says that through a variety of exclusionary practices, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> has `` thwarted the open procurement process'' of supercomputers. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> statement also said <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s import licensing system `` inhibits market access and creates uncertainty for <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. exporters.'' It criticized <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> for requiring government approval of all new or expanded foreign investment. <PERSON> Dinesh </PERSON>, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s commerce ministerm said <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> had no right to blame his country for blocking <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> imports when the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> does the same thing with Indian imports. `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>' action is particularly surprising because the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> itself has built and retained a variety of barriers against access to its markets. It is hardly in a position to ask others to lift barriers without doing so itself,'' <PERSON> Dinesh </PERSON> said in a statement. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has a trade deficit of about $ 700 million with <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and a $ 52 billion deficit with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. Last year, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> exported $ 3.2 billion in goods to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exports to Indian was about $ 2.5 billion.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, urging <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> to open their markets to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> products, said today that negotiations aimed at ending unfair trade practices will begin with the three countries on June 16. The Japanese trade minister declared, however, that his government would refuse to take part in such talks under duress. The administration singled out the three nations Thursday night for priority action under a 1988 trade law that calls for penalties against countries that are deemed to be especially protectionist. `` Our goal is to open markets and to eliminate trade barriers. We oppose protectionism in any and all forms. Therefore, I urge the governments of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> to work constructively with us to resolve these issues expeditiously,'' the president said in a statement announcing the negotiation date as he left on a trip to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The 1988 Omnibus Trade Act requires the administration to issue what amounts to a hit list that names the countries whose trade barriers are most harmful to American producers. The government then has 18 months to negotiate away the barriers. Failure of the talks could lead to tariffs of up to 100 percent on selected exports from the offending countries. Announcing the action, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Trade Representative <PERSON> Carla </PERSON> <PERSON> A </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hills </PERSON> told reporters, `` This exercise is not intended to be offensive. I hope there is no backlash.'' However, Japanese Ambassador <PERSON> Nobuo </PERSON> <PERSON> Matsunaga </PERSON> issued a statement calling the decision to include his country `` extremely regrettable.'' In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Hiroshi </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitsuzuka </PERSON>, minister of international trade and industry, said in a statement: `` The government of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> has no intention of entering into negotiations with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> under the conditions imposed -LRB- in the law -RRB-.'' <PERSON> Taizo </PERSON> <PERSON> Watanabe </PERSON>, spokesman for the Japanese <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, was less emphatic, saying that while <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> will not negotiate under terms of the law, it may propose `` quiet talks and joint cooperation'' that may `` coincide with'' the negotiations <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> wants. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> joined <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> in criticizing the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> action. Commerce Minister <PERSON> Dinesh </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> said it was `` totally unjustified, irrational and unfair.'' <PERSON> Hills </PERSON> also announced the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would be watching closely 25 countries suspected of failing to protect <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> copyrights and patents and said the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration would reveal the status of the eight most flagrant ones in November. The Japanese lobbied in recent weeks to stay off the list of top trade violators. They were less successful, however, than the Koreans, who made a number of trade concessions in recent days and did manage to avoid inclusion. `` In light of the good faith efforts that have been made, the government of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and the Japanese people are greatly disappointed by this one-sided decision,'' <PERSON> Matsunaga </PERSON> said. `` There may well be some domestic backlash in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> which will make the resolution of the various problemseven more difficult.'' <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> was cited for its refusal to buy <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> supercomputers and satellites as well as its barriers to purchase of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wood products. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> ran a trade deficit of $ 52 billion last year with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, or 44 percent of the $ 119.8 billion <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade imbalance. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> was cited for barriers that bar foreign investment and the closing of its insurance market to foreign companies. The administration cited <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> for quotas on imports and licensing restrictions. <PERSON> Hills </PERSON> said the administration plans `` to immediately commence negotiations on all of this that we have identified'' but added that there was no certainty that they could succeed. `` I have no assurance,'' she said. `` I have only my own good will and I hope we can approach these negotiations with a constructive dialogue.'' Besides citing <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> for flagrant trade barriers, the administration placed eight countries on a `` priority watch list'' of nations that have failed to protect <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> copyrights and patents. It declined, however, to target any countries for priority action on that issue. It did establish a lesser `` watch list'' of 17 other countries that have not established safeguards against infringement on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> copyrights and patents. The president also has directed <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> officials to open separate negotiations with the Japanese on eliminating `` structural impediments'' to sales of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> goods within their economy. The impediments range from pricing mechanisms to bid rigging. In his statement today, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials looked at `` a large number of practices'' that ultimately were not listed _ including Japanese rice quotas and the subsidies given by the European Community to the manufacturers of Airbus airliners. He said it was felt they could be better addressed through existing international trade forums. On <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> sponsors of the trade law reacted favorably to the administration's action. `` I expect we'll hear howls of outrage from both sides on this, claims the action was either rash or timid,'' <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, said in a statement. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> called the move `` only a first step but an important one in establishing an effective trade policy. ... We've let the world know where our priorities lie when it comes to opening markets.'' Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Danforth </PERSON>, R-Mo., called the action `` a very positive first step,'' and Sen. <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Baucus </PERSON>, D-Mont., said `` I think the administration deserves a passing They are stepping up to the problem.'' Elsewhere in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, however, voices of dissent suggested that the administration had not gone far enough. Sen. <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Levin </PERSON>, D-Mich., said he was `` disappointed'' that <PERSON> Hills </PERSON> `` left off so many other unfair Japanese trade practices from the list, including auto parts and construction services. Rep. <PERSON> Sander </PERSON> <PERSON> Levin </PERSON>, D-Mich., said the decision `` is more a compromise among factions within the administration than a clear message to our trading partners and a clear policy for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. The president's chief economic adviser, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Boskin </PERSON>, and budget director <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> had argued strenuously that targeting <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> would do more harm than good, while <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON> called for a tough crackdown. <PERSON> Danforth </PERSON> told reporters, however, he saw nothing unusual about disagreement within an administration before such a decision. Sen. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON>, D-Mich., said the targeting of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> showed that the trade law `` is beginning to produce important results. Ways and <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON>, D-Ill., called the plan `` a positive first step toward dismantling foreign trade barriers. Countries named to the priority watch list for patents and copyrights were <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Ford Stops Production at Two Escort Plants, First Time in 6 Years</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: UPDATES throughout with Wayne plant scheduled shutdown.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DEARBORN, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said today it will halt production temporarily at two plants to shrink inventories of its Escort subcompact car, last year's most popular automobile. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Windecker </PERSON> said production at the company's <LOCATION> Edison </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, plant stopped Monday and is to resume June 5 On that date, the company's plant in <LOCATION> Wayne </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, will stop production for a week. The two plants are the only ones making the Escort. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> has about a 100-day supply of Escorts at the current selling rate, <PERSON> Windecker </PERSON> said. The shutdowns are the first in six years in which <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> has closed any plant to reduce inventory. Plants typically shut down in late summer to retool for the next model year. In 1988, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> sold 387,815 Escorts, making it the most popular vehicle behind <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> and Chevrolet pickup trucks. Through May 20 of this year, Escorts were selling at a pace 5.1 percent behind last year's. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> has about 1,500 workers at the Edison plant and about 3,000 at the <LOCATION> Wayne </LOCATION> plant. `` The subcompact market is running below expectations,'' <PERSON> Windecker </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> officials said in April that an average of 10 percent to 15 percent of the cars it sells are built on overtime. In the past, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> has reduced inventories of specific models by slowing the assembly line or trimming overtime. That strategy failed with the Escort.

 The stock market gained ground today in fairly quiet pre-holiday trading. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 8.06 to 2,490.65 by 11 a.m. on Wall Street. Gainers outnumbered losers by about 9 to 5 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed issues, with 734 up, 397 down and 560 unchanged. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 52.02 million shares at midmorning. Activity was expected to taper off through the day as many traders got an early start on the long Memorial Day weekend. The markets will be closed on Monday. Prices and interest rates were mixed, showing generally small changes, in the credit markets today. But stocks seemed to benefiting from speculation that the recent downturn in rates might go further soon, with encouragement from the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>. The economy has showed signs of slowing lately, as <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> policymakers have intended. Furthermore, some observers think the central bank might want to ease credit in order to slow the recent sharp rise of the dollar in foreign exchange. <ORGANIZATION> Sea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Containers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> jumped 8 | to 56 The European companies <ORGANIZATION> Tiphook </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Stena </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AB </ORGANIZATION> made a $ 50-a-share offer for <ORGANIZATION> Sea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Containers </ORGANIZATION>, and traders quickly bid up the price in anticipation of a possible higher offer.

<HEAD>Despite Market Rally, Brokerage Stocks Languish</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Many investors may be celebrating the stock market's recent comeback, but there's little to shout about for people who bet on the securities industry itself. Share prices of most publicly held investment firms, particularly those that do a large amount of their business with the public, linger far below their peaks earlier in the 1980s. For example, <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION>, around $ 30 last week, is trading for barely half its 1983 high of $ 56.50. <ORGANIZATION> Salomon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a pre-eminent investment banker, stood recently around $ 26, vs. a high just three years ago of $ 59.50. The stock of <ORGANIZATION> Charles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Schwab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the largest of the discount brokers, has rallied from a post-crash $ 5.75 to $ 11.75 as of late last week. That's still quite a way short, however, of the $ 16.50 price it commanded when it was first offered to the public in September of 1987. There's no mystery about all this to regular readers of the financial pages. While stock prices have risen sharply in the past six months, most sources of brokers' income remain depressed. Individual investors are still wary or just plain turned off. Competition for business from investing institutions has shaved commissions on their trades razor-thin. `` Continued sluggishness in capital and consumer market activity, combined with a barrage of negative articles in the press concerning the near-term outlook for the brokerage business, has kept pressure on the brokerage stocks,'' said <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Eckenfelder </PERSON>, an analyst who follows the industry for <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>. For firms such as <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> PaineWebber </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Eckenfelder </PERSON> observed in his current monthly report on the group, `` the story is still the same. `` In order for earnings to move upward in a meaningful way from current levels, the retail business must gain momentum.'' The Value Line Investment Survey, which has just published its quarterly appraisal of the securities industry, ranks it 83rd out of 92 groups it follows for likely stock-price performance over the next 12 months. `` Ever since the stock market collapsed in October 1987, trading volume has been severely depressed,'' the investment advisory service observed. `` But, at least among the big Wall Street firms, mergers and acquisitions -LRB- and the hefty fees they bring in -RRB- have been picking up the slack. `` Now some wariness has set in: Will <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> limit the size of buyouts? Will rising interest rates make haevy debt burdens too risky? `` Although there are n't yet any definitive answers to these questions, merger and acquisition activity has been on the back burner since the start of the year. In the first quarter, for example, the number of transactions dropped 30 percent from the year-ago quarter, and dollar volume fell 58 percent. `` Many companies report there are enough deals in the pipeline so that second quarter results should show an increase, but at this point we're not expecting 1989 to catch up to 1988.'' A telling gauge of the state of Wall Street is the price of a seat, or membership, at the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. On May 9, a seat changed hands for $ 500,000, less than half the pre-crash record of $ 1.15 million. `` Seat prices have a volatile history, in line with the boom-bust cycles that regularly recur in the securities business,'' noted <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Connolly </PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in a recent commentary. `` In 1977 times were so bad that an <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> seat sold for $ 35,000, or slightly less than the price of a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> taxi medallion. `` For those who insist that history must repeat itself, we would note that cab medallions are bid at $ 140,000.''

<HEAD>Grains Higher On Word of Soviet Interest in Wheat</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Grain and soybean futures opened higher this morning on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>. Wheat prices rose in early trading as word swept the floor that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> was in the market for spring wheat. However, wheat futures drifted downward as trading picked up. Corn futures received a boost from heavy rains yesterday in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>. The rain could further delay the planting of corn crops in those states. Corn futures were also getting support from good cash prices, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Frazier </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Balfour </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maclaine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. Soybean prices were being helped by the weakening dollar. Analysts say the surge in the dollar's value in recent weeks slowed the pace of soybean exports. In early trading, wheat was 1 -LCB- cents to 2 -RCB- cents lower with the contract for delivery in July at $ 3.94 a bushel; corn was 1 cent to 2 -LCB- cents higher with July at $ 2.66 a bushel; oats were 1 cent to 1 -LCB- cents higher with July at $ 1.74 -LCB- a bushel; soybeans were a \ cent to 7 cents higher wtih July at $ 7.08 -LCB- a bushel. Livestock and pork futures were lower in early trading on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Live cattle were .03 cent lower to .17 cent higher with June at 69.37 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .07 cent to .20 cent lower with August at 77.65 cents a pound; hogs were .10 cent to .47 cent lower with June at 47.95 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .62 to .80 cent lower with July at 31.37 cents a pound. Livestock prices settled mostly higher Thursday and pork futures were lower.

 <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> T </ORGANIZATION> and its unions today reported progress in their contract talks, with the company amending its benefits package and the unions making a number of counter offers as the Saturday expiration of current pacts drew closer. `` There's been a lot more movement today than there was -LRB- Thursday -RRB-,'' <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Francine </PERSON> <PERSON> Zucker </PERSON> said. `` I think we're going to get very close and we may reach a settlement, but that can change quickly.'' Still to be resolved are major differences over wages and a company demand that workers pay more for health care. `` We are not as far apart as we were but we're nowhere near where we want to be,'' Ms. <PERSON> Zucker </PERSON> said. The company, moving to answer some of the unions' job-security concerns, amended its contract offer to include limits on the use of temporary workers, an <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T spokeswoman said. The company also proposed several changes to its benefits package, spokeswoman <PERSON> Edith </PERSON> <PERSON> Herman </PERSON> said as negotiators for the company and two unions continued talks aimed at reaching a new contract before current pacts for about 160,000 workers expire Saturday. Ms. <PERSON> Herman </PERSON> could not provide specifics of the new company proposals but said <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Telegraph was offering to regulate the use of temporary help, improvements to its eye and dental care programs, a more liberal leave policy to care for newborn babies and a new leave program to care for sick relatives. Ms. <PERSON> Zucker </PERSON> said those proposals were being reviewed and that the unions likely would make counter offers later today. On Thursday, the unions renewed their attack on <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> T </ORGANIZATION>'s health care proposal, which would shift some costs to employers but leave in place existing caps on the maximum they would have to pay in a given year. `` AT & amp; T spends megabucks urging Americans to reach out and call our relatives to make sure they're OK, but the only reaching the company is doing is into its employees' pockets,'' <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brotherhood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electrical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> said as the unions accused <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T of withholding data on its medical care costs. But an <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> T </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said the company had produced most of the information requested by the unions and was in the process of compiling the rest. Despite the public optimism, both sides are making extensive preparations for a strike. Union leaders have hinted they will not call a walkout immediately but likely would do so if an agreement is not reached within a week or so after the contracts expire. `` A strike remains a weapon but it is a weapon of last resort,'' Ms. <PERSON> Zucker </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T, from its <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> operations center, is preparing management `` emergency teams'' to fill in for striking workers if there is a walkout, and the company has plans in place to complete all major business installations scheduled for the next five weeks, spokesman <PERSON> Herb </PERSON> <PERSON> Linnen </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Linnen </PERSON> said the breakdown of the workers represented by the unions was: _ 21,500 long-distance operators _ 35,500 field and in-house technicians _ About 37,000 production workers in factories that make long-distance switching and transmission equipment, the area of <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T operations likely to be hit hardest in the event of a strike `` It's pretty difficult to run an assembly line if the picket lines are being honored on a high percentage basis,'' said <PERSON> Linnen </PERSON>, who said the plants would be kept open nonetheless. _ About 54,000 other union workers in jobs ranging from clerical, administrative and sales staff to sales representatives in <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T retail sales outlets <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T's manufacturing of residential phones is done in <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> and would not be affected by a strike. Inventory for the equipment manufactured in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is `` sparse,'' <PERSON> Linnen </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Linnen </PERSON> sad management personnel would fill in for strikers. However, he would not provide a breakdown of how they would be assigned. In the event of a strike, customers who directly dial long-distance calls should experience no significant service problems, but those needing operator assistance could face delays at peak hours, union and company officials said. <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T, which holds about 70 percent of the long-distance market, handles about 80 million calls on a normal business day. Ms. <PERSON> Zucker </PERSON> said during a 26-day <ORGANIZATION> CWA </ORGANIZATION> strike in 1986 `` some of the managers who replaced operators proved they could do the job, others did not. They are forced to work double shifts in unfamiliar jobs, and the added stress would have an impact on the quality of service.''

 <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boone </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> says he will take his fight for representation on <ORGANIZATION> Koito </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s board to the annual meeting of the Japanese auto parts manufacturer. `` There's no doubt they do n't want an American on the inside,'' <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> said Thursday. `` We've made it clear that <ORGANIZATION> Boone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> intends to be a long-term holder, but I'm getting the impression management and its friends have something to hide.'' The takeover strategist, who has sought a seat on the board since his <ORGANIZATION> Boone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> became the company's largest single shareholder with 20.2 percent of the outstanding stock, complained that on Wednesday <ORGANIZATION> Koito </ORGANIZATION> granted a <ORGANIZATION> Matsushita </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industrial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> representative a seat on the board although the Japanese company has just 5.3 percent of the stock. <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> requested three seats on the board, the same number held by <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which has 19.2 percent of stock in <LOCATION> Koito </LOCATION>. He said in a statement the denial `` is sending a clear signal by <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s major corporations that they have no respect or interest in American investors.'' Spokesman <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Helmke </PERSON> said the company had first tried to limit <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> to sending only one person to the meeting, but has since agreed to allow him two people so he can bring an interpreter. But <PERSON> Helmke </PERSON> said he expected <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> will try to attend the meeting with his partners in <ORGANIZATION> Boone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` I see nothing wrong with Toyota or any other Japanese company investing in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> said. `` But I also believe investment has to be a two-way street. In today's global economy, no country can afford to keep other investors and other manufacturers out for long. `` If <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s corporate leaders do n't open up, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> is going to get left behind, and I doubt the Japanese public will stand for that for too long.'' Since <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> acquired his stake in <ORGANIZATION> Koito </ORGANIZATION>, he has been urging government action to force <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to open its doors to foreign investment. <PERSON> Helmke </PERSON> said <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> is encouraged by the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration's decision Thursday to include <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> on a list of countries who trade practices are most harmful to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy

 The man who helped transform <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s cornfields and pastures into the phenomenon known as the shopping mall says he is upbeat about the future of his industry and the economy <PERSON> Melvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, who started in the shopping center game 30 years ago by leasing launderettes and developing small centers anchored by discount stores, launches his most ambitious project in June with groundbreaking for the Mall of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. He says the <LOCATION> Bloomington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, mall will be <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s largest _ big enough to include its own enclosed theme park. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>'s giant new 4.2 million square-foot Mall of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> was one of the star attractions at the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shopping </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> convention in <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>. It shared billing with other major <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> properties, including a major project he will be developing in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and a look at the unique renovation of the old <PERSON> Gimbel </PERSON>'s building in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s famed Herald Square. `` I'm very upbeat about the economy,'' <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> said as he stood in front of his company's booth at the annual conclave for shopping center developers, builders and retailers. `` Everything goes in cycles but I feel excited about the future. You do n't lease -LRB- a center -RRB- depending on today's economy, but on what the future holds. The glass is half filled.'' How many shopping centers does Indianapolis-based <ORGANIZATION> Melvin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Simon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Associates own or manage? <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> turns to an employee standing at his side. He's either lost track or is testing the employee. `` We have 207 centers in 38 states,'' the employee responds. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> smiles. The numbers make <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> one of the largest managers and developers of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> shopping centers. Not bad for the Brooklyn-born, Bronx-raised son of a tailor who chose to stay in <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION> after a tour of military duty there. He convinced brother <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> to join him in selling space for an <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION> shopping center developer, and in 1960 started his own company. Today, <PERSON> Melvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, 62, is chairman of the company that bears his name and <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON>, 53, is president. <PERSON> Melvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> owns two-thirds of his company and <ORGANIZATION> Forbes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> magazine </ORGANIZATION> estimates his fortune at $ 550 million. <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> owns one-third, with a fortune estimated at $ 270 million. <PERSON> Melvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> says he's always believed centers should be more than just a place to shop. Mall of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, he says, will be witness to that theory. Grand opening is scheduled for the fall of 1992. Built on the site of the old <LOCATION> Metropolitan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Stadium </LOCATION>, it will include four major anchors, 800 specialty stores, 18 theaters _ and Camp Snoopy. The latter will be a 300,000-square-foot theme family entertainment park created and operated by <PERSON> Knott </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Berry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farm </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Buena </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>. The park alone will cost $ 70 million. Phase I of the project will cost $ 600 million and will cover 78 acres. Included will be a golf course and parking space to accommodate 13,000 vehicles _ an area the size of 96 football fields. Plans call for developing as much as 9.5 million square feet of space at Mall of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, including hotels and office space. The <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> project is a joint venture with <ORGANIZATION> Triple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Five </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corporation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Edmonton </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Alberta </LOCATION>. Triple Five pioneered the `` mega-mall'' concept with its 5.2 million square-foot West Edmonton Mall. Another project coming on line for the <PERSON> Simons </PERSON> this year will be A & amp; S Plaza in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>, a $ 400 million renovation of the old <PERSON> Gimbel </PERSON>'s building. A glass wall on the Avenue of the <LOCATION> Americas </LOCATION> side will give pedestrians a view of dozens of stores on seven levels. To date, the company has developed 11 million square feet of shopping center space and manages 72.3 million, with 4,450 employees nationwide, including 1,004 in their <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION> headquarters. Currently, the company is adding about three major malls and eight to 10 smaller centers a year to its inventory. Today the company normally does n't get into a project without owning it _ either outright or in partnership, such as the case of Mall of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. `` We like to keep them and see them grow, so we become part of the community,'' <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> said. Community involvement is something the <PERSON> Simons </PERSON> are known for in <LOCATION> Indianpolis </LOCATION>. When the <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacers </ORGANIZATION> appeared ready to exit the city, the <PERSON> Simons </PERSON> shelled out $ 13 million for the pro basketball club, keeping them there. They saved a major downtown <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION> landmark by undertaking a $ 6 million renovation of the Roof Ballroom, where thousands of <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION> citizens had held proms and weddings. Their company will be spending $ 840 million on Circle Centre, an effort to remodel and revitalize much of downtown <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Melvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> also has tried his hand at the movies, producing films such as `` Zorro, the Gay Blade'' and `` Porky's.'' Other major <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> projects include: _ <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Promenade </LOCATION>, a planned hotel and shopping complex developed around <PERSON> Mann </PERSON>'s Chinese Theater; _ <ORGANIZATION> Newport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Centre </ORGANIZATION>, a 1.2 million square-foot project in <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION> that includes shopping and residental areas; _ Fashion Centre at <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION>, a 860,000 square-foot complex at <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION> that includes a 450-room hotel, shopping and office space. Abroad, meanwhile, the brothers are joining with a French consortium to build a 270-acre leisure, retail, convention and trade center known as <LOCATION> Europark </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Nice </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. Work is scheduled to begin next year. Figures released at the <ORGANIZATION> ICSC </ORGANIZATION> convention held in late May show were were 32,560 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> shopping centers in 1988, up from 30,600 the previous year. Those centers generated $ 627 billion in retail sales, up from $ 586 billion in 1987.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 In the past two decades the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has corrected many of the problems that had weakened its international competitiveness to the point that entire industries were lost to upstarts. Major manufacturers modernized factories, raised quality, reintroduced the work ethic, cut white-collar bureaucracies, learned how to export. Government regulators loosened up, and tax incentives were introduced. But, while <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> can take bows for having learned from history and taken action to correct its defects, it has a long way to go, beginning perhaps with the trade and budget deficits and the factors underlying them. While those items are in the news every day, and something is being done about them, several other problems of great importance lie dormant, ready to spring up like jacks in the box. There is, for instance, the massive question of guiding the economy. The Federal Reserve's faithful weapon against emerging inflation is to clamp down on the money supply, thus putting upward pressure on interest rates. It is an effective tool, but many critics see it as a bludgeon, not a scalpel. For example, one of the indicators of inflation used by the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> is capacity utilization by the nation's factories. When that percentage reaches 85, as it almost did earlier this year, inflation is said to be a real threat. Whatever capacity exists beyond that point is thought to be less efficient, Less efficient production is more costly production, and more costly production forces industry to raise its prices to buyers. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s approach has been to lessen demand on the factories by raising interest rates high enough to discourage buyers. Slack is created, and the least efficient facilities can be retired from use. Wait a minute, say the critics. Wo n't higher interest rates cut into the capital commitments necessary to increase capacity? Would n't it be wiser of the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> to see if it could create slack by encouraging growth in capacity? Big questions, but little is ever done about them. Some critical economists and business people have been arguing the position for decades, to no avail. Also without resolution _ probably to remain so until another crisis _ is the oil conflict. Are Americans willing to pay higher prices for oil? Ask the question anywhere and the answer is a unanimous `` no.'' But _ Americans also are becoming re-attracted to bigger cars. Relations with oil-producing nations, such as <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, are tenuous. And nobody gets more outraged at ecological damage than do Americans. The nation has no official position on this enormous economic threat, which can become a sudden reality because of military actions, oil spills, platform explosions or <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> decisions. Just as oil can break the economy, health care could also. When lives are involved it is difficult to apply cost restraints, especially in a profession where the ethic is to do everything possible to maintain or improve life. Attempts to impose business discipline on and by providers of health care, insurers and users have helped, but the problem remains. An aging population, rising health-care wages and scientific equipment contribute mightily. Because of these and other factors, health care remained in an inflationary mode throughout the 1980s, even while general inflation receded to under 5 percent. And there is little prospect for controlling that inflation. Housing for the poor belongs in the same category of problems. A variety of factors have driven up housing prices, important among them being a spurt in land costs, community restrictions and environmental concerns. These are among the costs passed on to buyers who can afford them. Housing for the poor, however, has never been profitable without government assistance in one form or another. Tax benefits have been used effectively in the past, as have relaxation of zoning or other inhibitions to building. Those tax benefits, however, were greatly reduced in the tax reformation of 1986. No longer is it profitable, or as profitable, for investors to put their money into massive construction projects. Thus, while single-family home construction has remained strong, building of multifamily dwellings has plunged. If anything, the housing situation for the poor has deteriorated rather than improved.

<DATELINE>EAST HARTFORD, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Unlike beer guzzlers who dash off to the store for quick gratification, <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON>'s customers are willing to wait up to eight weeks to savor their favorite brew. <ORGANIZATION> Snyder </ORGANIZATION> owns Brew and Wine Hobby in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION>, where beer aficionados can buy everything from the hops, malts and barley to the siphons, containers and bottles needed to brew their own beer. `` It spoils you forever and commercial beers never taste the same again,'' <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON> said. His store, where 25 brands of malt share space with beer mixes from around the world, is one of perhaps 1,200 across the country catering to the growing number of Americans who prefer their own brew to commercial lagers, ales and stouts, according to the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Homebrewers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boulder </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION> `` There is some work involved, but the satisfaction you get in the end is worth it,'' said <PERSON> Everett </PERSON> <PERSON> Stone </PERSON>, a computer analyst and <ORGANIZATION> Snyder </ORGANIZATION> customer, who has been brewing his own since 1982. `` You can give it your own personal touch.'' Home-brewing has only been legal in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> since 1979. A survey commissioned by Boots of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, a British drugstore chain, found there were about 1.4 million home-brewers in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as of 1984, the last figures available. Home-brewers produce an average 4.5 gallons or two cases of beer a month and spend about $ 250 a year on supplies, statistics compiled by the <ORGANIZATION> Homebrewers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> show. <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON>, who admits that he actually prefers homemade wine to beer, got into the home-brewing business by accident. He had lost his job as an English professor and happened to be in the store buying some wine-making equipment for his own hobby when the owner offered him a job as manager in 1972. The next year, he bought out the owner, a <ORGANIZATION> Pratt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Whitney </PERSON> engineer who operated the store as a lucrative hobby. <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON> added home-brewing supplies after it became legal. The brewing process, from initial boiling to final bottling and aging, takes six to eight weeks. It begins with the mixing of malt and boiling water for between 15 minutes for light beer or an hour for the heavier, darker stouts. Next comes a five-to-seven day fermentation process, when yeast is added to convert sugar to alcohol and carbon dioxide. Alcohol content depends on how long it ferments. The home-brew is then siphoned from the primary container to a secondary one where it remains until bottling. Prior to bottling, the home-brew is primed, when sugar is added to help produce carbonation. After bottling, the home-brew must age two to four weeks before it is ready to drink. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradford </PERSON>, marketing director for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Homebrewers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said home-brewing has become painless with the introduction of canned ingredients imported from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> that allow home-brewers to duplicate their favorite import, such as a John Bull lager or a Tom Caxton Scottish ale. `` Supplies are readily available and directions have been debugged so thoroughly they are foolproof,'' <PERSON> Bradford </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bradford </PERSON> says increased interest in home-brewing also stems from renewed emphasis on homemade products. `` People are interested in cocooning _ doing things at home _ and you can see that in the increased interest in gardening,'' <PERSON> Bradford </PERSON> said. `` The increased interest in gardening is somewhat analogous to home-brewing.'' Some home-brewers say they were drawn to their hobby as much by their wallets as their palates. A can of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bull </PERSON> lager mix can produce five gallons of beer or about two-and-a-half cases for as little as a $ 1.10 a six-pack. Imported beers retail for between $ 1 and $ 2 a bottle. `` My motivation was that English beer is difficult to come by -LRB- in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> -RRB- and it is expensive,'' said <PERSON> Mick </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cogdon </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Enfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, a 39-year-old sales representatives. `` With home-brewing you can keep the alcohol down, which lowers calories and means you can drink more.'' <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON> said many customers choose home-brew over such homemade products as wine because it is quicker and easier to make. It is also a year-round hobby, while the wine-making season runs from September to November. `` First of all we're a beer-drinking society and we want instant gratification or at least in the not too distant future,'' <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON> said. `` Wine is very seasonal and takes more skill to make and requires a longer aging process.''

<HEAD>NTT's Profits Drop in Face of Competition</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSAN MOFFAT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Japanese telecommunications giant <ORGANIZATION> Nippon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said Friday its earnings fell last year as it faced the fiercest competition it has seen since becoming a private business. <ORGANIZATION> NTT </ORGANIZATION>, which began its conversion from a government monoply to private ownership four years ago, posted a 5.2 percent decline in net income and a 14.3 percent drop in unconsolidated pretax profits for the fiscal year ended March 31. Company officials attributed the drop in profits to lower long-distance revenue caused by competition from new entrants in the market, and to a slump in revenue from data communications services. It said its net income fell to 230.6 billion yen, or $ 1.8 billion, while pretax profits dropped to 425.9 billion yen, or $ 3.28 billion, from 496.7 billion yen the previous year. Total operating revenue fell 0.2 percent to 5.65 trillion yen, or $ 43.48 billion, the company said. `` Fiscal 1989 was really the initial year of real competition in the market. For the first three years after privatization ... we continued to enjoy monopoly status because our competitors had not yet started to offer services,'' said <PERSON> Osamu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kajima </PERSON>, deputy manager of the accounting department, at a news conference. As <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s largest company, <ORGANIZATION> NTT </ORGANIZATION> has attracted international attention in the course of its transformation from government monopoly to semi-private company over the past four years. The company was a stock market star in 1987, when the first portion of its stock was offered to the public. In April 1987, two months after the stock was offered, a single share of the company was worth 3.18 million yen, the equivalent of about $ 24,100. Twenty-five percent of shares have been offered on the market, with the government still holding the remainder. But recently the company has fallen on hard times. Its hard-driving chairman, <PERSON> Hisashi </PERSON> <PERSON> Shinto </PERSON>, resigned last December after being implicated in the Recruit scandal, and was arrested in March on bribery charges. Competition also has forced <ORGANIZATION> NTT </ORGANIZATION> to lower its long distance rates, cutting into profits. <ORGANIZATION> Kajima </ORGANIZATION> said rate cuts cost <ORGANIZATION> NTT </ORGANIZATION> 110 billion yen in long distance charges last year. Its local telephone services still run large deficits, and it no longer can rely on its formerly overpriced long-distance services to make up the difference. <ORGANIZATION> NTT </ORGANIZATION> stock closed at 1.51 million yen Friday, below the 1.6 million yen price it was offered at when the company was first listed.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 When the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bond market rallies, you can usually thank West Germans, Japanese, Britons and other foreigners. At the end of 1988, foreigners held an estimated $ 634 billion in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> debt, or about 5.6 percent of the $ 11.3 trillion in outstanding credit market debt. Last year alone, foreigners pumped about $ 106 billion into the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> credit market, according to <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> statistics. So when the bond market rallied recently on the newfound strength of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar overseas, foreign investment was a major reason. A host of negative economic and political news in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> also played a role. The reason? When things are n't going well abroad and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic signs are being viewed in a positive light, dollar-denominated securities become a good investment for foreigners. `` They've turned on the buy signal,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Brusca </PERSON>, chief economist for <ORGANIZATION> Nikko </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` There has been buying of both stocks and bonds,'' he said. `` -LRB- Foreigners -RRB- have to buy dollars to do that, and they've been doing that.'' When the dollar soared last week to a 29-month high against the West German mark and a 19-month high against the Japanese yen, foreign investors scrambled to buy <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bonds. The stock bribery scandal in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> that has led to Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s resignation and domestic political pressures on West German Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> also have weakened confidence in those countries. And with central banks in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> pondering whether to raise interest rates in an attempt to stave off the rising dollar but still taking no action, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bonds remained attractive. The Bank of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> boosted its base lending rate a full point to 14 percent in the middle of last week, fueling speculation that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> would follow suit, and bond prices backed off a bit. When interest rates rise, bond prices fall. `` The stronger dollar is a confidence builder for the foreign investor, but if the dollar rises at too rapid a rate it raises doubts about durability,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lonski </PERSON>, senior economist at <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. A shaky economic climate in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> could spur a tightening of monetary policy. In <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, the outlook on inflation has been bleak with high oil prices and a weak mark. In <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, import prices have increased rapidly and the yen has sunk, but government officials there have said no change in monetary policy is yet warranted. The initial impact of an interest rate hike by the <ORGANIZATION> Bundesbank </ORGANIZATION> or <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> would reduce the need of the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> to ease monetary policy and bring down the value of the dollar, which could reduce the foreign binge on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bonds. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> raised interest rates this spring to curb inflation and economic growth. But with most <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic indicators pointing to a slowdown, another increase has been viewed as unlikely for now. `` Foreign bondholders will find that because of policy changes in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> directed at curbing domestic consumption and increasing exports, the dollar will be worth more in terms of foreign securities,'' <PERSON> Lonski </PERSON> said. Because of huge <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficits, foreign holdings of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> debt have increased at average annual rate of 18.9 percent since the early-1980s, <PERSON> Lonski </PERSON> said. As long as the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> imports more than it exports, foreigners can be expected to continue to loan billions to the country in the form of debt securities.

 Stock prices gained ground today, encouraged by new declines in interest rates. Trading was fairly quiet on the eve of a long holiday weekend. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 3.30 to 2,485.89 by 2 p.m. on Wall Street. Gainers outnumbered losers by about 7 to 4 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed issues, with 869 up, 481 down and 562 unchanged.

Activity was expected to taper off through the day as many traders got an early start on the long Memorial Day weekend. The markets will be closed on Monday. Interest rates fell in the credit markets today. Prices of long-term government bonds rose more than $ 5 for each $ 1,000 in face value, reducing their yields to the 8.6 percent-8 .65 percent range Analysts said stocks benefited from expectations that the recent downturn in rates might go further soon, with encouragement from the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>. The economy has showed signs of slowing lately, as <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> policymakers have intended.

 Stock prices rose today, encouraged by new declines in interest rates. Trading was fairly quiet on the eve of a long holiday weekend. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 3.11 to 2,485.70 by 3 p.m. on Wall Street. Gainers outnumbered losers by more than 9 to 5 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed issues, with 919 up, 487 down and 528 unchanged. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 123.09 million shares with an hour to go. Activity tapered off through the day as many traders got an early start on the long Memorial Day weekend. The markets will be closed on Monday. Interest rates fell in the credit markets today. Prices of long-term government bonds rose more than $ 5 for each $ 1,000 in face value, reducing their yields to the 8.6 percent-8 .65 percent range Analysts said stocks benefited from expectations that the recent downturn in rates might go further soon, with encouragement from the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>. The economy has showed signs of slowing lately, as <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> policymakers have intended. Furthermore, some observers think the central bank might want to ease credit in order to slow the recent sharp rise of the dollar in foreign exchange. <ORGANIZATION> Sea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Containers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> jumped 9 -RCB- to 57 -RCB-. The European companies <ORGANIZATION> Tiphook </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Stena </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AB </ORGANIZATION> made a $ 50-a-share offer for <ORGANIZATION> Sea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Containers </ORGANIZATION>, and traders quickly bid up the price in anticipation of a possible higher offer. <ORGANIZATION> Avon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> rose 1 ~ to 37 An official of <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said he and a group of investors remain interested in acquiring Avon, which recently warded off a hostile takeover bid by <ORGANIZATION> Amway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Rorer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, which said it was amenable to a merger if the right partner could be found, climbed 3 -LRB- to 41 <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> fell 2 -LCB- to 21.

 The price of <ORGANIZATION> Avon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> stock bobbed up again Friday after word of <ORGANIZATION> Mary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kay </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s interest in the cosmetics company resurfaced. Speculators bought Avon stock on the possibility that <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> or another suitor might engage in a relentless pursuit of <LOCATION> Avon </LOCATION>, which last week rejected a $ 2.1 billion takeover bid from <ORGANIZATION> Amway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Avon shares gained $ 1.87 -LCB- a share, rising to $ 37 by midafternoon as 1.42 million shares changed hands on the floor of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> Buyers were motivated by release of a letter sent to <ORGANIZATION> Avon </ORGANIZATION> Chairman and Chief Executive Officer <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Preston </PERSON> in which <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rochon </PERSON>, vice chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Mary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kay </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, expressed interest in acquiring <LOCATION> Avon </LOCATION>. The letter, made public Thursday night, contained no details of the financial aspects of a possible bid, which had been mentioned in previous news accounts but never publicly confirmed by Dallas-based <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Kay </PERSON>. <PERSON> Rochon </PERSON> stated the letter was being released so its sales force would have information about the matter. Avon spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Cox </PERSON> said the company would have no comment on <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Kay </PERSON>'s interest until after it was discussed at a regularly scheduled board meeting June 1. Wall Street securities analysts were uncertain whether <PERSON> Avon </PERSON> would feel more inclined toward accepting a bid from <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> than it did toward <ORGANIZATION> Amway </ORGANIZATION>'s advances. In turning down <ORGANIZATION> Amway </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 39-a-share offer, <PERSON> Avon </PERSON> blasted its direct selling rival as a totally unsuitable match and criticized <ORGANIZATION> Amway </ORGANIZATION> on moral and ethical grounds. One of the principle complaints <PERSON> Avon </PERSON> had was the difference in style between the two direct sellers, which <PERSON> Avon </PERSON> contended would result in a culture clash that could ruin business. In a letter informing <ORGANIZATION> Amway </ORGANIZATION> that its board had rejected <ORGANIZATION> Amway </ORGANIZATION>'s proposal, <PERSON> Avon </PERSON> characterized its own 1.4 million sales representatives as `` friendly'' and `` caring'' with a `` gracious manner. By contrast, <PERSON> Avon </PERSON> accused Amway of fostering zealotry and high-pressures selling tactics. <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Kay </PERSON>, meanwhile, was apparently anxious to dispel any misgivings <PERSON> Avon </PERSON> might have about the compatability of the two companies. The letter from <PERSON> Rochon </PERSON> said that if the two companies united, <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> and <PERSON> Avon </PERSON> each would maintain separate sales forces and identities. `` I do believe _ as you do _ that each company's sales force has developed a ` culture' of its own _ cultures which best remain distinct,'' <PERSON> Rochon </PERSON> stated. He added, however, that the two cultures share the same underlying values and therefore the management approach `` which has proved valuable in motivating <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Kay </PERSON>'s sales force to produce substantial growth will be transferable to Avon.'' <PERSON> Rochon </PERSON> said an investor group he heads called <ORGANIZATION> Argonaut </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION>, which includes <ORGANIZATION> Mary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kay </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cosmetics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the main holding of privately-held <ORGANIZATION> Mary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kay </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, has been working with <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> as a financial adviser. A spokeswoman for <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> said she was n't at liberty to disclose the partners. One takeover stock specialist said the link with <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION>, a major merger and acquisition investment house, might indicate the <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Kay-led </PERSON> investor group intends to wage a dogged attempt to get control of <LOCATION> Avon </LOCATION>. However, this investor, who spoke on condition that his name not be used, said Wall Street was reluctant to push Avon shares much higher because there is a perception <PERSON> Avon </PERSON>'s management is determined to keep the company independent. Earlier this week, Avon shares got a lift from a published report that investor <PERSON> Irwin </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> and an unidentified major company planned to launch a joint bid for Avon at $ 40 a share. <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Today </ORGANIZATION> reported <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> and the unidentified company were in the process of completing financing and other details of the hostile offer. <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON>' partner was said to be a company other than <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Kay </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON> owns 10.3 percent of <PERSON> Avon </PERSON>'s common stock through a partnership with <ORGANIZATION> Amway </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Amway </ORGANIZATION>, an Ada, Mich.-based direct selling firm, withdrew its offer after <PERSON> Avon </PERSON>'s rejection.

 <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> reacted angrily and leveled countercharges against the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on Friday after being named along with <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> as serious fair-trade violators possibly subject to stiff retaliatory tariffs. The Brazilian government also denied allegations of unfair trade practices and a top presidential aide in <LOCATION> Brasilia </LOCATION> said the nation would present `` solid arguments in its defense.'' The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration on Thursday listed countries with trade barriers most harmful to American producers, as required by the 1988 Omnibus Trade Act. The government has 18 months to negotiate away the barriers and failure of the talks could lead to tariffs of up to 100 percent on selected exports from the offenders. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Sousuke </PERSON> <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> summoned <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Armacost </PERSON> to deliver a protest in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> and the government said there were errors in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> complaints about alleged barriers to sales of supercomputers, satellites and forest products in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. Uno and other Cabinet ministers said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> action was `` extremely regrettable'' and officials indicated <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> would refuse to participate in talks sought by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to end the alleged practices. `` This designation in no way possesses legal binding force in the international trade system,'' said <PERSON> Hiroshi </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitsuzuka </PERSON>, minister of international trade and industry. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> was cited for barriers against foreign investment and the closing of its insurance market to foreign companies. The administration cited <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> for quotas on imports and licensing restrictions. `` We regard this law and action under it as totally unjustified, irrational and unfair,'' <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s Commerce Minister <PERSON> Dinesh </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>. `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>' action is particularly surprising because the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Itself has built and retained a variety of barriers against access to its markets,'' <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> said. `` It is hardly in a position to ask others to lift barriers without doing so itself.'' In <LOCATION> Brasilia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Ronaldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Costa </PERSON> <PERSON> Couto </PERSON>, the chief of staff of President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON>, said in a radio interview that <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON> was `` concerned'' about the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> decision but said, `` <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> has solid arguments in its defense.'' All three nations have trade surpluses with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, led by <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s $ 52 billion surplus. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> had a $ 700 million surplus with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1988, while the most recent figures available from <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> indicate that nation's <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exports totaled $ 8.54 billion last year and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> imports in the first 11 months of 1988 totaled $ 2.74 billion. Last year, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exports to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> rose 33.7 percent to $ 37.7 billion and the bilateral trade deficit shrank by $ 4.4 billion, according to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> statistics. But Japanese exports surged this year, increasing political pressure for <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to take action under the trade law. <PERSON> Mitsuzuka </PERSON> described <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade policy as `` to threaten other countries into negotiating by brandishing the threat of unilateral sanctions.'' He said the policy was contrary to the principles of the multinational General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, or <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION>, and could undermine the existing multilateral free trade system and ongoing Uruguay Round of <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Taizo </PERSON> <PERSON> Watanabe </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> would agree to `` quiet talks'' that might coincide with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> demands under the 1988 trade law. He also said <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> might complain to <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> if the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> imposed sanctions. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> has taken steps to open its markets, <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> said, denying that the specific <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> complaints `` can be considered to constitute trade barriers.'' `` I strongly regret the lack of fairness because the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has unilaterally made such a decision ... despite the fact that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> itself maintains import-restrictive measures and practices to a considerable degree,'' Uno said. <PERSON> Takuma </PERSON> <PERSON> Yamamoto </PERSON>, president of supercomputer maker <ORGANIZATION> Fujitsu </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, said the computer market in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> `` has been totally freed'' and the government policy on buying supercomputers _ contrary to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> complaint _ is not to discriminate between foreign and domestic producers. He said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> supercomputers have 15 percent of the Japanese market while Japanese supercomputers have only 2 percent of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market. No Japanese supercomputer ever has been bought by a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> public organization, <PERSON> Yamamoto </PERSON> said. The government also said sales of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forestry products in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> had doubled from 1986 to 1988, and the minister of posts and telecommunications, <PERSON> Seiichi </PERSON> <PERSON> Kataoka </PERSON>, noted <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> was buying five American satellites this year. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> last year exported about $ 3.2 billion worth of goods to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, it's biggest trading partner, primarily clothing, diamonds, crude oil and cashews. <PERSON> Anwarul </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoda </PERSON>, joint secretary in the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, said <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s trade surplus with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> only started in 1983 and had dropped sharply from $ 1 billion in 1987 to $ 700 million in 1988.

<HEAD>More Vacationers Driving, Taking Shorter Trips</HEAD>

 Vacationers are expected to drive more this summer than last despite the recent jump in gasoline prices but will take shorter trips, according to travel industry groups. Motor vehicles will account for nearly 83 percent of all summer travel, with 273 million vacationers expected to travel the nation's roads and highways in the 14-week period between Memorial Day and Labor Day, a 4 percent increase over 1988. `` The sharp increases in gasoline prices since March 1989, although higher than usual for the pre-summer travel season, are not expected to be a serious deterrent to auto vacation travel this summer,'' the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, D.C.-based <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Travel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> says. The center's data are based on a national telephone survey of 1,500 households. Retail gasoline prices have risen an average of 17.4 cents a gallon since Easter weekend, the steepest rise between holidays since Christmas 1979 and Easter 1980, when prices jumped 19 cents a gallon, according to the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Automobile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. The average retail cost of a gallon of gasoline is $ 1.254, with actual costs varying between cities, states and regions and self-serve or full-service stations. Air travel is expected to remain relatively stable at last summer's level representing about 15 percent of all vacation travel, while bus and train travel, which represents 1 percent, is expected to be at capacity. Airline fares increased far more than motor fuel in the first quarter of 1989 _ 6.2 percent versus 2.5 percent _ but second-quarter motor fuel prices have leaped more than 16 percent, due to a combination of factors, including the <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> oil spill and the strong rise in crude oil prices since January, according to <ORGANIZATION> AAA </ORGANIZATION>. Overall summer vacation travel is expected to rise about 3 percent from last year, with vacationers generally opting for shorter trips, industry surveys indicate. More than half of all summer travelers will make round trips of 500 miles or less, according to <ORGANIZATION> AAA </ORGANIZATION>. Average domestic miles traveled are projected to decline to 920 from 970 last summer. `` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> wants to travel more than ever and its people are going to satisfy this desire even if the demands of time and two-income families are forcing them to take three - and four-day trips in place of one - and two-week vacations,'' said <PERSON> Suzanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Cook </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> AAA </ORGANIZATION> data According to the center's survey, the volume of day trips and trips of up to three nights will rise 7 percent and comprise more than half of all summer vacation travel. Overall travel prices were up 4.5 percent during the first quarter of this year compared with last year, according to the data center. Transportation and lodging costs were up 4.1 percent, food and beverage costs up 4.6 percent and entertainment up 5.6 percent.

<HEAD>University Aims to Make Theory-Based Curriculum More Practical</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Students at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Graduate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> might be at a disadvantage when they land jobs because of the school's theory-based curriculum, according to a report released Friday. The internal study recommends changing teaching methods to focus on practical applications. `` You try to develop the disciplines underlying business management, but then you have to follow through and show how they are applied,'' <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> French </PERSON>, professor of finance and chairman of a 12-member advisory committee, said. The panel surveyed the student body and conducted interviews with recruiters, alumni and focus groups of students and faculty members. The group received responses from more than 1,350 of its full - and part-time students Students `` feel that their education would be improved if the faculty put more emphasis on the business applications of concepts, theories and empirical evidence we teach,'' the report said. While the analytical approach emphasizes well-defined problems with well-defined answers, students are confronted by ambiguous problems with no `` right'' answers in the workplace. `` Thus, they may not be as well prepared to deal with some of the demands of their initial job as graduates from other business schools,'' it said. The study was prompted by a <ORGANIZATION> BusinessWeek </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> magazine </ORGANIZATION> survey published last fall that ranked <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s business school No. 11 in the nation. Northwestern University's J.L. <ORGANIZATION> Kellogg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Graduate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> was ranked first. `` We did n't do as well as we would have liked,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gould </PERSON>, dean of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s business school. `` It's not where we have been traditionally. It is not the quality of this faculty,'' which includes a number of Nobel Prize-wnning economists and presidential advisors. `` I think we're closer to second or third or first,'' <PERSON> Gould </PERSON> said. The report recommended more interaction outside of class between faculty and students. It also suggested appointing coordinators to improve weaker courses. In addition, the report recommended cutting the number of full-time MBA candidates by 10 percent. `` Part of our problem is overcrowding,'' French said. `` And size also works against a sense of community.'' Currently the school has 1,123 full-time MBA students, up from 521 in 1970. There also are more than 1,000 part-time students pursuing MBAs. Tuition for full-time MBA candidates will be $ 15,500 next year, or $ 1,550 a course, based on a 10-course school year. Part-time students pay the same per course fee.

 The dollar continued sliding off the highs it reached earlier this week but finished mixed in a choppy domestic session Friday after falling overseas. The dollar was the center of a tug-of-war between central banks from around the world, which joined forces to push it lower, and traders who viewed a lower dollar as a buying opportunity. Thin volume ahead of the long Memorial Day weekend heightened the dollar's volatility. Most traders spent the day squaring their positions to protect themselves in the event interest rates rose overseas when <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> markets are closed Monday. `` Nobody wants to be exposed too much in the dollar over the weekend,'' said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Barbanel </PERSON>, a senior vice president at <ORGANIZATION> Gruntal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, one dealer complained `` the market had no depth,'' and said many players there finished trading at midday. British markets also will be closed for a holiday Monday. The dollar opened lower in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trading on rumors that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> was about to hike its discount rate by 0.75 percent and was further pressured by talk of a West German rate hike. Traders had expected the dollar to retreat from the highs posted earlier this week. The currency smashed the 2-mark level for the first time in two and a half years on Monday and finished <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> trading at 2.0115 marks two days later, when it also surged to close at 143 Japanese yen. But the central banks took notice of the gains. `` For the first time in a long time we've seen coordinated central bank intervention by even the smaller countries,'' <PERSON> Barbanel </PERSON> said. Also, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials earlier this week spoke out against the dollar's climb in an effort to stem further increases. But when the central banks sold dollars at Friday's lows in an attempt to depress the currency further, traders viewed it as a buying opportunity, said <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Flanagan </PERSON>, a vice president at <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hanover </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. While the intervention may have been effective over the course of the week, <PERSON> Flanagan </PERSON> said it failed Friday. `` The dollar just held at major support points,'' he said. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, the dollar closed at 140.40 yen, down from Thursday's close of 142.35 yen Later in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the dollar was quoted at 140.30 yen. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> the dollar fell to 141.10 yen from 141.23 yen late Thursday.

 <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> said Friday it had fired <ORGANIZATION> Ogilvy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mather </ORGANIZATION> as the advertising agency for its <ORGANIZATION> Maxwell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> coffee brand, which <PERSON> Ogilvy </PERSON> has touted for 31 years as being `` Good to the last drop.'' The food company said that following a review of several months it was awarding the account valued at more than $ 50 million to <ORGANIZATION> D'Arcy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Masius </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Benton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Bowles </PERSON>, another New York-based ad agency. The switch comes after <ORGANIZATION> Maxwell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> lost its longstanding position as the biggest selling domestic coffee brand to <ORGANIZATION> Procter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Gamble </ORGANIZATION>'s Folgers. `` This was a tough call that in the final analysis was based strongly on strategy and creative recommendations,'' <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Viault </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Maxwell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement from company headquarters at <LOCATION> White </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION>, N.Y. The account loss comes as a blow to <ORGANIZATION> Ogilvy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Mather, the largest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> unit of the <ORGANIZATION> Ogilvy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Ogilvy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> management recently accepted an $ 864 million buyout offer from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> WPP </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, another advertising giant. However, both <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ogilvy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Mather </PERSON> said the pending takeover had nothing to do with the <ORGANIZATION> Maxwell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> account switch. They said the agency review started months before the <ORGANIZATION> WPP </ORGANIZATION> deal was negotiated. `` It's a tough blow,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Ogilvy </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Roman </PERSON>. `` We thought we did a very good job, but they thought the other agency did a better job.'' Roman declined to speculate whether the account loss would lead to layoffs at the agency, which has handled <ORGANIZATION> Maxwell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> since 1958. <ORGANIZATION> Ogilvy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Mather </PERSON> has other major assignments from General Foods, including Post cereals and <PERSON> Tang </PERSON> and Country Time beverages and several assignments for coffee and other products overseas. The account win is the second major victory for <PERSON> D'Arcy </PERSON> in two weeks. Miami-based <ORGANIZATION> Burger </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> King </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> tapped <PERSON> D'Arcy </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Saatchi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Saatchi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advertising </ORGANIZATION> to split its $ 200 million-plus account on May 18. <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilhite </PERSON>, president of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> division of <PERSON> D'Arcy </PERSON>, congratulated the agency's employees in a memo for what was `` arguably the two biggest back-to-back new assignments in industry history.'' <PERSON> D'Arcy </PERSON> has worked with <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION> since 1929 and creates adverrtsiing for its Cool Whip topping and Good Seasons salad dressing. The <ORGANIZATION> Maxwell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> brand has been losing ground in the shrinking <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> coffee market in recent years. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McMillin </PERSON>, food industry analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> Maxwell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> lost its long-standing ranking as the biggest selling brand in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> coffee market to Folgers. He said <ORGANIZATION> Maxwell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>'s share of the $ 3.9 billion market fell to 25 percent in 1988 from just over 27 percent of a $ 4.1 billion market in 1987, while Folgers' share rose to 27.9 percent from 27 percent. <PERSON> McMillin </PERSON> said the new managers at <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION>, which has become part of the <ORGANIZATION> Kraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cos. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, are intent on reestablishing <ORGANIZATION> Maxwell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> as the best-selling coffee brand `` A new ad agency may give the brand a little bit of life,'' he said. While <PERSON> Ogilvy </PERSON> has used the `` Good to the last drop'' slogan in its <ORGANIZATION> Maxwell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> advertising, <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION> credits <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON> for coining the phrase decades earlier. The company said <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON> used the phrase to describe coffee at the <ORGANIZATION> Maxwell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> hotel in <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION> where it is believed the brand was born. Among <PERSON> Ogilvy </PERSON>'s more recent ads for <ORGANIZATION> Maxwell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> have been commercials featuring commentator <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellerbee </PERSON> and weatherman <PERSON> Willard </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> touting results of recent taste tests that compared <ORGANIZATION> Maxwell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and Folgers. <PERSON> Ogilvy </PERSON> got some encouraging news Friday despite the <ORGANIZATION> Maxwell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> account loss. <ORGANIZATION> Cotton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a New York-based concern representing cotton growers that had considered moving its account in the wake of the <ORGANIZATION> WPP </ORGANIZATION> deal, said it had decided to keep its $ 10 million assignment at <LOCATION> Ogilvy </LOCATION>.

 Renewed declines in interest rates provided the fuel for a broad pre-holiday rally in the stock market Friday. Activity tapered off through the session as many traders got an early start on the long Memorial Day weekend. The markets will be closed on Monday. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 11.18 to 2,493.77, cutting its loss for the week to 7.33 points. Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 5 to 2 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed stocks, with 1,019 up, 409 down and 532 unchanged. Volume on the floor of the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 143.12 million shares, down from 154.47 million in the previous session. Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market, totaled 169.86 million shares. Interest rates fell in the credit markets. Prices of long-term government bonds rose more than $ 5 for each $ 1,000 in face value, reducing their yields to the 8.6 percent-8 .65 percent range Analysts said stocks benefited from expectations that the recent downturn in rates might have further to go, with encouragement from the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>. The economy has showed signs of slowing lately, as <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> policymakers have intended. Furthermore, some observers think the central bank might want to ease credit in order to slow the recent sharp rise of the dollar in foreign exchange. <ORGANIZATION> Sea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Containers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> jumped 9 | to 57 The European companies <ORGANIZATION> Tiphook </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Stena </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AB </ORGANIZATION> made a $ 50-a-share offer for <ORGANIZATION> Sea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Containers </ORGANIZATION>, and traders quickly bid up the price in anticipation of a possible higher offer. <ORGANIZATION> Avon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> rose 1 | to 36 -RCB- An official of <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said he and a group of investors remain interested in acquiring Avon, which recently warded off a hostile takeover bid by <ORGANIZATION> Amway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Rorer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, which said it was amenable to a merger if the right partner could be found, climbed 3 -RRB- to 41 <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> fell 2 -RRB- to 21 -LRB-. The company said it may post flat or lower earnings for the second quarter. <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> led the active list, down 1 -LRB- at 55 on turnover of about 5.5 million shares. Brokers said much of the activity represented maneuvering by traders in advance of a $ 4-a-share special dividend to be paid to holders of record June 5. As measured by <ORGANIZATION> Wilshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>' index of more than 5,000 actively traded stocks, the market increased $ 22.20 billion, or 0.71 percent, in value. The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>'s composite index of all its listed common stocks gained 1.26 to 179.31. <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's industrial index rose 2.69 to 369.19, and <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; P's 500-stock composite index was up 2.42 at 321.59. The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market climbed 2.32 to 445.21. At the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the market value index closed at 355.01, up 2.36.

 <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T and its unions reported progress Friday in a hectic day of negotiations, but remaining disputes over wages and particularly health benefits left in doubt whether a new contract could be settled before a Saturday night deadline. `` Things have started to heat up,'' said <PERSON> Francine </PERSON> <PERSON> Zucker </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>. `` I think we're going to get very close and we may reach a settlement but that can change quickly.'' Ms. <PERSON> Zucker </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> officials said both sides were exchanging offers and counter-offers in the fastest-paced day of negotiating since the talks opened in late March. `` It is true that we are making progress in some areas but clearly there are still some issues, significant issues, to be resolved,'' said <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T spokesman <PERSON> Herb </PERSON> <PERSON> Linnen </PERSON>. `` We remain optimistic that those hurdles can be overcome.'' <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T workers nationwide staged a five-minute work stoppage at 4:15 p.m. EDT Friday in a show of union solidarity. In the talks, <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T officials said, the company offered to limit its use of temporary workers, a key union job-security demand. Still, it would take a major breakthrough to resolve the pay and health benefits disputes, and both sides were preparing for a possible strike when the current contracts for about 160,000 workers expire at 11:59 p.m. EDT Saturday. Sources close to the talks said <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T, which earlier this week proposed having employees pay more at first for health care, proposed in an informal meeting among top officials from both sides to revise the offer. Neither side would discuss details. But a union official said, `` It was a reconfiguration of the existing offer and it is unacceptable.'' Both sides have characterized health benefits as the issue most likely to prevent settlement. The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, agreed with the public statements of progress but cautioned that the negotiations were at a volatile stage and could turn for the worse. In an arrangement likely to be repeated Saturday, formal negotiating committees met at a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> hotel while the two union presidents and <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T's top negotiator held periodic meetings on the major issues. Whether the unions _ the <ORGANIZATION> CWA </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brotherhood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electrical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> _ would immediately call a strike remained unclear. If a contract agreement appears at hand at the deadline, the unions likely would agree to negotiate for another day or two. Even if major barriers remain, union officials have said they might not immediately strike and instead might try other strategies, including a nationwide labor boycott of <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T's long-distance service. `` We wo n't make that call until Saturday,'' Ms. <PERSON> Zucker </PERSON> said. Both sides have throughout the talks expressed hope a settlement would be reached before the current contracts expire, but Friday marked the first time both sides reported significant progress. In addition to offering to regulate use of temporary workers, <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> T </ORGANIZATION> has amended and expanded its contract proposal to improve eye and dental care and its parental leave policy. Also, it has proposed for the first time allowing leave for workers to care for sick relatives. Those proposals are in addition to the formal offer the company made Monday, a package which provided varying base wage increases and lump sum payments depending on job classification and also a new profit-sharing plan for union workers. Also included was a proposal to make employees pay more up front for health care, although current caps on how much a worker might have to spend in a year would remain in effect. <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T also proposed a lifetime benefits cap of $ 1 million. The unions are seeking expanded medical benefits at no additional costs to workers and say they have proposed cost-cutting ideas that would meet <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T's concerns about its rising health care bill, which hit $ 1 billion last year.

<HEAD>Chicago Merc, Board of Trade Aim to Unify After-Hours Trading Systems</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRENDA C. COLEMAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> have agreed to try to unify their planned after-hours electronic trading systems, the two announced jointly on Friday. The announcement comes as a marked turnaround for the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>, which has been highly critical of the <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION>'s planned <ORGANIZATION> Globex </ORGANIZATION> system and last fall recommended that the federal government deny the <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION> permission to operate it. The CBOT at the time said the <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION>'s system would be difficult to operate and susceptible to abuse. The <ORGANIZATION> CBOT </ORGANIZATION> has been making plans for an after-hours electronic trading system of its own, called <LOCATION> Aurora </LOCATION>. However, `` multiple trading systems place economic and technological demands upon market users which increase the cost of doing business,'' the two trading organizations said Friday in their statement. `` The CBOT and the -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- are committed to offering their members and trading public the best markets at the lowest cost while preserving their unrivaled liquidity,'' the statement said. Successful discussions on unifying systems, along with approval by respective memberships of the exchanges, would result in a single trading and order delivery system, the statement said. A <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said the exchange had no further comment on the announcement. A call to <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> Melamed </PERSON>, chairman of the executive committee of the <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, was not immediately returned Friday. London-based <ORGANIZATION> Reuters </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, which disseminates financial news and market information and is providing the technical expertise for <ORGANIZATION> Globex </ORGANIZATION>, is `` absolutely delighted with the announcment,'' it said in a separate statement. `` We look forward to working closely with both exchanges as their discussions progress,'' said <PERSON> Andre </PERSON> <PERSON> Villeneuve </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Reuters </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> holding company for <ORGANIZATION> Reuters </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION>'s original plans called for <ORGANIZATION> Globex </ORGANIZATION> to be operating by summer. Its aim is to link investors in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> through an electronic system for trading futures and options contracts on currency futures, including the British pound, the West German mark, the Swiss franc, the Japanese yen and Eurodollar time deposits. The system would operate during hours when the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>'s trading floor in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> is closed. Similarly, the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Aurora </LOCATION> system, originally planned to begin operating in the fall, would be activated after the close of daytime trading hours on the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> exchange floor. The Aurora system will handle only trading on financial futures and futures options, said the <ORGANIZATION> CBOT </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, who asked not to be identified. Futures and options allow investors to speculate on the future performance of commodities and financial instruments.

<TEXT>
 Grain and soybean futures prices closed mostly lower Friday in sluggish trading on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>, as activity was muted by uncertainty over the weather and by the impending Memorial Day weekend. On other markets, energy futures were higher, precious metals were lower and livestock and meat prices were down. Soybean futures were mixed, with the July contract higher on reports of heavy trading in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> of soybean oil and soybean meal. `` There is some talk that a number of countries will be purchasing soybean oil and soybean meal, including the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Karlin </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. Wheat settled 2 -LCB- cents to 5 cents lower with the contract for delivery in July at $ 3.93 -LCB- a bushel; corn was -LCB- cent to 4 cents lower with July at $ 2.64 \ a bushel; oats were 2 -LCB- cents to 3 -LCB- cents lower with July at $ 1.70 a bushel; soybeans were 13 cents lower to 9 -LCB- cents higher with July at $ 7.11 a bushel Uncertainty over the weather put a damper on most of the market. <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> forecasts for next week call for average or above-average rain for major crop-producing states. Corn futures were boosted slightly by heavy rains Thursday in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>. The rain could further delay the planting of corn crops in those states. Wheat futures were lower, despite an upswing in exports and reports the Soviets were in the market for spring and red winter wheat. After the close of trading, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> announced the sale to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> of 200,000 metric tons of wheat under its export bonus program. Energy futures were higher in quiet trading on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Analysts say the market has settled into a narrow trading range as next month's meeting in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries approaches. <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> members are to decide on production quotas for the second half of the year and whether to change the benchmark price for its oil, now at $ 18 a barrel. West Texas Intermediate crude oil was 4 cents to 18 cents higher with July at $ 19.52 a barrel; heating oil was .15 cent to .87 cent higher with June at 49.20 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .23 cent lower to .33 cent higher with June at 66.39 cents a gallon. Gold and silver futures were lower in sluggish trading on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Prices rose modestly at the start of trading, but as the dollar renewed its rise, gold and silver futures began to fall as investor took profits from the previous two days' advances, said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Cardillo </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Josephthal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Gold was $ 1 to $ 1.40 lower with June at $ 365.90 a troy ounce; silver was 1.3 cents lower with July at $ 5.305 a troy ounce. Livestock and pork futures mostly were lower in light trading on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Cattle were lower on a non-existing cash market and expectations of lower prices next week, said <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Benson </PERSON>, an analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. Hog prices declined because of slackening demand and large numbers of pork bellies in cold storage. Live cattle were .20 cent to .48 cent lower with June at 68.77 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .25 cent to .50 cent lower with August at 77.22 a pound; hogs were .15 cent to 1.15 cents lower with June at 47.60 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .50 cent to 1.17 cents lower with July at 31.07 cents a pound.

<HEAD>Targeting Japan For Unfair Trade Could Hurt More than Help</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICK GLADSTONE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> may say he justifiably punished <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> by formally branding it an unfair trading partner, but critics say he actually may have lobbed an economic boomerang against the financially powerful Japanese. The result, they say, could smack the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> from behind with a drastic drop in Japanese investment in this country, which at its worst could force a sharp runup in interest rates and cost many jobs, two key ingredients for a recession. Even <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Boskin </PERSON>, the president's chief economic adviser, counseled against targeting <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Boskin </PERSON> has said publicly that <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> efforts to punish trading partners could incite acute worldwide economic problems. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> named <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, along with <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, for what he described as persistently unfair practices that deny foreign access to their markets in businesses that range from supercomputers to to satellites to insurance. He took the action this past week under a provision of the 1988 trade law that requires the White House to compile what amounts to a target list of countries with barriers to American exporters. The law requires the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to impose up to 100 percent tariffs on goods from those countries if negotiations to erase the barriers fail. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said his goal was to force the three countries to `` to work constructively with us to resolve these issues expeditiously.'' But the immediate reaction was to provoke outrage from the target countries. The most significant response came from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, which threatened to take the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to international trade court and hinted at other possible retaliation for what the Japanese called an `` extremely regrettable'' decision. Exactly how <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> would respond remained unclear by the end of the week. But by many measures the Japanese have amassed enormous influence in the American economy, so any countermeasures could have potential severity, opponents of trade sanctions argue. Japanese products accounted for 44 percent of the $ 119.8 billion <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit last year. Japanese purchases of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> real estate have helped buoy property values in such cities as <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. Many Japanese companies now assemble products in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> buys billions of dollars worth of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government bonds, crucial to financing the federal budget deficit. Abrupt tariff-related price hikes for imported Japanese computers, cars, televisions or videocassette recorders would create some pain in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. But if Japanese investors shed large holdings of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> securities, the consequences could be much more profound. In a worst-case scenario, for example, Japanese sales of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> stocks could douse Wall Street's market's widely touted revival. Without Japanese purchases of <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bonds, the government would be forced to raise interest rates to attract investors, driving up rates in the credit markets and making it harder for American consumers and businesses to borrow money. The ripple effect could range from mortgage defaults and business bankruptcies to a drop in consumer spending, forcing companies to cut production and lay off employees. A surge in idled workers could cause another round of loan defaults and decline in consumer spending and the cycle would start again. In other business and economic news this past week: _ More evidence emerged that the economy is slowing but may not skid into a recession The government revised its first-quarter economic growth estimate to 4.3 percent from 5.5 percent, while durable goods orders rose 2.9 percent in April and personal income rose 1.1 percent, suggesting underlying strength. _ The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar took investors on an adventurous ride, surging early in the week to some of the highest levels in two years for reasons that ranged sheer speculation to political turmoil abroad But by the end of the week new skepticism about the dollar emerged on speculation that key <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trading partners would raise interest rates to make their currencies more valuable. _ <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> triumphed in a bidding war for the <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> lucrative Northeast shuttle with a $ 365 million offer, but the fate of the rest of the airline remained uncertain after nearly three months of a crippling strike and bankruptcy-court maneuvering

 Bond prices advanced Friday, recovering from an early decline on the strength of the dollar and signs that inflation might be moderating. The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>'s key 30-year bond rose 11-16 point, or nearly $ 7 for every $ 1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from price, declined to 8.61 percent from 8.67 percent late Thursday. Trading was described as thin in advance of the Memorial Day holiday weekend, and the markets closed earlier than usual. Prices began the day on the down side after the government reported consumer spending shot up 1.1 percent in April, the biggest advance in nearly a year. The spending data fueled the market's fears of inflation, which erodes the value of fixed-income investments such as bonds. But bond prices later recovered as traders examined personal income figures released by the government, said <PERSON> Maury </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, chief economist with <ORGANIZATION> PaineWebber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said personal income rose a weak 0.4 percent last month compared with hikes of 0.8 percent in March and 1 percent in February. The April figure was lower than the market expectations of a 0.7 percent increase, <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> said. The better-than-expected report gave traders hope that the inflation rate might be slowing. The dollar was mixed against other currencies, but showed signs of defying central banks' attempts to drive it lower. Its resilience carried over to the bond market, analysts said. In the secondary market for <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> securities, prices of short-term government issues were up -LRB- point to 5-32 point, intermediate maturities gained 9-32 point to 11-32 point and long-term issues advanced -LCB- point, according to figures provided by <ORGANIZATION> Telerate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a financial information service. The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $ 10 in the price of a bond with a $ 1,000 face value. The <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Bond Index, which measures price movements on all outstanding <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> issues with maturities of a year or longer, rose 3.32 to 1,151.87. In corporate trading, industrial bonds rose. <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION>'s Investment Grade Corporate Bond Index, which measures total return on a portfolio of 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years or longer, picked up 0.11 to close at 313.69. In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively traded municipal bonds was unchanged. The average yield to maturity edged down to 7.45 percent from 7.46 percent late Thursday. Yields on three-month <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bills, meanwhile, declined to 9.02 percent as the discount fell 5 basis points to 8.52 percent. Yields on six-month bills slipped to 9.10 percent as the discount fell 9 basis points to 8.43 percent. Yields on one-year bills declined to 8.90 percent as the discount lost 6 basis points to 8.26 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield is the annualized return on an investment in a <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bill. The discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face value, paid at maturity. The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was quoted at 911-16 percent, down from 913-16 percent late Thursday.

 <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steelworkers </ORGANIZATION> said Friday they'd tentatively agreed on a 50-month contract that restores pay cuts and matches wage gains won by the union at <ORGANIZATION> Bethlehem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The National settlement is the second among four major producers that faced expiring contracts July 31. It was approved by local presidents on the union negotiating committee late Thursday, the same day union members ratified the <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION> contract. National had been expected to tailor its agreement to the <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION> settlement even though National's profits per ton of steel are the lowest among the major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> producers. `` This agreement looks both forward and backward,'' <PERSON> Buddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, the union's chief negotiator, and negotiating secretary <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Lester </PERSON> said in a statement. `` It recognizes that our members have not had a wage increase since 1982 and that they have made significant sacrifices to help the company return to profitability.'' The contract, effective June 1, covers 7,300 union members at the three plants operated by the nation's sixth-largest steelmaker, <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Portage </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Ecorse </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich </LOCATION>. It restores wage sacrifices made in 1986, raising average base wages by $ 1.81 per hour to $ 13.69 by the time it expires in July 1993, said union spokesman <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hubbard </PERSON>. By a margin of nearly 4-1, union members Thursday ratified a 50-month package with No. 2 <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION> that raises average base wages by $ 2.50 per hour to $ 13.72 by July 1993. National employees will get a $ 500 payment in recognition of past concessions and a $ 500 cash advance on profit-sharing for 1989. Pension and medical benefits also will be improved, and new training programs will be offered. `` From a practical standpoint, I do n't think they could have given less, because there has n't been a wage increase since 1982,'' said steel analyst <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradford </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Markets </ORGANIZATION>. `` This looks about in line with inflation. The only problem is the steel prices are n't going up along with inflation.''

 Oil futures prices finished mostly higher Friday in quiet trading in advance of the Memorial Day holiday weekend. On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the July contract for <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Intermediate, the benchmark grade of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude oil, ended at $ 19.52 a 42-gallon barrel, up 4 cents. Prices of crude contracts for delivery after July also rose. Among refined products traded on the exchange, wholesale home heating oil for delivery in June edged up 0.15 cent to 49.20 cents a gallon. Contracts for the other delivery months jumped more than 0.80 cent a gallon. The June contract for unleaded gasoline fell 0.22 cent to 66.39 cents a gallon. Most other months rose, however. Analysts said there were no fresh factors influencing prices, and most of the movements resulted from oil traders balancing their positions in advance of the holiday weekend. `` Not a whimper, not a whisper,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Beutel </PERSON>, assistant director of the energy group at <ORGANIZATION> Elders </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. Traders continue to speculate about the outcome of an <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> meeting scheduled for next month, <PERSON> Beutel </PERSON> said In recent days, buyers have been reluctant to accumulate significant holdings ahead of the meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION> that is set to begin in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, on June 5.

<HEAD>Apple To Launch Big Marketing Campaign For Macintosh</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CUPERTINO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 In an effort to win corporate customers, <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> next week plans to launch its largest marketing campaign since the introduction of the Macintosh computer five years ago. The campaign uses an animation of a flying car to show off the Mac's capabilities and try to woo corporate customers, especially those in marketing, sales and advertising. The cost of the promotion _ including television and print advertisements and interactive in-store displays _ will be about $ 50 million, according to a published report Thursday in the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chronicle </ORGANIZATION>. In a break from earlier Mac advertisements, the new campaign stresses specific ways to use the computer. The ads, created by BBDO-Los Angeles, show how the computer can produce or display drawings, slides, specifications and financial data. `` It's one thing to have a great idea, but it's no good unless you can sell it,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Yaffe </PERSON>, vice president and account supervisor at BBDO-Los Angeles. `` These ads show ways people use Apple desktop media to communicate and sell an idea.'' New to the campaign is the phrase `` Apple desktop media,'' which is intended to emphasize the many facets of the Mac. Apple, however, will retain the slogan used in previous campaigns, `` The Power to Be Your Best.'' Nearly all materials employed for the campaign, from ads to brochures, were created using the Macintosh. `` That's important because we want to sell the Mac to people who want to make brochures with the Mac,'' said an Apple spokeswoman. `` We want to position the Mac at this point as the idea machine to communicate with.'' The biggest ad push by <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION> _ before its current campaign _ began on Super Bowl Sunday 1984 with the landmark `` 1984'' ads that showed a nightmarish vision of author <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Orwell </PERSON>'s `` 1984,'' pitting a young woman against Big Brother and a room of drone-like workers. <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION>'s stock hit a 52-week high Thursday, up 50 cents at $ 48.50 in active over-the-counter trading.

<HEAD>Nintendo Sues Atari Over Soviet Video Game</HEAD>
<DATELINE>REDMOND, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Japanese video game maker <ORGANIZATION> Nintendo </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday sued <ORGANIZATION> Atari </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Games </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> over the rights to <PERSON> Tetris </PERSON>, the first Soviet video game available in the West. <ORGANIZATION> Nintendo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> Nintendo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, filed a countersuit in federal court in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> charging <ORGANIZATION> Atari </ORGANIZATION> and its subsidiary <ORGANIZATION> Tengen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Milpitas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, of infringing on the rights to the Soviet game. The court action seeks to enforce <ORGANIZATION> Nintendo </ORGANIZATION>'s rights and those of <ORGANIZATION> ELORG </ORGANIZATION>, a Soviet government agency that licensed <ORGANIZATION> Nintendo </ORGANIZATION> to distribute Tetris for home video use in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. In Tetris, players manipulate rapidly falling geometric shapes to form solid horizontal lines. The game has been compared in simplicity and difficulty to Rubik's cube. <PERSON> Atari </PERSON> <PERSON> Games </PERSON> is no longer related to <ORGANIZATION> Nintendo </ORGANIZATION>'s main <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> competitor, <ORGANIZATION> Atari </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. In a suit against <ORGANIZATION> Nintendo </ORGANIZATION> in April, <ORGANIZATION> Tengen </ORGANIZATION> claimed ownership of exclusive rights to sell <PERSON> Tetris </PERSON> and charged that <ORGANIZATION> Nintendo </ORGANIZATION> was trying to drive the company out of the market for Nintendo-compatible video games. <ORGANIZATION> Nintendo </ORGANIZATION> has an 80 percent share of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> home video game market. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Nintendo </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> in this <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> suburb, said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Vern </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> on Thursday denied a motion for a preliminary injunction against <ORGANIZATION> Atari </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Tengen </ORGANIZATION>. At the same time, <PERSON> White </PERSON> said, the judge denied <ORGANIZATION> Tengen </ORGANIZATION>'s motion to dismiss the suit and scheduled a June 15 hearing. In another decision Thursday, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> rejected motions by <ORGANIZATION> Atari </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Games </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Tengen </ORGANIZATION> to dismiss <ORGANIZATION> Nintendo </ORGANIZATION>'s claims of trademark infringement and patent infringement in earlier legal action. <ORGANIZATION> Tengen </ORGANIZATION> has introduced a Tetris cartridge for use on <ORGANIZATION> Nintendo </ORGANIZATION> systems, claiming rights from the Soviets through sublicenses covering personal computers. The Tengen version has sold 100,000 copies. <ORGANIZATION> Tengen </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Nintendo </ORGANIZATION> split late last year when <ORGANIZATION> Tengen </ORGANIZATION> filed an antitrust suit accusing <ORGANIZATION> Nintendo </ORGANIZATION> of monopolizing the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market for cartridges that run on the <ORGANIZATION> Nintendo </ORGANIZATION> home video game system.
