 Tropical Storm <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> moved southwest away from <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> on Friday after dumping heavy rain on the island. Tropical storm warnings for <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> were lifted by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hurricane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Coral </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gables </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla </LOCATION>. The storm, moving in a clockwise loop, could make a complete circle in the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> if it stays together long enough to meet with a big funnel trough located in the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, forecaster <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Case </PERSON> said. `` That could cause the storm to move to the northeast in a big circle,'' Case said. But, there is a 50-50 chance the storm will dissipate before then, he said. `` We do n't see any major dramatic effect on land areas,'' he said. The system surprised forecasters by achieving tropical storm strength Thursday when its winds hit 39 mph. Rainfall reports Thursday from <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> included more than 14 inches at <ORGANIZATION> Punta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> del </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Este </ORGANIZATION> on the Isle of Youth, more than seven inches in <LOCATION> Matanzas </LOCATION> and nearly five inches in <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION>. At 10:30 p.m. EST Friday, the center of the storm was located near latitude 17.8 north, longitude 85.2 west, or about 175 miles east of <LOCATION> Belize </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Karen </PERSON>'s highest sustained winds were near 40 mph. The hurricane season begins June 1 and ends Nov. 30. However, hurricanes have been recorded in every month but April.

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Bingaman </PERSON> called on Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> on Friday to order an investigation into the abduction and torture of a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> nun in <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> last month. Sister <PERSON> Diana </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortiz </PERSON> of Grants, <LOCATION> N.M. </LOCATION>, was abducted Nov. 2 from a retreat house in <LOCATION> Antigua </LOCATION>, about 30 miles from <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, and released a day later. In his letter to <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> dated Friday, <PERSON> Bingaman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.M. </LOCATION>, said Ms. <PERSON> Ortiz </PERSON> was `` subjected to a 24-hour interrogation that included both physical and sexual abuse.'' `` There are indications that a man with a North American accent who finally stepped in to stop the physical abuse may have been associated with the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Bingaman </PERSON>'s letter said. This possibility `` warrants an expeditious but thorough investigation,'' the letter said, without giving further details. A <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> duty officer said nobody would be available for comment until Saturday. In his letter, the senator also enclosed press reports indicating a man wearing a Guatemalan police uniform participated in the abduction. Sister <PERSON> Ortiz </PERSON> had been a school teacher in rural <LOCATION> Huehuetenango </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Province </LOCATION> prior to her abduction. Her order, the Ursuline Sisters, has indicated she will not return to <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>.

 <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> is distributing voter registration forms inside each copy of the new telephone book, and officials hope the process catches on in other states. `` In every election, fewer and fewer people vote in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' Secretary of State <PERSON> Elaine </PERSON> <PERSON> Baxter </PERSON> said Friday. `` We're making <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> the leader in convenient voter registration procedures.'' Telephone books currently being distributed by <ORGANIZATION> US </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION>, the Denver-based regional phone company, include voter registration forms at the bottom of one of the instruction pages. The form can be clipped and mailed in an envelope to the county auditor. State income tax booklets that will be sent out at the end of the year also will include voter registration forms, under legislation enacted this year. <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Mix </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> US </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> vice president, said <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> is the first state in which the forms will be included in telephone books. He predicted other states would follow suit. `` I hope that this becomes a model for the voter registration process,'' he said. <LOCATION> US </LOCATION> <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> distributes nearly 2.2 million telephone books in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, Mix said.

<HEAD>Utah Officials Say Japanese Fusion Work Spawning Patent Concerns</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SALT LAKE CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Japanese researchers have duplicated recent <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> `` cold'' fusion experiments and are reaching for the lead in the emerging technology, one of the scientists who touched off the furor complained Friday. A <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> panel recently refused to back a national nuclear fusion program based on discoveries by <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION> electrochemist <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Pons </PERSON> and a British colleague, <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fleischmann </PERSON>. Physicists contend the <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> research has been largely discredited because other experimenters have failed to fully duplicate <PERSON> Pons </PERSON>' and <PERSON> Fleischmann </PERSON>'s results. But <PERSON> Pons </PERSON> said Friday that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> are making major investments in nuclear fusion research and development that could wrest leadership in the field away from the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. In March, <PERSON> Pons </PERSON> and <PERSON> Fleischmann </PERSON> said they had achieved room temperature, or `` cold'' fusion, by immersing in deuterium-rich heavy water rods of palladium inside electrically charged platinum coils. The two said the reaction yield heat equivalent to 100 times the energy needed to produce the reaction. `` They've been duplicating our experiments since late March,'' <PERSON> Pons </PERSON> said. `` The Japanese and Indians are doing just what's obvious They're doing the research needed to find out if it's feasible or not, and they're finding it is. A bitter <PERSON> Pons </PERSON> said if the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> does lose its lead in nuclear fusion research, the blame should rest squarely on the shoulders of the <ORGANIZATION> DOE </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>. The board recently concluded there is no conclusive evidence that <PERSON> Pons </PERSON> and <PERSON> Fleischmann </PERSON> actually produced fusion. `` We've tried to tell the country that research money is the only way to cover these -LRB- developments -RRB- properly, and its pretty obvious that's not going to get done,'' <PERSON> Pons </PERSON> said. `` We certainly ca n't match the scope of the work that the Japanese ... are doing.'' Japanese physicists at <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Nagoya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> said in the November issue of the English-language Japanese Journal of Applied Physics that fusion had occurred spontaneously between two palladium electrodes in a flask filled with deuterium gas. The Japanese said the major difference between their work and that of <PERSON> Pons </PERSON> and <PERSON> Fleischmann </PERSON> was the use of deuterium gas instead of heavy water. However, <PERSON> Pons </PERSON> he and <PERSON> Fleischmann </PERSON> already have carried out the same experiment as the Japanese, and have applied for a patent on the procedure. Japanese researchers point out their own experiments yielded a high level of neutron emissions _ up to 20,000 times the normal background level. That is one possible indicator of a fusion reaction. Topping that, another group of researchers at <ORGANIZATION> Osaka </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> this week reported detecting neutron levels 2.5 million times normal levels in a cold-fusion experiment using platinum electrodes in heavy water. In addition to the Japanese and <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, fusion research also reportedly is under way in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>.

The protests coincided with the second day of a two-day memorial held by Jesuit-run <ORGANIZATION> Loyola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> for six Jesuit priests murdered recently in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. There was no violence by the 80 or so protesters.

The demonstration at the 13-story building's eight elevators began about 12:45 p.m., capping a day of prayer, song and protest joined by numerous Jesuit leaders, nuns and local high school and college students. Among them were students from <ORGANIZATION> Loyola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, where <PERSON> Berrigan </PERSON>, who began his social activism with his brother during the 1960s, is teaching sociology this semester. Protesters blocked access to elevators by sitting in the doorways, preventing doors from closing.

 Chinese students are dismayed at President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s veto of a bill to let them remain here after their visas expire, saying he seems to be exempting <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> from the human rights standards held for other Socialist countries But several students expressed faith in <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s promise that he would help those who fear returning to their homeland through other means. <PERSON> Pei </PERSON> <PERSON> Min </PERSON> <PERSON> Xin </PERSON>, a graduate student in government at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and a pro-democracy leader, said Friday that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> caved into pressure from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, calling the fierce Chinese government opposition to the bill a `` bluff.'' `` People like us have come to this country not only to study but to learn how democracy operates. We have found that this single case is rather discouraging,'' <PERSON> Pei </PERSON> said. `` When it comes down to a choice between human rights and geopolitical interests, the leading democracy did not hesitate to choose the latter.'' Said <ORGANIZATION> Brandeis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> student <PERSON> Shen </PERSON> <PERSON> Tong </PERSON>: `` The basic signal to me from the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> government is that the government still holds different standards about human rights in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and other countries.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Thursday vetoed the bill, which had been passed without opposition in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The president said it was unnecesssary in light of other administrative proposals. The bill affects about 40,000 Chinese students and scholars in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The Chinese government has attacked the bill and has threatened to cut off all foreign exchange programs with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> if it passes. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he was directing Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> to take steps to administratively extend visa benefits to Chinese students. In a statement, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the administrative steps will provide `` the same benefits'' and `` accomplish the laudable objectives of the Congress ... while preserving my ability to manage foreign relations.'' Chinese students are particularly concerned about a <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> requirement that they return to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> for two years before reapplying after their visas expire. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s directions to <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> include waivers of the two-year requirement. <PERSON> Wu'er </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaixi </PERSON>, a prominent Chinese student activist who escaped to this country after the Chinese crushed demonstrations in and around <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>, believed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would help students. `` Of course we hoped very much to have the bill pass, but we were also glad and thankful to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> that he did, in fact, try to help <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> students,'' <PERSON> Wu'er </PERSON> said through a translator. `` I hope <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will do what he promised.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> may have been playing a diplomatic game _ supporting the democracy movement in fact while ostensibly following the wishes of the Chinese government, said <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Maddox </PERSON>, associate director of <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Fairbank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> for East Asian research and a frequent vistor to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Maddox </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also may be assuming that the bill will be overridden by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, which would give `` a good plug to his Chinese friends'' while letting the bill take effect. <PERSON> Pei </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> students are reluctant to seek political asylum in this country because they eventually wish to return to their homeland. `` I am a patriot living abroad, waiting to go back to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>,'' he said. <PERSON> Pei </PERSON>, who has studied in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for five years, said he has learned his name is on a blacklist of pro-democracy students. If he returned home now, <PERSON> Pei </PERSON> said, `` I would face at least life in prison or execution right away.''

The seemingly arcane bond issue is in fact a serious obstacle to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s hopes of borrowing money in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` We've got a pile of obstacles that high,'' said <PERSON> Valery </PERSON> <PERSON> Sorokin </PERSON>, economic counselor at the Soviet embassy, holding his hand about two feet above a coffee table. <PERSON> Sorokin </PERSON> has compiled a 33-page summary of problems that slow trade between the two countries. Negotiators have worked for over a year on the issue of bonds that the Soviets repudiated when they took power after the overthrow of the czar. <PERSON> Sorokin </PERSON> said there has been little progress. The Soviets have made agreements with <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> to redeem such bonds held by citizens there for a few cents on the dollar. One Soviet official, speaking anonymously, estimated the bonds' face value as high as $ 300 million They were issued by railroads and other privately owned business under the czar. `` We get letters from Americans every once in a while, asking us what to do with them,'' <PERSON> Sorokin </PERSON> said in an interview. A few dealers have been willing to buy them for small sums. Collectors have admired the certificates for their elaborate engraving. They were not considered to have any other value, so some were destroyed because they were creased or discolored. The government that ruled <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION> just before the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> takeover in 1917 was allied with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> against <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> in World War I. It got $ 192.6 million worth of loans from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The Soviets repudiated those loans too and made their own peace with <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. President <PERSON> Woodrow </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> sent <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops to <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION> in a combined action with <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. The Soviet government under <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> and his successors diligently kept the memory of that brief conflict alive, though it has been forgotten by most Americans. `` We have our claims, too,'' <PERSON> Sorokin </PERSON> said. With accumulated interest, the wartime loan claim now amounts to almost $ 1 billion. As long as it is not settled, a law passed in 1934 bars the Soviets from floating commercial loans in this country. On Thursday, members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> asked <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to make a priority issue of waiving another obstacle to commerce between the superpowers, the Jackson-Vanik amendment. That law keeps tariffs high against Soviet exports because of Soviet restrictions on emigration, now considerably eased. Trade between the two nations faces other restrictions as well. One <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> law says no government agency can help the Soviets get loans of more than $ 300 million _ not a large sum in world finance. It makes an exception only for the <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corporation </ORGANIZATION>, which lends to purchasers of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> farm products. But because of the more far-reaching Jackson-Vanik amendment, the Soviets have never been able to use that exception for their huge purchases of American grain. A 1986 law bans gold imports from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> as a sanction against race segregation laws, and also includes the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in the ban. Those are the world's two biggest producers of gold. A spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> MTB </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which opens an exhibit of coins in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> next week, said it will show Soviet silver and palladium coins but no gold ones. `` They would n't let us bring in any samples,'' said <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Ullman </PERSON>, `` not even a collection of historic coins from the Hermitage Museum in <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION>.''

<HEAD>Salvadoran Officials Have Softer Words for Arrested American</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Two Salvadoran officials are questioning whether an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> woman who was arrested in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> after weapons and explosives were found in the back yard of the home she rented was willfully helping rebels. <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Valdivieso </PERSON>, the Salvadoran undersecretary of foreign affairs, suggested Friday at a news conference that <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Casolo </PERSON> may be `` a naive person who has been used by'' the leftist rebels and that `` unfortunately she was found in the house at the time.'' Col. <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Amando </PERSON> <PERSON> Aviles </PERSON>, a spokesman for the Salvadoran military, told the same news conference at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> that he knows <PERSON> Casolo </PERSON> and `` she is a very nice, honest person that I consider a good American.'' Sen. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON>, D-Conn., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hemisphere </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee of the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said he was heartened by the statements about <PERSON> Casolo </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> native `` I am encouraged by these statements, and I hope they reflect a change in attitude by the Salvadoran authorities that will result in the swift and favorable resolution of the case against <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON> <PERSON> Casolo </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON> said. Still, Salvadoran President <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> indicated in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> that `` a judicial process'' was called for. `` We feel that anybody that breaks the laws in this country, no matter what nationality they are, should be submitted to the judicial process,'' <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> said at a news conference. `` If there is enough proof, and apparently in this case there is, in order to start a judicial process, one will be started,'' he said. Of former Attorney General <PERSON> Ramsey </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, who was in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> to advise <PERSON> Casolo </PERSON>, <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> said: `` If he is involved in any way in the politics of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> then his permit -LRB- visa -RRB- will be revoked immediately.'' Casolo, 28, has maintained she is innocent of any military connection with the rebels. She works in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> as a representative of the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>, Texas-based <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seminars </ORGANIZATION>, providing tours for Americans who come to see and study the country. She was arrested a week ago after Salvadoran officials, acting on a tip from a captured rebel, dug up the back yard of the house she had been renting for the past three months and found dynamite and thousands of rounds of rifle ammunition. Friends suggested she was framed by the Salvadoran government, but the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration took a different view. White House press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said Monday, `` This is hardly a case of a someone having a few things flipped in their shopping bag on the way home.'' And the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> began reviewing the case to determine if she broke the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Neutrality Act. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> took a softer approach Wednesday, saying <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials were `` monitoring her case closely to assure she is well treated.''

 Despite the rapid political change in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the role Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is playing there, six former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> defense secretaries are still skeptical of the permanence of the shift. `` I think that we should recognize that although Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is immensely popular in <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and even in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> that his popularity, his position in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> itself has weakened dramatically,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Schlesinger </PERSON>, who served from 1973 to 1975 in the <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> administrations. <PERSON> Schlesinger </PERSON> said Friday at the Third Annual Report of the Secretaries of Defense that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is walking a fine line that could tumble him from power if his reforms become too politically and financially costly. `` The Soviet economy is in serious decline. There is a possibility of a recession within the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, and Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s position is precarious. He may or may not survive, and it probably is in our interest that he survive.'' The others participating in the forum, <PERSON> Caspar </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON>, <PERSON> Melvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Laird </PERSON>, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> McNamara </PERSON>, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> and <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Rumsfeld </PERSON>, agreed that the Soviet reform spirit might not last. The panel discussion was sponsored by the nonprofit <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> were in <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> to hold a weekend summit aboard <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet warships. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> praised <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> Friday as `` a dynamic new Soviet leader'' whose policies of openness and other reforms are advancing the cause of world peace. But <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON>, who served as <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s defense secretary from 1981 to 1987, warned, `` The Cold War is not over.'' <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> can transform soldiers into farmers _ and back again _ in a matter of days. They can just as easily change their party leaders, <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON> said. He cited the reversal of what appeared to be democratic reforms in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> when the army cleared Tiananmen Square of demonstrators. `` The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is quite capable of reversing these things, like firing into crowds,'' <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON> said. Still, the former defense secretaries agreed that the opening of the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall and relaxed travel in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact nations could lead to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troop reductions in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. And each said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should keep hands off any attempts at reunifying <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. `` We'll be bringing Americans home. And you'll be seeing that by the end of the year,'' predicted <PERSON> Laird </PERSON>, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>'s defense secretary from 1969 to 1973. <PERSON> Schlesinger </PERSON> said the changes sweeping <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> are staggering. `` The <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact threat is quite different. For that reason, we can spend somewhat less than we have on our readiness posture in <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. And I stress somewhat less,'' <PERSON> Schlesinger </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 Scientists who began examining the carcasses of 100 laboratory monkeys imported from the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> by a <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> firm say they have so far discovered three with the ebola virus, considered the deadliest virus to humans before AIDS was discovered. Health officials also say they are monitoring the 25 employees at the <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> research firm that had received the monkeys in October even though they believe the disease would have turned up in the employees by now if any had been infected. Officials said none of the employees have shown any symptoms. The monkeys had been shipped to <ORGANIZATION> Hazleton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Reston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, a subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> Corning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Glass </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> that uses primates for cosmetics and drug testing. This is the first time the virus has been found in a non-human and the first time it had been found in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The discovery of the first infected monkey was announced earlier this week. `` We do n't know where they got the virus,'' <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Dasey </PERSON>, a spokesman at the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Infectious </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diseases </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Detrick </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Frederick </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, said Friday. `` We're continuing to help <PERSON> Hazleton </PERSON> and public health officials determine how far it has spread through the monkey colony,'' he said. In mid-November, medical investigators helped <LOCATION> Hazleton </LOCATION> determine that some of the monkeys suffered from simian hemorrhagic fever and that one monkey had the ebola virus. All of the animals in the shipment were then destroyed, authorities said. Since then, 17 monkey carcasses have been sent to <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Detrick </LOCATION> for necropsies, similar to autopsies in humans. The first seven arrived Wednesday, and three, including the initial animal, had the virus. Ten more delivered Friday have not been examined, <PERSON> Dasey </PERSON> said. It was not immediately known when the remaining necropsies would be performed. The ebola virus causes a contagious disease that is transmitted through body fluids and secretions, though not through casual contact, according to Dr. <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Fishel-Hoch </PERSON> of the institute. It was first identified in <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION> in 1976, where over 500 people died. The virus kills 50 percent to 90 percent of those it infects. There is no vaccine. Health officials said Friday that <PERSON> Hazleton </PERSON> employees who had worked with the monkeys had worn surgical masks, gowns and gloves on the job. `` At this point, I do n't see where we have a health problem,'' said <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>. `` We probably would have seen something by now if someone was infected, but we're still taking every precaution we can.'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said the 25 workers will be examined daily for the next three weeks in cooperation with the <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 The White House budget office wants to trim about $ 9.5 billion from projected spending on health and social programs in fiscal 1991, according to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration budget documents. Most of that would come from shaving $ 8 billion from what otherwise would have been spent on the <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> program next fiscal year under current law, according to the documents obtained Friday. The <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> _ which includes <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION>, Medicaid, Social Security, the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> _ proposed a fiscal 1991 spending plan with $ 8.2 billion in savings. Of that total, <ORGANIZATION> HHS </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> proposed to trim $ 5.1 billion from projected 1991 spending on <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION>, which finances health care for the nation's 33 million elderly and disabled. The White House Office of Management and Budget, however, wants to trim $ 8.1 billion from projected growth in the program, through reductions in payments to doctors, hospital reimbursement rates and other payments to hospitals for capital improvements and medical education. An <ORGANIZATION> HHS </ORGANIZATION> source, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said the budgets of a number of programs, including <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION>, are the subject of `` serious discussions'' between White House budget and department officials. Medicare spending is expected to reach $ 114 billion this year. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Bromberg </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION>, which represents private hospitals, called the proposed cut `` ridiculous'' and said he doubted <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would go along. `` The economic impact of not having your income keep up with your uncontrollable cost increases means either reduced quality or reduced quantity _ either you cut services or the quality is going to suffer,'' he said. Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Archer </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Texas </LOCATION>, ranking Republican on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, is circulating a letter among his <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> colleagues saying the nation's rural, inner-city and teaching hospitals `` simply can not continue to absorb another year of significant budget cuts.'' This year, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> restored about half of the $ 5 billion that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had proposed to cut out of Medicare for the fiscal year that began Oct. 1. In the federal-state Medicaid program, which provides health care for the poor, <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> sought to expand eligibility to include pregnant women and infants up to 150 percent of the poverty level, up from the current 133 percent. The <ORGANIZATION> HHS </ORGANIZATION> source said the department is reassessing whether states should be required or just encouraged to expand eligibility. Governors have complained that expansions of the Medicaid program are straining their state budgets.

 The government dropped its sedition and racketeering case against three leading militants of the 1970s after three years and more than $ 2 million in trial costs. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Budd </PERSON> said Friday he will not retry the case. Prosecutors claimed the radicals conspired to overthrow the government by force through a series of bombings and bank robberies. `` Given the amount of effort already expended in the investigation and prosecution, and the effort that would be needed for a new trial, I have decided that the best course is not to seek a retrial,'' he said. The federal jury cleared the three of sedition charges with a partial verdict Monday, then deadlocked on whether alleged bombing exploits constituted racketeering. A mistrial on the racketeering charges was declared Wednesday. Defendants <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Levasseur </PERSON> and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> will not go free because they are serving 45-year sentences on convictions in a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> federal court on some of the bombings. But the third defendant, <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Levasseur </PERSON>, has been released from prison after serving 3 -LCB- years of a five-year federal term for harboring a fugitive, her husband <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON>. `` I am grateful for my new life,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Levasseur </PERSON> said. `` I think it was a very reasonable thing that the government is doing by not retrying this case and I want to thank the jury and the community that they come from here for having belief in my innocence.'' Defense attorneys were delighted. `` I'm speechless. After 2 -LCB- years or whatever it's been on this case, it's the right result and I'm a little bit overwhelmed that the government did the right thing in this case at this juncture,'' said attorney <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>. Estimates of the trial costs ranged from $ 2 million to $ 10 million, much of it for the crew of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> marshals brought in to maintain security. The case began in May 1986 with an indictment against eight people on charges of seditious conspiracy, racketeering and racketeering conspiracy. Each count carries a maximum term of 20 years and $ 20,000 in fines. During the course of the case, charges were dropped against two of the defendants who were already serving long prison terms. Two others pleaded guilty and charges were dropped against a fifth person after a judge suppressed evidence seized at her house. By the start of trial in January, only three defendants remained. Prosecutors claimed the three were members of an underground group which bombed courthouses and other facilities from 1976 to 1984 in a plot to overthrow the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government. They claimed the group robbed banks to finance their actions. But the defense hailed the jury's rejection of the seditious conspiracy charges as vindication of their argument that the indictment in effect was for `` thought crimes'' and should never have been lodged. The government has used the sedition statute only a few times since it was first invoked to punish Confederates during the Civil War, according to <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON>, a professor at <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>. It was used to keep protesters from hindering the draft during World War I and to prosecute Puerto Rican nationalists accused in an assassination attempt against then President <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Truman </PERSON>. Last April, nine white supremacists were acquitted of seditious conspiracy charges in <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Rocky Flats Halts Plutonium Production Indefinitely</HEAD>

<DATELINE>GOLDEN, Colo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The federal government halted operations at the Rocky Flats nuclear weapons plant to resolve safety questions including whether enough plutonium dust has accumulated in the pipes to cause an uncontrolled nuclear reaction. Energy Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> announced a major management shakeup at the plant and said it would not reopen until the government and the plant's new contractor _ <ORGANIZATION> EG </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> G </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> _ are satisfied safety concerns have been met. At a news conference at the plant, 16 miles north of <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> said plutonium operations had been scaled back 20 percent and would be shut down altogether in the coming days. <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> acknowledged that any long-term shutdown could seriously affect the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>' nuclear weapons capability. The plant is the only one of its kind in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> that makes plutonium triggers for nuclear weapons. Other plants in the nuclear weapons industry that have been at least partly shut down in the last two years include the <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Site </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, the plutonium processing plant at the Hanford Reservation in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, and the Feed Materials Production Center, a uranium plant in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. Rocky Flats has been plagued by safety accusations in recent years and is the target of a federal criminal probe that so far has not resulted in indictments. Earlier this fall, <ORGANIZATION> DOE </ORGANIZATION> terminated its management agreement with <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and signed a new accord with <ORGANIZATION> EG </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; G, which is scheduled to take over fully Jan. 1. After touring the plant, <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> said, `` Although no major hardware problems were identified by the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> team, conduct of operations, standards of performance, engineering support and management structure remain deficient.'' Among the safety concerns he cited was an October report issued by a team of independent investigators which found weapon-grade plutonium in a pipe that serves as an exhaust ventilation duct at one of the plant's main buildings. Initial reports indicated there was enough plutonium present _ about 12 pounds _ to cause `` criticality,'' or a nuclear reaction, but another study found there was less plutonium in the ducts than originally thought. Both reports said there was no evidence a reaction had occurred. <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> said the criticality issue does not pose a public safety threat. `` Nevertheless, because it is an important safety issue, I am asking EG & amp; G to independently review the report's findings and produce their own action plan,'' he said. Gov. <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Romer </PERSON>, who was present at <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON>' news conference, said the decision to shut down plutonium processing at <ORGANIZATION> Rocky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flats </ORGANIZATION> shows a new commitment by <PERSON> DOE </PERSON> to safety. He added: `` It's obvious that the proof is in the pudding, and it's my job as governor of <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> to make sure the citizens are safe.'' Rep. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Skaggs </PERSON>, D-Colo., who earlier called for a complete shutdown at Rocky Flats, said <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> `` seems to be taking a positive, if somewhat uncertain step, but in the right direction. <PERSON> Skaggs </PERSON> said it was unclear how the shutdown period at Rocky Flats would be evaluated and verified. <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> admitted that <PERSON> DOE </PERSON> made major mistakes at Rocky Flats. `` We did not bring our management into the modern world and we're going to do that now,'' he said. Part of the shutdown period will be dedicated to safety training, <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> said. He said it would be necessary to regain public trust. `` Of course we have a credibility problem. What we are trying to do now is regain it,'' he said.

<TEXT>
 A producer at <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Today'' show says his deletion of an unfavorable reference to <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in a report on defective aircraft engine bolts had nothing to do with <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION>'s ownership of the network. `` I definitely was n't more careful because <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION> was involved,'' executive producer <PERSON> Marty </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> in a story published today. The original report said that <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION>, a manufacturer of aircraft engines among other things, accepted defective bolts from a supplier and for eight years did not require that the supplier certify the product's quality. The report, broadcast Thursday on the network's morning show, mentioned other manufacturers, but only the part pertaining to <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION> was cut, the newspaper said. <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> said `` an expanded spot'' about the GE allegations will air on the show next week. <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> said he did not think the reporter, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> WMAQ-TV </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, had `` journalistically -LRB- covered -RRB- all his bases.'' The <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> station had prepared and originally aired the report. <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> called the omission `` one of those things.'' <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> said he had been asked by `` Today'' show producers whether he had contacted GE for comment on the report. The reporter said he had done so on several occasions. `` My view is that you make a mistake when you treat your employer differently than anybody else,'' <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Magers </PERSON>, an anchorman at <ORGANIZATION> WMAQ </ORGANIZATION>, was quoted as saying.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Vishwanath </PERSON> <PERSON> Pratap </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> was sworn in as prime minister Saturday to replace <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>, and the new leader said his first goal would be to bring dignity to <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, whose previous government was dogged by allegations of corruption. President <PERSON> Ramaswamy </PERSON> <PERSON> Venkataraman </PERSON>, who administered the oath of office at the presidential palace, has given <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> 30 days to prove his <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> coalition </ORGANIZATION> can muster a vote of confidence in the new <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>, now consigned to the role of opposition leader, smiled as he approached <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> after the 10-minute ceremony. He was one of the first to offer congratulations. On Friday, <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> also was elected parliamentary leader of the centrist <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> and of the coalition's largest party, the <ORGANIZATION> Janata </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dal </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>'s selection came after last-minute conferences, a fistfight, and allegations of skullduggery within the front, which is united by little more than antipathy to <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. It formed a cohesive opposition force to defeat <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> in national elections Nov. 22-26. `` My first task is to restore the dignity of the country,'' <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> said Friday. `` We should make an <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> of which every Indian will be proud.'' The 58-year-old former defense minister said foreign policy would remain largely unaltered and that the government would take the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> into confidence on `` national issues.'' The Janata Dal has 141 of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>'s 144 seats in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>'s new policy-making lower house. The other three seats went to smaller parties in the coalition. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s party has 192 seats, and its allies have another 17. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> has also been promised support by the <ORGANIZATION> Bharatiya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Janata </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which has 88 seats, and by a combination of left-wing groups, which won 51 constituencies. That would give the coalition and its tacit allies 283 seats _ enough to carry a vote of confidence in the government. Although the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> has more seats than the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, it would have had more trouble forming a coalition. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> became prime minister in 1984 after the assassination of his mother, Prime Minister <PERSON> Indira </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>. His aides predicted the new government will fall apart before its five-year term expires, clearing the way for new elections and the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s return to power. The party governed <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> for nearly all <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s 42 years of independence. The <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> said it would not stake a claim to form the government. Instead, it appeared prepared to wait to see if <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> could preserve a government with his ideologically diverse allies. Coalition members said Thursday that <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, a former defense minister, was the only candidate for prime minister. But <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>'s professed reluctance for the job spurred two other candidates, <PERSON> Chandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Shekhar </PERSON> and <PERSON> Devi </PERSON> <PERSON> Lal </PERSON>, to enter the fray A whirlwind of consultations began Friday as <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> and other leaders drove from house to house and office to office. A few hours before <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> was named prime minister, riot police quelled fistfights between supporters of <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> and <PERSON> Chandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Shekhar </PERSON> in the street outside <PERSON> Chandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Shekhar </PERSON>'s home. <PERSON> Ram </PERSON> <PERSON> Jethmalani </PERSON>, a senior member of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, was punched and kicked by supporters of <PERSON> Chandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Shekhar </PERSON> when he got out of his car to begin a hunger strike aimed at persuading <PERSON> Chandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Shekhar </PERSON> to step aside in favor of <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>. The 78-year-old <PERSON> Jethmalani </PERSON>, one of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s top criminal lawyers, fell to the ground as the two sides traded punches. <PERSON> Chandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Shekhar </PERSON> stalked out of the parliamtentary meeting after <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> was chosen party leader. <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> was in <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s Cabinet until 1987, when he resigned amid reports his investigations into government corruption were proving embarrassing to the prime minister. Shortly afterward, Swedish and Indian newspaper and radio reports disclosed the Swedish arms manufacturer <ORGANIZATION> AB </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bofors </ORGANIZATION> paid as much as $ 50 million in commissions and kickbacks to get a $ 1.4 billion contract to supply the Indian army with artillery guns. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> vigorously denied wrongdoing, and the charges have never been proved, but they raised serious questions about the <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s integrity and cost him popular support

<TEXT>
 Researchers start clinical trials next month on a new vitamin A cream that researchers believe will smooth the small wrinkles from aging, sun-damaged skin, without the irritating side effects of Retin A. Dr. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Nigra </PERSON>, chairman of dermatology at <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, said the cream, called <LOCATION> Pelretin </LOCATION>, has proven in animal tests to be able to restore wrinkled skin to a youthful look. Now, he said Friday, the cream will be tested for six months on 240 patients in three cities to see if it works on humans. The results should be known in about a year, but it may take up to four years before <PERSON> Pelretin </PERSON> is approved for prescription use, the researcher said. The clinical tests were organized after <PERSON> Pelretin </PERSON> was tested on rabbits and the rhino mouse, a rodent that is genetically disposed to develop wrinkles early in life. The results of the animal tests, said <PERSON> Nigra </PERSON>, were `` dramatic.'' <PERSON> Pelretin </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Nigra </PERSON>, is a `` first cousin'' to Retin A, a prescription cream that was developed to treat acne but which doctors discovered also is effective against skin wrinkling. `` Pelretin should offer an advantage over Retin A because the early studies suggest it has a similar therapeutic response but with less side effects,'' he said. `` This is really a second generation of cosmetic pharmaceutical.'' The side effects of Retin A include a reddening of the skin, scaling and flaking, along with a burning sensation, <PERSON> Nigra </PERSON> said. The doctor said <PERSON> Pelretin </PERSON> `` has been through all of the studies ... to make sure it is a safe product to be used in human testing.'' Both Retin A and <PERSON> Pelretin </PERSON> contain a Vitamin A compound that some researchers claim has been shown in tests to smooth aging, damaged skin. Other dermatologists, however, claim that the creams only give the appearance of smoothing the skin and that the effects are not real. <PERSON> Nigra </PERSON> said his research with Retin A demonstrates that the compound does remove some wrinkles, giving what he called `` excellent'' results for 28.5 percent of patients who use the cream and `` good'' for 47.6 percent. But he said about half of the patients who used the placebo also showed `` good'' results because `` we taught them how to take care of their skin.'' <PERSON> Nigra </PERSON> said laboratory tests have shown that vitamin A compounds do improve skin tone. He said biopsies of skin treated with Retin A show that it has a hormonal effect that causes skin tissue to thicken. This, in turn, causes some wrinkles to smooth out. Volunteers for the clinical tests are being accepted at the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, and at hospitals in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>. The study is to start Jan. 8. <PERSON> Nigra </PERSON> said the patients in the study must be white, between 40 and 70 years of age and have skin that has been moderately to severely damaged from a lifetime of exposure. Other races will be tested later, he said, although dark skins tend not to be easily damaged by the sun.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Nadia </PERSON> <PERSON> Comaneci </PERSON>, who vaulted gracefully into American hearts as a tiny gymnast performing airy gyrations in the 1976 Olympics, has leaped what remains of the Iron Curtain to come live in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. The 28-year-old <PERSON> Comaneci </PERSON>, who defected from <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> on Tuesday, flew here Friday on the <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> plane `` Liberty Bell'' from <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>. `` I'm very happy because I'm here in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and I wanted from long time to come here,'' she said in halting English at a news conference at <LOCATION> John </LOCATION> <LOCATION> F. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kennedy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. `` I wanted to have a free life.'' <PERSON> Comaneci </PERSON> contacted a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> embassy in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> on Friday morning and was quickly granted refugee status, said <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> deputy spokesman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON>. He added, `` We certainly welcome Ms. <PERSON> Comaneci </PERSON>.'' Asked how long she had thought about defecting, she replied, `` A long time. I had it in my mind for a few years.'' <PERSON> Comaneci </PERSON> has traveled abroad frequently since becoming the first gymnast ever to score a perfect 10 at the Olympics. She won 21 gold medals altogether in Olympic and other international meets during her career, which earned her a life of privilege in a country that has endured chronic shortages of consumer goods for most of this decade. Her defection Tuesday to <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> was a blow to the hard-line government of Romanian President <PERSON> Nicolae </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>, who had named the gymnast a `` Hero of Socialist Labor'' for her athletic accomplishments. <PERSON> Comaneci </PERSON> was held up as a role model for Romanian youth. When asked what political impact her defection will have on <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Comaneci </PERSON> replied: `` It's not my business.'' The refugee status means <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials believe <PERSON> Comaneci </PERSON> has a well-founded fear of persecution if she returns to <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>, where the government has rejected the reformist tide sweeping other East European countries. <PERSON> Comaneci </PERSON> was accompanied at the news conference by a man who appeared to be translating reporters' questions for her. She introduced <PERSON> Konstantin </PERSON> <PERSON> Panit </PERSON> by saying: `` This is my friend who helped me to come here. I want to thank him.'' Her former gymnastics coach, <PERSON> Bela </PERSON> <PERSON> Karolyi </PERSON>, left <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1981 and had encouraged <PERSON> Comaneci </PERSON> earlier this week to follow his example. `` I knew she was unsatisfied and unhappy about her personal situation,'' he said. `` I was very happy to know she chose freedom and decided to make this very difficult step.'' <PERSON> Karolyi </PERSON> said he suspects she will be bombarded by `` business propositions.'' <PERSON> Karolyi </PERSON> coached the then 14-year-old <PERSON> Comaneci </PERSON> during her perfect performances at the <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> games. Speaking from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> on Friday, <PERSON> Karolyi </PERSON> said he planned to return to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on Sunday to meet with <PERSON> Comaneci </PERSON>, possibly in <LOCATION> Indianopolis </LOCATION>, headquarters of the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Gymnastics Federation. <PERSON> Comaneci </PERSON> would be eligible to apply for permanent resident status in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in one year, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials who requested anonymity said. <PERSON> Comaneci </PERSON>, accompanied by six other Romanians, crossed the border into <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> on Tuesday and went into hiding. She reportedly told a border guard she was leaving her homeland `` for the sake of freedom.''

 The <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has concluded that amounts of a key component of nuclear warheads that had been listed as missing were n't stolen after all, so the agency is resuming commercial sale of the material.

 A malaria drug is being recalled by a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> company because some of the bottles instead contain an animal diuretic. The recall by <ORGANIZATION> Biocraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Elmwood </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, applies to Goldline brand 250 milligram chloroquine phosphate tablets packaged in 100-tablet bottles labeled as lot number 14311, the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> said Friday. The recall began after a pharmacist found a bottle containing the animal diuretic, a drug that steps up production of urine, the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> said. No injuries have been reported. Bottles containing the wrong drug have been found in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>. Using tablets from the erroneously labeled bottles would not protect against or treat malaria, which can be life-threatening, and large amounts of diuretics can lead to irregular heartbeat, low blood pressure and general weakness, the agency said.

 Striking telephone workers ratified a contract negotiated last week after a four-month walkout, and planned to return to work on Monday. `` It's over, it's over, it's over,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Master </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>. `` We're happy. Eighty-five percent of union workers approved the contract with <ORGANIZATION> Nynex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The ratification Friday marked the final settlement of strikes against regional telephone companies that began in August. The strikes at one point involved 200,000 workers in 20 states. The <ORGANIZATION> CWA </ORGANIZATION>'s 40,000 regional members struck <ORGANIZATION> Nynex </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION>.

We're looking forward to welcoming all our employees back to work on Monday, and dedicating ourselves to providing the quality service our customers rely on us for.'' The rancorous <ORGANIZATION> Nynex </ORGANIZATION> walkout left one striker dead after a picket line confrontation; the company reported hundreds of instances of sabotage against its equipment. The strike created long delays for people and companies seeking new telephone installations. The major point of contention concerned the company's insistence that workers share part of their health costs. But the final settlement did not include any health-cost sharing.

 Election officials in the Mexican state of <LOCATION> Tamaulipas </LOCATION> declared an opposition candidate the winner in the mayor's race in this border city, but his party claimed fraud in another contest. In <LOCATION> Reynosa </LOCATION>, another border city, the campaign manager of the Authentic Party of the Mexican Revolution accused the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Institutional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, or <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION>, of trying to steal the election by moving the vote count to the state capital, <LOCATION> Ciudad </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Victoria </LOCATION>. Candidate <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> was declared the winner in <LOCATION> Matamoros </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Davila </PERSON>, vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electoral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. Statewide mayoral elections were held Sunday, but the vote count for <LOCATION> Matamoros </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Reynosa </LOCATION> and other cities has been delayed by protests, accusations of fraud and other problems. <PERSON> Davila </PERSON> said the results of the <LOCATION> Reynosa </LOCATION> mayor's race were not complete Friday evening. <PERSON> Eliud </PERSON> <PERSON> Trevino </PERSON> <PERSON> Guerra </PERSON>, campaign manager for the opposition mayoral candidate in <LOCATION> Reynosa </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Ramon </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>, said the vote count for <LOCATION> Reynosa </LOCATION> had been suspiciously moved to <LOCATION> Ciudad </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Victoria </LOCATION> after all of the opposition parties signed off on election results showing <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> was the winner. <PERSON> Trevino </PERSON> claimed the <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION> planned to cook the results. <PERSON> Pedro </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION> campaign coordinator in <LOCATION> Reynosa </LOCATION>, said his party won the mayor's race in that city.

 The son of suspended Navajo Chairman <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> appeared before a tribal court after special prosecutors asked for an arrest warrant to force his return to the reservation. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> `` Rocky'' <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> pleaded innocent Friday in <ORGANIZATION> Navajo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to conspiracy charges stemming from the tribe's 1987 purchase of a northern <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> ranch. The younger <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> had failed to show up at two other arraignments, claiming that the <ORGANIZATION> Tribal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> had no jurisdiction over him because he no longer lives on the reservation and because the alleged crimes took place off-reservation. Defense attorney <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Benally </PERSON> told District Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Yazzie </PERSON> the younger <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON>'s failure to appear before was `` based on a misunderstanding.'' But special prosecutor <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Donatelli </PERSON> said the younger <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> agreed to the arraignment when he realized that the tribal judge was planning to issue a bench warrant for his arrest and to start extradition proceedings against him. `` I think he was just trying to see how far he could push the court,'' <PERSON> Donatelli </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Yazzie </PERSON> released the younger <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> on his own recognizance but ordered him to have weekly contact with his lawyer. The senior <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> has been on paid administrative leave since Feb. 17. On Wednesday, he pleaded innocent to 107 criminal charges alleging he received more than $ 500,000 in illegal contributions and kickbacks from 1986 to 1988. The elder <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> was charged by special prosecutors with conspiracy, bribery, fraud, extortion and election-law violations. The charges focus on the tribe's purchase of the Big Boquillas Ranch from non-Indian middlemen who made a $ 7.2 million profit on the property.

<HEAD>U.S. Supreme Court Drops Illinois Abortion Case Pending Formal Settlement</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SPRINGFIELD, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> granted a request from both sides in an <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> abortion dispute to defer arguments in the case, and a lower court was expected to approve an out-of-court settlement. If it does so, it would defuse tension from a case that had been viewed by legal experts as a likely opportunity for the high court to alter the 1973 <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> v. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> decision legalizing abortion. `` Because of this morning's action, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> is closer to having a set of regulations that guarantee the health and safety of women who choose to have an abortion,'' Illinois Attorney General <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartigan </PERSON> said in a statement Friday. The argument session in the case _ in which pro-choice advocates opposed the state's regulations governing abortion clinics _ had been scheduled for Tuesday, and many were awaiting the court's ruling with considerable anticipation The decision to defer arguments will keep the case on the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> docket, in limbo, until <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Nordburg </PERSON> acts on a settlement reached by the two sides, and they ask the justices to dismiss the case. The key issue in the <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> dispute is a set of strict regulations imposed on abortion clinics, where most early-pregnancy abortions are performed. Opponents of the regulations, including the <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> chapter of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, which successfully had challenged them in lower courts, said they could severely have restricted the availability of abortions. `` We're gratified by the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> action in facilitating a settlement of the lawsuit,'' said <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> attorney <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> Grossman </PERSON>. State Rep. <PERSON> Penny </PERSON> <PERSON> Pullen </PERSON>, a leading abortion opponent, said the court's move came as `` no big surprise.'' `` I am not so sure whether our interests would have been served having Mr. <PERSON> Hartigan </PERSON> argue the case in the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> anyway,'' she said. Initially, <PERSON> Hartigan </PERSON> had sought to have the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> uphold the state regulations and the high court accepted the case for review last July 3. That was the same day the justices announced, in a <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> case, a decision giving states greater authority to regulate abortions. But <PERSON> Hartigan </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> candidate for governor in 1990, later sought a settlement in which <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> women would be guaranteed continued access to abortions. The legal challenge to the abortion regulations was launched by Dr. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Ragsdale </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Rockford </LOCATION>. Four years ago, <PERSON> Ragsdale </PERSON> won a preliminary injunction against the regulations in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, contending that the state's elaborate building codes for abortion clinics were medically unnecessary.

<HEAD>President Says Pakistanis Frustrated After One Year of Democracy</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Ghulam </PERSON> <PERSON> Ishaq </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> told a joint session of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> today that one year after <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s return to democracy, high expectations have turned into despair He blamed most of poor public morale on the government of Prime Minister <PERSON> Benazir </PERSON> <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>. In a toughly worded address to <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Ishaq </PERSON> said `` A year of trading abuses and inaction is starting to frustrate budding hopes.'' <PERSON> Ishaq </PERSON>, 77, criticized Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>'s left-leaning government and its center-right political opposition for squandering opportunities to strengthen <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s fragile democracy, which followed 11 years of military rule. `` Instead of understanding and accommodation there has been confrontation at all levels and political horse trading,'' he said. `` A year ago there was a festive look. Faces were flushed with fresh resolve and new hope. But now, I'm honestly reflecting the feelings of millions of our people. They are in the grip of agony and concern,'' <PERSON> Ishaq </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Urdu </LOCATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Pakistan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> won the largest bloc of votes in November 1988 in the first free elections in more than a decade. But an alliance of opposition parties won control of powerful <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> province. <PERSON> Ishaq </PERSON> said bitter squabbling between the two has given rise to the admonishment that `` the country's legislators do everything but legislate.'' He warned that democracy in developing nations has to be more than an intellectual exercise. He said charges of corruption, which have plagued Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>'s government, and only incremental improvements in the quality of life, will weaken `` he common man's faith in democracy. In an interview after the president's speech, <PERSON> Amnar </PERSON> <PERSON> Piracha </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> lawmaker, said: `` We have to look at what went wrong ... and people may be upset, but people have not lost faith in the democratic process.'' She said <PERSON> Ishaq </PERSON>, who was closely aligned with his predecessor, military President Gen. <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> <PERSON> ul-Haq </PERSON>, `` has to rise above past affiliations and play a role in building -LRB- relations -RRB- between the federal and provincial governments.'' The majority of the <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> lawmakers are also <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> loyalists. <PERSON> Zia </PERSON>, who overthrew Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>'s father in a 1977 coup, died in an August 1988 plane crash which cleared the way for elections. <PERSON> Ishaq </PERSON> complained that Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>'s government has done little to carry on an Islamization program launched by <PERSON> Zia </PERSON>. Before his death, <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> was trying to introduce an Islamic legal system linking state and religion. <PERSON> Ishaq </PERSON> also warned against parliamentarians changing allegiance in mid-term, which is illegal under <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s constitution. Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> in November inducted three opposition members into her cabinet, which generated opposition cries that her government was ignoring the rules. The three, however, have maintained their original party affiliations. On the positive side, the president said Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>'s government has launched an economic renewal program that is making some progress, particularly in keeping the inflation rate under control. He said <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s return to democracy has improved its international standing and brought economic benefits.

<TEXT>
 Deadly pancreatic cancer again has struck the family of former President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, prompting a leading cancer researcher to suggest regular testing for the entire clan. <PERSON> Gloria </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> <PERSON> Spann </PERSON>, <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>'s sister, was released Friday from <ORGANIZATION> Emory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, where the 62-year-old Plains resident was diagnosed with the ailment, according to a statement from Dr. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> York </PERSON>. Mrs. <PERSON> Spann </PERSON> is the former president's last surviving sibling. His father, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> <PERSON> Sr. </PERSON>, his brother, <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, and sister <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> <PERSON> Stapleton </PERSON> each died of pancreatic cancer. While only about 6 percent of pancreatic cancer victims have a family history of the disease, those who do have it in the family are several times more likely to get it than the general population, said Dr. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON>, a professor at <ORGANIZATION> Creighton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Neb </LOCATION>. `` We recommend a CAT scan of the pancreas or an ultrasound for people who are at very high risk, such as <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON>, who recently completed a study of 18 families with 47 members having pancreatic cancer. <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON> said research has shown that the <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> family children could have a greater chance of developing pancreatic cancer, a disease that has its onset after the late 40s. Part of the need for early screening, he said, is that when the cancer produce symptoms, `` it may have been there growing more subtly for five or 10 years.'' <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>'s father died of pancreatic cancer in 1953. <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> died of the disease in September 1988 at age 51. Mrs. <PERSON> Stapleton </PERSON> was 54 when she succumbed to the disease in September 1983. <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>'s mother, `` Miss Lillian'' <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, had breast cancer that had spread to other organs, including her pancreas, when she died in October 1983 at age 85. Mrs. <PERSON> Spann </PERSON> said in a statement released Friday through the <ORGANIZATION> Carter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Presidential </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> that she was not feeling any symptoms from the disease, which was diagnosed during routine testing. She said she was `` feeling great,'' said center spokeswoman <PERSON> Casie </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>. `` In fact, she and her husband <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> are planning to ride their motorcycles to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> for the weekend.'' Researchers have found that pancreatic cancer is almost always fatal, <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON> said. `` In spite of advances in chemotherapy, radiation therapy and surgery, most patients with pancreatic cancer do not survive more than a year,'' he said.

 A <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> ad that ran in British publications pokes fun at <LOCATION> Boise </LOCATION> _ the destination of a <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> flight that crashed and killed 28 people two years ago. The ad pitches 2-for-1 tickets from <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> and other destinations. `` Admittedly, there are a few places in the States that we do n't fly to,'' says the ad, which ran about a month ago `` -LRB- But, be honest, how often do you really need to go to <LOCATION> Boise </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>? -RRB-'' Idahoans, including Gov. <PERSON> Cecil </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrus </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Boise </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Dirk </PERSON> <PERSON> Kempthorne </PERSON> and victims of the <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> crash on Friday blasted what they called the airline's insensitivity. Fourteen Idahoans died and 42 were injured in the Nov. 15, 1987, crash of Flight 1713. On Friday, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Donnell </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>'s senior vice president of marketing programs in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, apologized and said the ad was changed immediately after he saw it. `` I'm very sorry that it happened,'' said <PERSON> O'Donnell </PERSON>, who said the ad was crafted by a <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> agency unaware of the crash. `` It was anything but intentional; it was based on ignorance.'' <PERSON> Andrus </PERSON> slammed <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>. `` The ad is a cheap shot from a cheapskate,'' <PERSON> Andrus </PERSON> said. `` Unfortunately, the real insult is that in 1987 a lot of people tried to fly from <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Boise </LOCATION> on <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> and many of them died or were injured. The remark is grossly insensitive. But then again, what do you expect from <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>?'' <PERSON> O'Donnell </PERSON> said the ad ran this fall in The <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> Times, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, The Economist magazine and perhaps other publications. `` It could n't have run more than a handful of times,'' he said. <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> of <PERSON> Melba </PERSON> was on Flight 1713, and his wife <PERSON> Tami </PERSON>, was killed. `` It just confirms your feelings about how callously and poorly <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> is run.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s decision to provide air coverage to the <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> government during its latest insurrection could further complicate the issue of future American military presence in the islands, analysts say. Committing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> planes to help President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s government might make the six American military bases in the islands more of a terrorist target for some radical critics of the Philippine government, said one analyst, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, a conservative think tank But <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON> said the quick <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agreement to Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s request for help could also `` favorably influence'' her government in negotiations starting in about two weeks on a possible extension of the bases treaty, set to expire in 1991 Recognizing strong political opposition to continuing the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military presence, Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> has not yet declared whether she favors prolonging the base arrangement. Many <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials predict a new treaty eventually will be approved. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Melegrito </PERSON>, a prominent Filipino-American, said it would have been wrong not to accept <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> help against the rebels if <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> democracy were truly at stake, and `` the question now is what will be the price? It will add pressure on the government as it enters into negotiations, an added complication.'' The Washington-based <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Philippines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> issued a statement of concern that the use of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> air power `` in a coup situation may be used in upcoming base talks to signify continued Philippine dependence on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military presence.'' It quoted <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> analysts as saying `` reluctance of Philippine pilots to fire on their rebel colleagues'' was one reason <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> planes were needed for air coverage. <PERSON> Melegrito </PERSON> organized a demonstration of more than 50 people outside <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Philippine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> Friday that supported the Aquino government and at the same time urged it to deal more harshly than in the past with plotters who have attempted at least five previous coups. Along with `` Long Live Cory'' chants and slogans, there were speeches and placards demanding `` no amnesty for traitors ... lock them behind bars.'' <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> was in recess but bipartisan support for President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s decision to provide air support for the <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> government came from those reached for comment. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, called President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s decision to provide air support `` prudent and in our national interest.'' A country might be justified to use revolution and military insurrection to rid itself of dictatorship, <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said, but the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> is a democracy. `` If there are elements in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> who disagree with -LRB- <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s -RRB- policies, they have a means to change the government through election,'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said. `` President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> took the kind of measured action required'' in a situation where <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> democracy was `` hanging in the balance, and the safety of the civilian population was at stake,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Solarz </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Asia-Pacific </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee.

<HEAD>Priceless Artifacts to be Returned to Peru</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A treasure trove of artifacts looted from an ancient Peruvian gravesite is going home after months of legal wrangling following raids on <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> art collectors. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> agents delivered six crates carrying 123 pre-Colombian artifacts to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> for shipment Friday night, <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Fleming </PERSON> said. The artifacts include one piece believed to be 8,000 years old. <PERSON> Fleming </PERSON> said representatives of the Peruvian government told <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials the objects of ceramic, wood, stone, fiber and metal `` have an intrinsic value of $ 1 million, but their historical value is priceless.'' Peruvian President <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> was scheduled to be on hand to receive the stolen national treasures upon their arrival in <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>. The artifacts were stolen from <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Sipan </LOCATION> Tomb, an ancient burial site, more than two years ago, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, another Customs spokesman. `` They've compared the site in significance to King <PERSON> Tut </PERSON>'s -LRB- in <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> -RRB- because it's a site they were n't previously aware of and it included royalty,'' <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said. `` A lot of the site is intact and it will tell a lot more about how people lived and died.'' Some of the most valuable items, displayed at a news conference Friday, include gold ear spools and a ceramic sculpture of a man cutting his own throat. They were among 1,300 seized in March 1988 raids on eight dealers and collectors. One dealer was convicted of making a fraudulent customs declaration, sentenced to six months in prison and fined $ 10,000.

<HEAD>Asian Elephant Dies During Surgery After Caesarean Section</HEAD>
<NOTE>By DAVID SEDENO</NOTE>
<NOTE>Associated Press Writer</NOTE>
<DATELINE>SAN DIEGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An Asian elephant who earlier underwent an unprecedented Caesarean section died during emergency surgery at the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> Wild Animal Park. A team of veterinarians worked on <PERSON> Jean </PERSON>, the 19-year-old, 7,000-pound elephant, for about three hours Friday in hopes of alleviating complications caused by the death of the fetus in her womb. But in the end there was nothing they could do to save her, park spokesman <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanscom </PERSON> said. The elephant was destroyed with a fatal dose of anesthetic while still unconscious for the surgery, he said. <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> had been fighting a severe abdominal infection caused by the dead 300-pound fetus, which was removed Nov. 20 during the first Caesarean section known to have been performed on an elephant. After the infection started, veterinarians fed <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> intravenously and gave her antibiotics and pain killers, but her condition did not improve and veterinarians operated again Friday night in a last-ditch attempt to save the pachyderm's life. `` Veterinarians attempted to repair the uterus. They were unable to do so. They also attempted to do a hysterectomy but were unable to do that because of its size and inaccessibility,'' <ORGANIZATION> Hanscom </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> had made the record books after being pregnant for more than 730 days, surpassing the pregnancy of an Asian elephant that gave birth at a zoo in <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> after 720 days. The normal gestation period for the <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> elephant is between 618 and 648 days. `` If there is any positive sign to the ordeal, in our attempt to save her life we have gained a tremendous amount of knowledge that we can hopefully apply to the care of other elephants,'' <ORGANIZATION> Hanscom </ORGANIZATION> said.

<HEAD>Search for Lobstermen Ended After 11 Days</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> gave up its search for five missing lobstermen after nine days of searching amid snow and fog over thousands of miles of the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION>. The hunt for the <PERSON> Heidi </PERSON> <PERSON> Marie </PERSON> and its crew of five was officially suspended at 5 p.m. Friday. Hundreds of men and women and the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> and even <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> B-52s from <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> had taken part. Despite sightings of at least five flares that signaled life somewhere out in the vast cold sea, neither the boat nor its crew have been seen or heard from since Nov. 22. `` It's a very difficult conclusion to reach, but we've come to the point where our chances of success are about nil,'' said Rear Admiral <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Rybacki </PERSON>, commander of the <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, headquarters for the search for the 72-foot steel-hulled vessel out of <LOCATION> Stonington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>. Aircraft and cutters were deployed over more than 100,000 square miles in the search `` We feel awful,'' <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Aitkins </PERSON> said. `` It is frustrating. You do all you can. It's frustrating for us. We want to give everybody good news.'' The last sign of life came Thursday when a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> plane spotted an orange object the size of a life raft about 4 feet under water, 300 miles south of <LOCATION> Nantucket </LOCATION>. On Friday, high winds, snow, fog and roiling seas hindered efforts to get another glimpse of the object.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Stout </PERSON>, a veteran television newsman noted for his tough talk, dry wit and no-nonsense camera presence, died of a heart attack at age 62. Stout died Friday after being hospitalized Thursday at <ORGANIZATION> Cedars-Sinai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> for flu-like symptoms. He had delivered the last of his trenchant commentaries on Tuesday for his `` Perspective'' segment of Action News on <ORGANIZATION> KCBS-TV </ORGANIZATION>, the CBS-owned television station in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. He had been associated with the network for 36 years, and had written and reported his commentaries since 1978. A curmudgeonly journalist with an irascible yet witty style, Stout was one of the best known television newsmen in <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Stan </PERSON> <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> KTLA-TV </ORGANIZATION> said, `` He was really what I would call the conscience of television news. He was real dedicated. He could handle very complicated issues and express them with great clarity. You always wanted to know how <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> felt about an issue because he'd hit it right on the head. Stout was described as `` one of the few remaining real reporters in the city'' by <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> Police Chief <PERSON> Daryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Gates </PERSON> when he received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame in February 1988. When informed of the honor, <PERSON> Stout </PERSON> said, ` Oh God, I have to get out of this.'' At the ceremony, however, he was uncharacteristically touched: `` It's easy to be sophisticated and blase and say, ` Who cares?,' but I am overwhelmed.'' Stout was born in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and graduated from <ORGANIZATION> UCLA </ORGANIZATION> with a degree in English at the age of 19. His first reporting jobs were with the now-defunct <ORGANIZATION> Minneapolis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> and later with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. He came to <ORGANIZATION> KNXT </ORGANIZATION>, which later became KCBS-TV, in 1950, and spent the next seven years as a writer, researcher and reporter for the investigative series `` Special Assignment.'' In 1960 he went to <ORGANIZATION> KTLA-TV </ORGANIZATION> as an investigative reporter and news anchor. He joined <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> in 1963 and for nine years was its <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> correspondent. He returned to <ORGANIZATION> KCBS-TV </ORGANIZATION> in 1972. Stout's `` Perspective'' series on the station had been recognized over the years with many local Emmy awards, Golden Mike awards and honors from the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. Earlier this year he won the Freedom of Information Award from the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> chapter of the Society of Professional Journalists. Stout had anchored <ORGANIZATION> KCBS-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s special coverage of major events, such as elections and the visit of Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> II. He also had been a moderator of `` Newsmakers,'' a weekly KCBS-TV news interview series. He is survived by his wife, <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON>, and eight children. Funeral services were pending.

 The security chief of a <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> church that teaches nuclear war is inevitable was sentenced to three years probation for using false identification to buy weapons for 200 members. <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>, 42, a 15-year member of the <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Universal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Triumphant </ORGANIZATION>, also was fined $ 1,000 by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Justin </PERSON> <PERSON> Quackenbush </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> said the firearms were only intended to protect members from nuclear war. `` They were intended for myself and Mr. <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> -LRB- church vice president <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> -RRB- to be used only to protect our loved ones and community in the event of a holocaust that would destroy civilization as we now know it,'' <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> said.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, feeling `` pretty good'' despite rough seas, received an update early today on the coup attempt in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> before embarking on his first summit with Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. High seas and gale-force winds forced a change in the site of today's U.S.-Soviet talks to the Maxim Gorky, a Soviet cruise ship anchored off <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION>, and cancellation of the opening summit ceremonies. But the talks began as scheduled. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> took the admiral's barge from the USS <PERSON> Belknap </PERSON>, his summit residence, to the <PERSON> Maxim </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorky </PERSON>, where he was met by <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. The two leaders shook hands, and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, `` Let's go to work.'' He told reporters he was `` feeling pretty good'' and that he slept `` fine, just fine ... piece of cake.'' White House officials said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> awoke at 7 a.m. this morning and, at a breakfast meeting, was given a detailed report on the situation in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> by Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, White House chief of staff <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> and <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON>, the national security adviser. In <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>, renewed fighting was reported today as government warplanes and helicopters hit remaining rebel positions. Rebels were reported still holding an air base in the central <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, and hundreds were gathered outside armed forces headquarters in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> and in the city's financial district. But the Aquino government said the coup attempt had been defeated. Since arriving in <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> early Friday, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has divided his time between preparations for his meetings with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and updates on the attempt by rebel military officials to topple the government of <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, at the request of Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>, ordered <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> fighter jets Friday to provide air cover and help the government defend against the coup attempt. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was already over the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> on his way to <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> when Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> asked for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> air cover to halt rebel air attacks and keep the mutineers pinned down in two air bases they controlled. A few hours earlier, the rebels had bombed the presidential palace in the most serious effort to bring down Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> since she came to power in 1986. The president approved the request from aboard Air Force One at 12:30 p.m. <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> time -LRB- 11:30 p.m. EDT -RRB-, and the decision was relayed to Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> an hour later from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> by Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Roman </PERSON> <PERSON> Popadiuk </PERSON>, deputy press secretary. `` The process went well under very difficult circumstances,'' <PERSON> Popadiuk </PERSON> said, noting that the request came late at night while <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> were both in flight. In addition to the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> F-4 Phantom jets providing air cover, 100 Marines were sent from a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> base to protect the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Popadiuk </PERSON> said. `` There are no reports of any injuries to Americans, or any attacks on Americans,'' he said. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said no <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> planes had `` fired any shots or intercepted any rebel aircraft.'' Even limited <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military intervention could give <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> a rejoinder to complaints <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> planned to lodge about Soviet military involvement in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and elsewhere. <PERSON> Arkady </PERSON> <PERSON> Maslennikov </PERSON>, a spokesman for the Supreme Soviet, criticized <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s decision. `` Any interference in internal developments, especially by outside powers, is destructive and leads to deterioration of the situation,'' he said. `` In any event, the best thing is to allow the Filipinos themselves to sort it out.'' <PERSON> Popadiuk </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s motive was twofold: `` A democratic government has asked for assistance; we have American lives to protect.''

 Two Southern <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> freight trains collided today, knocked eight cars into a swamp and forced the evacuation of more than 50 people for fear hazardous materials were leaking. But authorities quickly determined there was no leak, and everyone was allowed to return home, said Capt. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Zinna </PERSON>, a sheriff's spokesman. There were no injuries. <PERSON> Zinna </PERSON> said it happened as one train with 106 cars en route from <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> on the main line passed a spur line. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> is about 15 miles to the east. He said the train on the spur line was waiting for the main track to clear but was slowly backing and hit the rear cars of the passing train. Eight tank cars carrying flammable, hazardous materials _ including liquefied petroleum gas _ were derailed from the main line and fell into the swamp along the tracks on their sides, <PERSON> Zinna </PERSON> said. Two empty flatcars on the rear of the spur line train were knocked off the tracks but did n't overturn, he said. People within one mile were temporarily evacuated. He estimated 50 to 75 people were evacuated from the area, which has a sparse population. The derailed tank cars will be unloaded into other tank cars before the job of righting them. `` That will probably take all weekend,'' <PERSON> Zinna </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 Communist leaders, paving the way for a new government, have developed a blueprint for reform that charts a course for the future and dramatically alters the official view of the past. <PERSON> Vasil </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohorita </PERSON>, a member of the ruling Politburo, unveiled an `` action program'' Friday for the party that meets some of the demands of opposition groups who have spurred historic change in the country. In <LOCATION> Bratislava </LOCATION>, an estimated 60,000 demonstrators Friday celebrated the sudden changes in <LOCATION> Czechoslvakia </LOCATION>. The crowd braved freezing temperatures for 2 -LCB- hours to cheer speakers invoking the need for unity in achieving democracy in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>. The Politburo plan announced by <PERSON> Mohorita </PERSON> changes the official <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> view that the <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> invasion that crushed the 1968 `` Prague Spring'' reforms was justified. `` We are of the opinion that the intervention of five countries in 1968 was not justified and the decision to do it was wrong,'' <PERSON> Mohorita </PERSON> said at a news conference. <PERSON> Mohorita </PERSON> said no decision had yet been made on another opposition demand to end direct Communist control of the workplace. The draft also pledges the Communists `` will not interfere with the media,'' <PERSON> Mohorita </PERSON> said. The proposed government plan outlines the `` new position'' of the party following a vote by <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> Wednesday scrapping constitutional provisions guaranteeing the party a monopoly on power, <PERSON> Mohorita </PERSON> said. The program has to be approved by the party's <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and be adopted by a party congress tentatively scheduled for Jan. 26. The <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> is scheduled to meet on Dec. 14, <PERSON> Mohorita </PERSON> said, and could vote to hold the congress sooner. The party daily Rude Pravo reported Friday that the Politburo had ordered the creation of a special commission to re-evaluate the 1968 reforms and `` the circumstances under which the armies of five Socialist countries entered <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>.'' The commission's report would augment the decision already taken by the Politburo, <PERSON> Mohorita </PERSON> said. The news came a day after more radical reversals of previous policy. <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> announced it would remove part of its border with <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> and lifted virtually all restrictions on travel to the West. The <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said Friday that work on dismantling the grim barbed wire, watchtowers and trip wire along sections of the border with <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> would likely not begin until the second half of December. Meanwhile, senior government official <PERSON> Frantisek </PERSON> <PERSON> Pitra </PERSON> renewed talks with dissident <PERSON> Vaclav </PERSON> <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> on forming a new government that will include non-Communists. The composition of the government is to be announced by Sunday. Party chief <PERSON> Karel </PERSON> <PERSON> Urbanek </PERSON> backed the decision to review the 1968 reforms, which were introduced by liberal party leader <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON>, who was ousted in disgrace after the invasion. <PERSON> Mohorita </PERSON>'s statement from the Politburo paved the way for a possible reassessment of the reforms and invasion by the <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> at meeting in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> next week following the <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> summit of President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> have said the invasion was wrong. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> have not, and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has said a re-evaluation by the <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> alliance </ORGANIZATION> could take place only if requested by <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, on Friday, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> did say the `` Prague Spring'' reform movement of 1968 was `` right at that time and is right now.'' But he stopped short of apologizing for the invasion. <PERSON> Mohorita </PERSON> said there would have to be a `` new attitude toward former leaders,'' but he did not say if that referred to <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON> or hard-liners who took charge after the liberal leadership was ousted. <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON> has been cheered as a hero by thousands of people at pro-democracy rallies. The hard-liners who ousted him were removed in a party shake-up last week following 11 days of demonstrations.

 The Maxim Gorky, site of the first summit talks between President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, is the Soviets' most luxurious cruise ship and the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> leader's floating hotel for the <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> meeting Today's summit talks were to have been held on the <PERSON> Slava </PERSON>, a Soviet guided missile cruiser rolling at anchor within sight of the slightly larger cruise ship, but rough weather prompted officials to shift to the Gorky, which was brought to <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> to house the Soviet entourage. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Raisa </PERSON>, spent Friday night aboard the 630-foot luxury passenger liner, which is tied up to a pier in the wind-swept <LOCATION> Marsaxlokk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>. The white-hulled ship, which boasts 12 decks, heated outdoor and indoor swimming pools and a sauna deck with medicinal baths, is distinguished by the yellow hammer and sickle painted on a red band around the single smokestack. The two presidents met in the Card Room on the Promenade Deck. The Gorky, named for the Soviets' most famous revolutionary writer, was built in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> 20 years ago and purchased by the <ORGANIZATION> Soviets </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipping </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in 1974. It has been used since to generate hard currency by carrying West Germans and other foreign tourists on <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> cruises. Westerners who have sailed aboard the ship say it offers very good service, uncharacteristic of Soviet tourist enterprises, and relatively inexpensive cruises. The luxury liner struck an iceflow in the Arctic off <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> last June, forcing evacuation of the 575 passengers and most of the 377 crew members. Norwegian vessels took the evacuees on board, and no one was reported injured. The ship underwent extensive repairs and refurbishing after the accident and is reported to have been modernized and fitted with even more luxurious compartments than it had before. <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION>, the Soviet government newspaper, reported at the time the Gorky was `` one of the biggest and technically best-equipped passenger ships'' of the Soviet maritime fleet.

<HEAD>Armenian Legislature Votes to Annex Karabakh</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Armenian legislature has voted to annex a disputed region in a neighboring republic, an activist said today, in a move that defied the federal government and could cause further ethnic violence. The lawmakers claimed the region, the <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> enclave, on Friday after the national parliament asked <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>'s neighbor, the republic of <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>, to quell tensions over the area, the activist said. The Armenian Supreme Soviet and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </ORGANIZATION> informed the national government of the annexation, the activist, <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Shakhbazyan </PERSON>, said in a telephone interview. The national government probably will not recognize the action, taken in the Armenian capital, <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>'s population is predominantly ethnic Armenian and <PERSON> Christian </PERSON>, but the mountainous region is located in <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>, which is mostly Moslem. Despite being called a Soviet autonomous region, the enclave is supposed to obey the Azerbaijani government in <LOCATION> Baku </LOCATION>. Unconfirmed reports earlier in the week said three people were killed in violence stemming from the dispute, adding to dozens who have been killed in the past 18 months. <PERSON> Shakhbazyan </PERSON>, speaking from <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>, said many Armenian deputies will boycott the second session of the national <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> Deputies which begins Dec. 12 in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. He accused <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> of imposing a new rail blockade on <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> like the one that halted shipment of fuel, food and other goods this fall. No trains had arrived from <LOCATION> Nakhichivan </LOCATION>, a small area of <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> sandwiched between <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, since Nov. 28, he said. Trains were arriving on schedule from the Georgian republic in the north, he reported. The Armenian population, citing what they call years of willful neglect by <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>, began demanding in February 1988 that <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> annex <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> area. <LOCATION> Mosow </LOCATION> has rejected that demand, and in January it imposed direct rule through a commission headed by <PERSON> Arkady </PERSON> <PERSON> Volsky </PERSON>. On Tuesday, the final day of the national Supreme Soviet's fall session, legislators replaced the <PERSON> Volsky </PERSON> commission with a legislative oversight commission. The Supreme Soviet also ordered <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> to work with local officials in <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> to restore order. In the meantime, <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> soldiers are to stay in the area. <LOCATION> Azerbaijani </LOCATION> activists have expressed displeasure with the decision as well. <PERSON> Ekhtibar </PERSON> <PERSON> Mamedov </PERSON>, leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Azerbaijan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> political movement, claimed there was a secret provision in the Supreme Soviet declaration that prevents <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> from interfering in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>'s affairs.

 Hundreds of museums and galleries throughout the country observed AIDS Awareness Day by holding memorial services, temporarily removing art masterpieces to symbolize the disease's ravages in the arts community `` The point of ` A Day Without Art' is to refer metaphorically to loss and to try to get more people as concerned with the loss from AIDS as it is often, with, say, earthquakes and other tragedies that occur,'' said <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Yenawine </PERSON>, director of education at the Museum of Modern Art in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and co-chairman of the nationwide project. Some 600 art institutions participated in the Friday observance, organizers said. A group of arts professionals called Visual AIDS organized `` A Day Without Art'' to coincide with the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>'s second AIDS Awareness Day. Elsewhere, nearly 80 people were arrested in a protest in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> corporate leaders convened in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> to discuss how the business world can better respond to the AIDS epidemic. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, numerous art galleries closed for the day or temporarily darkened their halls. At the <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Picasso </PERSON>'s `` Portrait of <PERSON> Gertrude </PERSON> <PERSON> Stein </PERSON>'' was removed and a placard was put in its place to explain the loss the art community is experiencing because of AIDS. <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, chairwoman of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AIDS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION>, told reporters at the Museum of Modern Art that the observance was just a small reminder of the plague, `` and everybody in this world needs to be reminded time and time again.'' At a 14th Street subway station, artist <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> encouraged people to put the names of dead friends on index cards and tape them to black paper with which he had covered a colorful mural. About 100 demonstrators marched in front of the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> office of the Immigration and <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> to protest the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy of forcing HIV-infected immigrants to get a special waiver. At the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Orono </LOCATION>, workers draped the artwork in black. `` There are huge social losses and artistic losses in the art world'' because of AIDS, said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Shepard </PERSON>, museum director. Similar observances were held in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, where the Arts Exchange gallery was closed; in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>, where lights were dimmed for 10 minutes at the <ORGANIZATION> Carnegie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION>; in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, where large black shrouds were hung over many downtown sculptures; and in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, where visitors to the Museum of Contemporary Art and the <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION> found the usual admission fees waived and were asked instead to donate to the AIDS Project <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, the NO-AIDS task force displayed children's artistic conception of AIDS One simply had the word `` choose'' between the words `` AIDS'' and `` life,'' said <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, a member of the task force. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, nearly 80 demonstrators were arrested Friday after they sat down on <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Avenue </LOCATION> in front of the White House to protest what they called the government's lack of leadership in the AIDS epidemic. Those taking part in the civil disobedience were among some 200 people who attended an earlier rally criticizing President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for what they said was the government's inadequate support for AIDS research and services. At a conference at <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, business leaders attended a variety of seminars on how to deal with acquired immune deficiency syndrome in the workplace. `` A lot more things like these need to be done,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Baumhaur </PERSON>, president of the Fuddruckers hamburger chain and keynote speaker at the conference. `` Every business will be impacted by AIDS. We ca n't ignore it.'' As of the end of October, the federal <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> had recorded 112,241 cases of AIDS in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, with 66,493 deaths. AIDS is caused by a virus that damages the body's immune system, leaving victims susceptible to infections and cancer. It is spread most often through sexual contact, needles or syringes shared by drug abusers, infected blood or blood products, and from pregnant women to their offspring.

<TEXT>
 Two events this past week called attention to a new headache of the technological era: the cost of reducing human exposure to electromagnetic radiation. On Monday, <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> confirmed that it cut radiation from its new large-computer terminals to comply with requests from <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> customers. On Wednesday, a researcher from <ORGANIZATION> Johns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hopkins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> said she had found a link between cancer and human exposure to electromagnetic fields from power lines. The twin developments highlighted public concerns about whether electricity _ the lifeblood of modern society _ could be harming the people it is intended to serve. Most of the discussion so far has focused on whether electromagnetic radiation really is harmful and in what amounts. But even if the early warnings turn out to be overstated, a movement to reduce human exposure to it seems to be well under way. The questions are what steps can be taken to cut exposure and how much will they cost? The reassuring answer is that many steps can be taken easily and cheaply. Even daunting problems may prove easier to solve than many think. <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Slesin </PERSON>, who began putting out <ORGANIZATION> Microwave </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> a decade ago, said the latest developments carry conflicting messages. On the bad side, he said, the <PERSON> Johns </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> study indicated biological effects from alarmingly low levels of electromagnetic radiation. But on the good side, the new <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> displays show that cutting radiation _ at least in the case of video display terminals _ does not always have to be expensive. An <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> official said this past week that the new displays were built about as inexpensively as the old ones. <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>, incidentally, says it produced the new displays only to satisfy customer demands, not because of any health concerns. So far no other companies have followed suit. <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>'s new terminals do n't reduce radiation at a frequency of 60 hertz -LRB- cycles per second -RRB-, the frequency that has been implicated in several medical studies, including the one at <PERSON> Johns </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON>. Sixty hertz radiation is emitted by all kinds of electrical devices, from hair dryers to coffeemakers to larger electricity-powered machines. Fortunately, early studies indicate that any danger is mainly from long-term exposure at sufficiently close ranges. The fields of most devices drop off sharply a few inches away, and people do n't spend all day with them Electric blankets and electrically heated water beds would seem to be possible problems. Although Underwriters Laboratories says it has no reason to believe they are dangerous, there may be better ways to stay warm at night, advises a valuable new 45-page booklet from the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineering </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Carnegie-Mellon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>. Likewise, the hazard of video display terminals, if any, can be minimized by keeping an arm's length from the screen and a greater distance from neighboring terminals. There may even be relatively inexpensive ways to deal with power lines, both the long-distance transmission lines and the high-current distribution lines that go straight into populated areas. According to <PERSON> Slesin </PERSON>, one way to cut power lines' fields is disarmingly simple: Anchor two wires side by side, as in the average extension cord. Their alternating current fields should substantially cancel each other out. Utilities have gotten interested because the public's fear of electromagnetic fields has contributed to long delays in building transmission lines _ even longer than the notorious delays in building new generating plants. Power lines will be `` the knottiest problem of all,'' said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Brodeur </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yorker </ORGANIZATION> magazine writer and author of the newly published `` Currents of Death,'' a critical study of the electromagnetic radiation issue. Still, <PERSON> Brodeur </PERSON> said, `` We live in a vey advanced technological nation. Now that the Cold War appears to be coming to an end, this is not all that big of a deal.'' <PERSON> Slesin </PERSON> agreed: `` I'll make you a bet that with a couple years of research, the electrical utilities will be able to reduce magnetic fields from power lines at relatively low cost by restringing and rewiring the power lines.'' `` I have great confidence in the ingenuity of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> engineers,'' <PERSON> Slesin </PERSON> said. `` We can solve problems if we decide they're worth solving.'' In other business and economic news this past week: _ <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> ministers meeting in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> settled on a production plan that they hope will control surging oil output and head off an expected price slump Its success depends on whether some major <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> producers such as the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION> abide by their output limits. _ The government revised its estimate of third-quarter economic growth upward to 2.7 percent But many economists said they expected much slower growth in the current quarter. According to another report, personal spending fell 0.2 percent in September, the first drop in more than a year.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> did n't come through with a widely expected cut in interest rates this past week, but investors remained optimistic anyway and stock prices rose. `` This was the first sign since the Oct. 13 mini-crash that the stock market has accepted bad news with any grace,'' said Wall Street analyst <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Connolly </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The renewed optimism grew out of the latest economic indicators that point to a fourth-quarter economic slowdown, and expectations that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> will cut short-term interest rates to stimulate growth. Data on October's personal spending and leading indicators and the outlook for November manufacturing growth all declined, while last month's jobless claims rose. `` We now live under the perverse perception that what's bad for the economy is good for the market under the guise that the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> will lower interest rates,'' said <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Jarrett </PERSON>, technical analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Kidder </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peabody </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> jolted the financial markets Monday by signaling that it was not intentionally lowering short-term interest rates, contrary to popular speculation. The loud and clear message came in the form of the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> draining funds from the banking system, which pushed short-term rates higher. The assumption that the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> was allowing short-term rates to fall grew out of a sharp drop the previous week in the federal funds rate, the interest banks charge each another for overnight loans. The new thinking since Monday is that the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> will lower rates, albeit more slowly than expected, thereby stimulating the economy and bolstering sagging corporate profits in the new year. Analysts said this week's stock market activity pointed to a growing optimism following several weeks of uncertainty. Since Oct. 13, when the Dow Jones industrial average tumbled more than 190 points, many investors had shied away from any kind of commitment. Though some blue-chip stocks have been strong, as reflected in the Dow average, the timidity was evident in the broader market, which has languished. Stocks that have performed best are the larger capitalization issues, companies with reputations for long-term, uninterrupted growth. `` There's still some apprehension, but growing confidence,'' said <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, senior vice president at <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Albany </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> `` The reason the market has been this good in the face of a slowing economy is because it anticipates that the slowdown wo n't last that long because the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> will take steps to lower short-term rates.'' Further fueling the argument for lower interest rates is a growing consensus among economists that real GNP growth will slow to roughly 1.5 percent in the final quarter of 1989 from 2.7 percent in the previous three months, analysts said. A surprise rally on Friday ahead of the weekend U.S.-Soviet summit helped boost the Dow Jones Average to a 2,747.65 closing on the week, up 72.10 points from the previous week and the 10th highest finish ever. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> averaged 160.57 million shares a day, up from a daily average of 127.02 million the week before. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> composite index closed the week up 3.37 at 193.66; the <ORGANIZATION> NASDAQ </ORGANIZATION> composite index for the over-the-counter market advanced to 457, up 0.47; and the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> market value index added 2.44 to 375.58. Analysts said the outlook for the market is positive as the year draws to a close and some said they hope for a `` <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Claus </LOCATION> rally.'' Two stimulants may help fuel the upward momentum, said <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldman </PERSON>, vice president of <ORGANIZATION> A.G. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Edwards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sons </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>. `` Professional money managers get a big inflow of corporate profit and pension fund money that gets invested,'' <PERSON> Goldman </PERSON> said. `` Secondly, the Christmas spirit makes people feel good.'' However, <PERSON> Goldman </PERSON> and other analysts say the market might have to give more ground first. `` Markets just do n't go straight up.''

<TEXT>
 One of world's longest insurgencies formally ended today as guerrillas of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Malaya </LOCATION> pledged to lay down their arms and vowed loyalty to <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>. Cease-fire agreements signed by the Communists, <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> brought to a close 41 years of conflict that cost thousands of lives and at one time involved 70,000 British and <ORGANIZATION> Commonwealth </ORGANIZATION> troops. Analysts in <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION> said meager prospects for success, changes sweeping the Communist world and perhaps <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s reluctance to be linked to the insurgency led to the cease-fire Under the agreements, 1,200 guerrillas who operate mostly along the rugged, 375-mile frontier are to lay down their arms and return to civilian life. The Communist Party's general-secretary, <PERSON> Chin </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON>, pledged loyalty to the <LOCATION> Malaysian </LOCATION> government. `` We shall disband our armed units and destroy our weapons to show our sincerity to terminate the armed struggle,'' he said. A joint communique said the Communists had agreed `` to terminate all armed activities and bring peace to the entire Thai-Malaysian border and <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>.'' The communique said <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION> will ensure fair treatment for the disbanded Communists, who began their `` war of liberation'' in 1948 when <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> ruled what was then called <LOCATION> Malaya </LOCATION> as a colony. `` The government of <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION> will in due course allow former members of the disbanded armed units ... to freely participate in political activities within -LRB- the -RRB- framework of the federal constitution and the laws of <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>,'' the statement said. The Communists in turn pledged to respect the laws of the two countries and to participate in social and economic development. <PERSON> Chin </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> said the agreements were `` consistent with the current historical trend where the peoples of the whole world are striving for peace and democracy.'' On the eve of the ceremony, police lifted a 41-year-old curfew in many parts of <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION> because they said there was no longer any threat from the guerrillas. The statement said two agreements were reached, one between <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and the other between <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Operations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> and the Communists The ceremony took place in <LOCATION> Hat </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yai </LOCATION>, a southern <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> city 30 miles from the <LOCATION> Malaysian </LOCATION> border. <PERSON> Chin </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON>, who was last seen outside the Communist world in 1955, signed the agreements along with <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>'s army commander, Gen. <PERSON> Chaovalit </PERSON> <PERSON> Yongchaiyudh </PERSON>, and Wan <ORGANIZATION> Sidek </ORGANIZATION>, secretary-general of the Home Affairs Ministry of <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>. In the late 1940s and 1950s, the <ORGANIZATION> Commonwealth </ORGANIZATION> mobilized 70,000 troops to fight the largely ethnic Chinese insurgents, and the British-led force drove them into the jungle along the Thai-Malaysian border. The British effort ended in 1960 after the deaths of more than 10,000 on both sides. But fighting on a lesser scale continued through the next decade, culminating with several successful Thai-Malaysian border sweeps and a <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> amnesty that enticed large numbers of guerrillas to surrender. Despite the peace agreement, <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION> has no plans to do away with internal security measures that allow for indefinite detention without trial. Prime Minister <PERSON> Mahathir </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohamad </PERSON> told reporters Friday that the law had helped maintain peace in a multiracial country. Critics of <PERSON> Mahathir </PERSON> say the law is used to arrest activists who oppose government policies. About 65 people are being held under the law. Of <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>'s 17 million people, 55 percent are Malays, 37 percent are Chinese and almost all the rest are Indians.

 A <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> mission to help civil war refugees fled after its office was smashed and its members were threatened. <PERSON> Gonzalo </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>, the chief <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> representative here, said the mission of about 30 members was evacuated Friday `` for lack of guarantees'' and that the office will be transferred to <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>. The program was administered by <ORGANIZATION> UNICEF </ORGANIZATION> to help people displaced by the decade-old war between leftist guerrillas and government troops and to sponsor development programs. The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> office in <LOCATION> Escalon </LOCATION> was damaged Wednesday when guerrillas invaded it and the adjoining affluent section of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Benito </LOCATION> on the city's west side. Employees inside the building were evacuated by the <ORGANIZATION> Green </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>, an organization similar to the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>, during a lull in the fighting. Government troops entered the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> office later, <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> said, and an inspection on Thursday, after the guerrillas pulled out of the area, showed extensive destruction. The front of the building was pocked with bullet holes, and equipment and furniture inside appeared to have been deliberately smashed, <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> said. President <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON>'s rightist government did not admit responsibility for the damage. But <PERSON> Ernesto </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferreiro </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>'s protocol chief, said he extended apologies to <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> on behalf of <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON>. On Thursday, more than 240 Americans were evacuated, most from the Escalon-San <PERSON> Benito </PERSON> area. They included private citizens and <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> personnel and dependents. On Friday, <PERSON> Eloy </PERSON> <PERSON> Guevara </PERSON>, a photo stringer working for Agence France-Presse, was killed by gunfire after a clash between guerrillas and government soldiers in the working-class district of <LOCATION> Soyapango </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Guevara </PERSON>, 27, was the 18th journalist killed since the war began in late 1979 and the second since the guerrillas launched an all-out attack, in phases, on the capital Nov. 11. Two reporters at the scene said <PERSON> Guevara </PERSON> was hit by assault rifle fire as he crossed an intersection with three <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> workers, and the fire came from the side of the street controlled by air force paratroopers. Guerrillas had withdrawn from positions on the other side of the street more than an hour before, and military officers on the scene had given the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> workers the go-head to proceed, the witnesses said. Both insisted on not being identified by name for fear of reprisals.

<TEXT>
 Two candidates who want <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> to reassess its relationship with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> took early leads today in this nation's first democratic election Officials reported widespread vote-buying. Long lines of voters waited to cast ballots, and state radio reported a heavy turnout to choose legislators, municipal and county officials. Tens of thousands of police guarded polling places to prevent violence. The election was expected to mark a major step in <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s march toward democracy after four decades of rule by the Nationalists, who lost a civil war to Communist forces on the Chinese mainland in 1949. It was the first election to include opposition candidates and will test the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, legalized at the end of martial law in 1987. Results were expected early Sunday. In all, 722 candidates ran in the legislative, mayoral and county races. The Nationalists can not lose all power in the election. The 256-seat Legislature and the electoral college are dominated by elderly Nationalists elected for life on the Chinese mainland in the late 1940s to support the party's claim that it is the legitimate government of all <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. The electoral college will choose a president next year. The most contentious campaign issue involved some opposition calls for <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s independence, a seditious act under <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s constitution Communist <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has threatened to invade <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> if it declares independence. In one <LOCATION> Taipei </LOCATION> district, candidate <PERSON> Yeh </PERSON> <PERSON> Chu-lan </PERSON>, an independence activist, was among the leaders for a seat in the legislature. Mrs. <PERSON> Yeh </PERSON> is the widow of <PERSON> Cheng </PERSON> <PERSON> Nan-Rong </PERSON>, who killed himself in April to avoid a police investigation for advocating independence for <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>. In her campaign, Mrs. <PERSON> Yeh </PERSON> continued her husband's work and risks prosecution. Incomplete results indicated that Jaw Shau-kong, a popular Nationalist legislator, was far ahead in his <LOCATION> Taipei </LOCATION> district. Jaw has pushed for political reform, calling for the retirement of aging legislators and negotiations with the Communist government in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. In the industrial city of <LOCATION> Kaohsiung </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Hsu </PERSON> <PERSON> Hsiao-dan </PERSON>, a former dancer, model and painter, was behind. Ms. <PERSON> Hsu </PERSON> called for universal love and freedom in her campaign and distributed nude photos of herself. The Independence Evening News today reported large-scale distribution of `` silver bullets,'' or bribes, before campaigning ended Friday. `` Some candidates threw down big bucks,'' it said. The paper's sister publication, the Independence Morning News, was sued for libel by the <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> Friday after it accused the Nationalists of vote-buying. Financial officials have said cash in circulation jumped by $ 1.1 billion in the past week because of vote-buying. During balloting today several voters told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> they had sold their votes. One voter said she sold her and her husband's vote to a <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> candidate for $ 19 each. Other voters said that was the going price, although one women said she only received $ 8 for her vote. A spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> reported scores of cases of vote-buying and intimidation. The spokesman, <PERSON> Ho </PERSON> <PERSON> En-pao </PERSON>, said investigations were under way and that evidence had been found in several cases. He did not disclose which party was to blame. In the only report of violence, a fight broke out in the northwestern city of Hualian after opposition candidates photographed a man voting on behalf of an elderly man. State radio said the elderly man's hands were shaking so he needed help. Election officials said the case was under investigation. <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s three government TV stations initially gave almost exclusive coverage to Nationalist candidates but yielded under pressure from the public. The opposition claimed the Nationalists were helped by an immense party machine that mobilized village chiefs and other politicians to secure votes. Nationalists had also been accused of sabotaging opposition office and shooting an independent candidate. The Nationalists denied the charges.

<TEXT>
 A top <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> official resigned today and accused the East German leadership of being incapable of overseeing the political and economic reforms demanded by the pro-democracy movement. The resignation of <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Hans-Joachim </PERSON> <PERSON> Willerding </PERSON> was another blow to embattled party chief <PERSON> Egon </PERSON> <PERSON> Krenz </PERSON>, who has been trying to gain respect for the party as it faces a challenge to its 40-year monopoly on power. Willerding stepped down a day after the East German public was told how top party leaders took bribes, lived opulent lifestyles, went on luxury vacations and squirreled away billions of dollars in Swiss bank accounts. <PERSON> Willerding </PERSON> told the official <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> news agency that he had no confidence the leadership could gain the authority to lead the drive for democratic change. `` Renewal is possible only when the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leads with unity and determination,'' he said. He called for swift action against former leaders who abused their powers. <PERSON> Willerding </PERSON> was named secretary of the powerful <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and a non-voting member of the ruling Politburo less than a month ago, after <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>'s longtime government was forced to resign. <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION>, 52, has been trying desperately to distance himself from the old guard, of which had been a prominent member. Shaking their heads in disbelief and disgust, members of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> listened Friday to a litany of corruption involving leaders who rigidly maintained a spartan society for their people while indulging in excess. During a nationally televised session that ran late into Friday night, <PERSON> Krenz </PERSON> declared his party's guilt but sought to separate his new leadership from the disgraced figures now ousted from power. Nevertheless, he took responsibility for the party's alleged misuse of power in 40 years of uncontested rule. `` Gross political errors have been committed by my party,'' <PERSON> Krenz </PERSON> told the parliamentary session. `` As leader of the Politburo and the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, I take responsibility for this.'' The party newspaper <PERSON> Neues </PERSON> <PERSON> Deutschland </PERSON> commented today: `` This is all the more painful and incomprehensible in that these people for decades handed out to others the bread of poverty.'' The newspaper declared the old guard Communists to be guilty of `` outright grabbing and misuse of power, corruption, coverups and acts for which there can be no understanding and no forgiveness.'' <PERSON> Heinrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Toeplitz </PERSON>, head of the commission investigating abuse of power, told <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> that <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> and other ousted leaders spent huge sums on hunting lodges, luxury homes and other indulgences. <PERSON> Toeplitz </PERSON> confirmed that accusations against the ousted leaders disclosed before his investigative commission suggest that 100 billion marks -LRB- $ 54 billion -RRB- has been spirited out of the country to Swiss bank accounts. The official news agency <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> said the full, 163-member <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> would meet Sunday to weigh necessary `` consequences'' on the situation in the party. It could decide to expel <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> and others implicated in the corruption reports. <PERSON> Toeplitz </PERSON>'s disclosures led to demands that Foreign Trade Minister <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Beil </PERSON> immediately explain the whereabouts of that money. `` I can not explain this right now, and you would n't want me to be able to,'' <PERSON> Beil </PERSON> contended, saying a broad investigation is needed. He was stopped with shouts of `` Why not?'' and accusations that he and others held over from the former leadership were part of the problem. Former Politburo members <PERSON> Guenter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mittag </PERSON> and <PERSON> Guenther </PERSON> <PERSON> Kleiber </PERSON> were singled out as having pocketed bribes and kickbacks for imported goods purchased at state expense. <PERSON> Mittag </PERSON> already has been ousted from the party. <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> pledged that past mistakes will be corrected, but anti-Communist sentiment has been spreading rapidly in the nation of more than 16 million. The city council of <LOCATION> Plauen </LOCATION> demanded that <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> resign over his alleged role in faking results of municipal elections last summer that gave the Communists an overwhelming majority. <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> is facing growing challenges to his leadership from both the opposition and his own party because of his longtime association with the <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> regime. <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>'s hand-picked successor, took power Oct. 18 after most of the old leaders were ousted by a wave of unrest and the exodus of hundreds of thousands of citizens to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>. Since then, the leadership has instituted sweeping reform, including lifting travel barriers and opening the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall. The Communists are struggling to regain political initiative before the Dec. 7 start of talks with the opposition on the nation's future course. The party has also scheduled an emergency congress for Dec. 15-17. At Friday's <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> session, the Communists were stripped of their guaranteed `` leading role'' mandated by the constitution for 40 years. The legislature also passed a resolution regretting <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s decision to join in the 1968 <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> invasion of <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> that crushed the short-lived `` Prague Spring'' reform era. The resolution offered apologies to the people of <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> and expressed solidarity with the process of reforms going on there. <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>'s Prliament abolished the Communists' leading role Wednesday.

 <PERSON> Vishwanath </PERSON> <PERSON> Pratap </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, who led an opposition coalition to defeat the <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> government, was sworn in today as <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s prime minister. <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, 58, a former king who now heads the five-party <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> coalition </ORGANIZATION>, will preside over the first minority government <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> has had since it became independent from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> 42 years ago. <PERSON> Devi </PERSON> <PERSON> Lal </PERSON>, 75, also of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, was sworn in as deputy prime minister. <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, a poet and painter, must now name his other <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> ministers and win a vote of confidence from the majority of the 525 members of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>'s policy-making lower house. He has 30 days to prove his support in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. President <PERSON> Ramaswamy </PERSON> <PERSON> Venkataraman </PERSON> administered the oath of office, and <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> smiled as the crowd in an ornate chamber of the presidential palace burst into applause. `` I will do my duty,'' <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> told reporters after the 10-minute ceremony. `` My government will be a government of the people.'' Former Prime Minister <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>, now consigned to the role of opposition leader, was one of the first to offer congratulations. `` I wish him well,'' he said. `` I hope he completes his five-year term.'' <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> was <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s finance and defense minister until 1987, when he resigned amid reports his investigations into government corruption were proving embarrassing to <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>. One of <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s last acts was to free a Sikh member of Parliament who was accused of plotting the 1984 assassination of <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s mother, Prime Minister <PERSON> Indira </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> reported. The government today withdrew all charges against <PERSON> Simranjit </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> <PERSON> Mann </PERSON> and four others. The shots that killed Mrs. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> on Oct. 31, 1984, were fired by two of her Sikh bodyguards. One was shot to death by other bodyguards. The surviving gunman and a Sikh government clerk convicted in the plot were hanged in January. Pakistani Prime Minister <PERSON> Benazir </PERSON> <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> today congratulated her new Indian counterpart. In a message to <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> released to reporters, she said <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> would `` make its full contribution towards strengthening peace and stability in our region.'' The two nations have fought three wars since 1947 and have thousands of troops on their borders. For the past two years, <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> led the efforts to unite the country's usually disparate opposition parties into a cohesive bloc against <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. He is modest and vacillating, an unlikely leader for an ideologically diverse coalition in the world's most populous democracy. <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, born to a rajah, became king of the <LOCATION> Manda </LOCATION> district in northern <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> but gave away his small kingdom to members of the lower castes long before royal titles were outlawed in 1971. He capitalized on a desire for change in attracting factions from the left and right to support his coalition and oust the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> for only the second time since independence. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s first prime minister, <PERSON> Jawaharlal </PERSON> <PERSON> Nehru </PERSON>; his daughter, Prime Minister <PERSON> Indira </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>; and her son, <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON>, all carried the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> banner to power. The only other show of opposition unity came in 1977, when Mrs. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> was defeated. The anti-Congress coalition, however, only lasted 29 months. Given the fragilility of both his formal and informal coalition, <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> may have trouble enacting any major changes. His National Front is a centrist alliance, but to win a vote of confidence in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, he is dependent upon the allegiance of far-right and far-left parties. The Nov. 22-26 elections gave the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> has only 144 seats in the lower house of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> _ far short of the 263 majority needed to carry a motion. But it has pledges of support from the Hindu fundamentalist <ORGANIZATION> Bharatiya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Janata </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and several communist parties. Combined with the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> could muster 283 votes _ and probably a few more from independents and tiny parties whose have not declared their allegiances. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> has 192 seats plus the allegiance of 17 more legislators from regional parties. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> became prime minister after his mother's assassination in 1984, winning a four-fifths parliamentary majority. His early promises to root out corruption started to bear fruit under a series of tax raids conducted by <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>.

 Rebel troops occupying a luxury hotel today opened fire on government forces and defied President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s ultimatum to `` surrender or die.'' Government warplanes and helicopters pounded rebel positions near the armed forces headquarters, but troops had held their fire in the country's financial center, saying they did n't want to endanger Christmas shoppers. The government said it had defeated the coup attempt that nearly ousted Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> on Friday and described today's fighting as mopping up operations. At least 42 people have been killed and more than 200 wounded. Mutineers were reported, however, to still hold an air base in the central <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. Hundreds of rebels swarmed over the financial center of <LOCATION> Makati </LOCATION>, where many foreign diplomats and businessmen live, and roamed through affluent shopping centers. Rebels also entered the Intercontinental Hotel and barred non-guests. At about 11 p.m. gunfire broke out near the hotel, with snipers firing toward loyalist troops. Witnesses said pro-government units of the <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> were moving toward the Intercontinental and the nearby, Japanese-owned <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> Garden Hotel with armored vehicles. Earlier, gunmen fired at the home of Foreign Secretary <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Manglapus </PERSON>, but he was not there. Gunmen also killed 14 soldiers and a bystander, but police said the assailants may have been Communist insurgents unconnected to the coup. The military said it captured a coup leader early today, and another renegade officer believed to be behind the coup issued a statement urging citizens to support the military mutiny. A radio station broadcast what it said was a statement by the suspected leaders of Friday's coup attempt demanding Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> resign to pave the way for a referendum on a new form of government. Sporadic fighting continued near <LOCATION> Camp </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aguinaldo </LOCATION>, headquarters of the armed forces near <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>. Jets and helicopter gunships strafed and rocketed suspected rebel positions, forcing thousands of civilians to flee their homes. Air force jets accidentally strafed 2,000 pro-government troopers near <LOCATION> Camp </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aguinaldo </LOCATION>, mistaking them for mutineers. At least six of the loyalist soldiers were killed and 20 wounded. <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>'s international airport remained closed for a second day, and all domestic flights from the capital were canceled. Opposition Sen. <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ponce </PERSON> <PERSON> Enrile </PERSON>, who was fired as defense minister after a failed coup in 1986, said the situation showed the government had lost control of most of its 160,000-member military. Friday's assault by rebellious members of the army and marines was the sixth attempt to topple Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> since she was swept to power in the 1986 civilian-military uprising that ousted <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>. The rebels attacked the presidential palace, military garrisons and television stations, prompting Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> to ask for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> F-4 Phantom fighters to provide air cover for her counterattacking forces. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> authorized the aid, and the rebels abandoned most of the bases they had overrun. The opposition <ORGANIZATION> Nacionalista </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> President </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Salvador </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laurel </ORGANIZATION> condemned the decision to call for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> help as a `` brazen violation and insult'' to national sovereignty. A statement issued in the name of renegade Lt. Col. <PERSON> Gregorio </PERSON> `` Gringo'' <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON> also denounced Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> for requesting <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> support. The statement, delivered to news organzations and written in ink, urged citizens to support mutineers for `` the attainment of a genuine Filipino government.'' The government has never publicly identified <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON> as a leader of the latest coup attempt. But rebel sources said he was among the key planners. <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON>, who backed a movement to reform the military, led an August 1987 coup attempt that also nearly toppled the government. He remains at large. Meanwhile, Maj. <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Gutierrez </PERSON> said one of the coup leaders, Lt. Col. <PERSON> Tito </PERSON> <PERSON> Legazpi </PERSON>, was arrested after taking part in an attack on the <LOCATION> Sangley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION> naval air station outside <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>, which the rebels briefly held. It was one of the sites <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warplanes flew over to provide air cover to pro-government forces. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities said the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> warplanes fired no shots. <PERSON> Legazpi </PERSON> was a <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON> associate wanted for the August 1987 coup attempt. <PERSON> Gutierrez </PERSON> said four other people were captured with <PERSON> Legazpi </PERSON>. Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Rodolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Biazon </PERSON>, chief of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Region </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>, said he expected government forces to `` finish off'' the rebels by the end of the day. But attacks by the government's helicopter gunships continued near sunset. In the working-class district of <LOCATION> Navotas </LOCATION>, gunmen in a passenger jeep fired at a <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> station, killing 14 soldiers and a civilian, and fleeing with the victims' pistols. Police said the killers may have been Communist rebels taking advantage of the chaos caused by the coup attempt. During a nationally televised news conference, Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> said: `` We shall not entertain any offer to negotiate from those who have shamelessly betrayed the solemn oath of a soldier to defend the Constitution. We leave them two choices: surrender or die.'' She identified 12 officers, whom she promised would be hunted down for their role in the coup attempt. They included Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Commendador </PERSON>, commander of the <LOCATION> Mactan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Air </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Base </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Cebu </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, 350 miles south of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>. The base remained under rebel control. In <LOCATION> Legazpi </LOCATION>, 220 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>, mutineers agreed to evacuate the city airport after talks with local officials and priests. They surrendered their vehicles but were allowed to return to their barracks with their weapons.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s election debacle had two main causes. One of them he could have controlled: His aloofness from the people who five years ago overwhelmingly endorsed him as their leader. The other he was powerless to fight: An impatient desire for change in a developing nation, where voters think the fastest way to improve things is to throw out the old leader and usher in a new one. The legacy of a powerful family brought <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> to the prime minister's office, but it was not enough to keep him there. He repeatedly invoked the achievements of his famous forebears _ his grandfather, <PERSON> Jawaharlal </PERSON> <PERSON> Nehru </PERSON>, and his mother, <PERSON> Indira </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>, both also prime ministers. But <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> failed to preserve the initial wave of euphoria that propelled him into the prime minister's job after Mrs. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s assassination. For only the second time in modern <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s 42 years as a free nation, <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> failed to win a majority of seats in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>'s policy-making lower house, the Lok Sabha. The Nov. 22-26 elections failed to give anyone a decisive mandate, but one thing was clear: The <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> was no longer the overwhelming choice of the people, although it won 192 votes, more than any other single party. A centrist coalition called the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, formed early this year at the instigation of one-time <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> ally <PERSON> Vishwanath </PERSON> <PERSON> Pratap </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, captured 144 seats in the new <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> managed to galvanize other opposition parties, ranging from communists to Hindu fundamentalists, into an unwieldy but _ for the moment at least _ effective alliance. Together this motley crew commands 283 of the 525 seats the <LOCATION> Lok </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sabha </LOCATION>, or House of the People. On Saturday, President <PERSON> Ramaswamy </PERSON> <PERSON> Venkataraman </PERSON> installed <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> as prime minister. Almost until the very end, the gap between the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and the people was so great that <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> and his closest aides were unable to grasp the fact they were losing. `` They woke up very late. They did n't know that a campaign was going against them since 1987. They were hopelessly out of touch,'' said <PERSON> Vinod </PERSON> <PERSON> Dua </PERSON>, a political commentator who served as co-host of state-run television's election coverage and analysis. `` Even as I was on TV seeing the results, their spokesmen were saying they were going to win,'' <PERSON> Dua </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, who served as <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s finance and defense minister before his tax raids and anti-corruption investigations struck too close to home in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> ranks, resigned from the Cabinet in the spring of 1987. A few months later he was expelled from the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for `` anti-party activities.'' <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>, meanwhile, failed to recognize the mounting groundswell against him, remaining confident voters would never again trust opposition politicians who were elected to power only once before _ for 29 months in 1977-79. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s mother was ousted at that time but swept back to power in 1980 after the intervening government started bickering and fell apart. <PERSON> Ashis </PERSON> <PERSON> Nandy </PERSON>, a psychologist who switched to political science and is now an analyst at <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>'s Center for the <ORGANIZATION> Study </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Developing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Societies </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> also failed to meet the rising aspirations of a Third World country of 880 million people, most of whom have yet to cast off the shackles of poverty, disease and illiteracy. `` This is a society where the middle classes have emerged as a great voter bank,'' <PERSON> Nandy </PERSON> said, estimating their numbers at 200 million to 250 million. `` But this is still a minority. ... It's absolutely stupid the contempt for the other Indians that this middle class shows. And the middle class _ the people who read newspapers, have money to spend, are politically aware _ also began to tire of their government, he said. Two years ago, <PERSON> Nandy </PERSON> predicted that <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> was headed for a series of one-term leaders as a restless electorate looked for a changes in its life that did not come as fast as desired. `` Had there not been a Mr. <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, the Indian middle classes would have invented him,'' <PERSON> Nandy </PERSON> wrote in an article published by the Indian Express in August 1987. `` The moral of the story is this: After riding through the first half of its term in style, a regime in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> today tends to lose credibility dramatically, irrespective of the quality or nature of the leadership.'' In an interview last week, <PERSON> Nandy </PERSON> noted that when <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> came to power in 1984, he promised to root out the corruption endemic in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>. But after 2 -LCB- years, the corruption was still there. So was the unwieldy bureaucracy, the labrythine court system, the illiteracy rate of 64 percent. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>, in taking credit for changes he had made, such as loosening up the economy for investment and easing strained relations with <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, also took the fall for things that had gone wrong or had not improved. At the same time, <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> turned his back on the bosses in the party whose ticket had brought him to power. His confidantes and aides included personal friends with no experience in politics. He reshuffled his Cabinet at least 20 times in five years, never quite attaining a workable combination. One of his closest aides, who ended up managing the fraud - and violence-marred election campaign in <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s own constituency, was a fellow pilot from the prime minister's days at <ORGANIZATION> Indian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> His speech writer was a man of biting wit who sometimes peppered the prime minister's addresses with barbs aimed at the very people he was supposed to be honoring. His official spokesman was aloof and often unavailable to the reporters who covered <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s daily activities. And there were few places in the country where the Cambridge-educated <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> and his Italian wife <PERSON> Sonia </PERSON> seemed to belong _ certainly not in his own dirt-poor constituency of <LOCATION> Amethi </LOCATION>, no matter how many electricity poles and blacktopped roads he pumped into it. Fluent and confident in English, he sounded squeaky, even hesitant, in Hindi, mispronouncing words and throwing in English phrases. He was outclassed at his campaign rallies by local orators who warmed up the crowds and tried to keep them from leaving before the prime minister arrived, sometimes hours behind schedule. The <LOCATION> Nehru-Gandhi </LOCATION> dynasty brought <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> to power, but it did n't keep him there His mother suffered the same lesson in 1977, but she managed to rebound in less than three years and hold on until her assassination in 1984. Some doubt whether her son has the same stamina, even if his nemesis <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> falters.

<HEAD>Two Senior Politicians Released from Prison to House Arrest</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KHARTOUM, Sudan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government released from prison two senior politicians jailed since a June 30 military coup but is keeping them under house arrest, a government source and their associates said Saturday. An official source, who refused to be further identified, confirmed a newspaper report on the disposition of <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> <PERSON> Turabi </PERSON>, head of the fundamentalist <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Mohamed </PERSON> <PERSON> Osman </PERSON> <PERSON> Mirghani </PERSON>, head of the centrist <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unionist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. The source would give no further details, but followers of the two said they were transferred from Kober Prison in suburban <LOCATION> Khartoum </LOCATION>. Several politicians remain incarcerated at the prison, chief among them the ousted prime minister, <PERSON> Sadek </PERSON> <PERSON> el-Mahdi </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Umma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. The official newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Al-Sudan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Al-Hadith </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Turabi </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mirghani </PERSON> were released `` after they voiced their support for the revolution'' and the policies of the military government, which include disbanding <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION>'s 36 political parties. `` They have not been implicated in recent communist plots aiming to undermine the revolution,'' the newspaper said. That seemed to indicate the ruling junta is implicating el-Mahdi and <PERSON> Mohamed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ibrahim </PERSON> <PERSON> Nugud </PERSON>, secretary-general of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, both still in prison, in a week-long strike by doctors. The government has blamed communists for the illegal strike. In addition to the parties, coup leader Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Omar </PERSON> <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> <PERSON> el-Bashir </PERSON> disbanded all the country's professional associations and trade unions. He jailed most senior government officials and vowed to try them on charges of political and economic corruption. Only a handful have been put on trial. The government says about 20 officials remain in detention, but informed sources put the figure at close to 100.

<TEXT>
 The panic in the eyes of a man grabbed by riot police. Shabby East German Trabants and sleek West German Mercedes side by side on the Kurfuerstendamm in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> after the Berlin Wall crumbled. The explosion of joy in <LOCATION> Wenceslas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> when the hated leaders that suppressed the <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> Spring reforms 20 years ago had to step down. Those are some of the lasting images of a turbulent month that ended an era in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Millions of people demanded a say in politics and took their fear, their courage and their joy into the streets. Here are some images of that breathtaking month: Oct. 28: Beloved <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>, city of a thousand spires, marred again by hundreds of riot police hounding peaceful pro-democracy demonstrators down alleys and sidestreets. Wenceslas Square, a tree-lined boulevard at the heart of the city, resembles a police camp. A hapless Pole tries to explain to a police officer he is on the square by mistake. Suddenly, a riot policeman charges, slams him against a wall and beats him in a display of the kind of violence that kept East Europeans in check most of the last four decades. Nov. 3-4: In <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> again, but East Germans are the drama. Thousands of them cram into the West German Embassy, another wave of East Germans heading West through <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>. Amid the jubilation, a prescient diplomat, scarcely believing he could be right, mutters, `` The wall has gone.'' Nov. 5: <PERSON> Pomezi </PERSON>, a Czech village sandwiched between East and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. A chill dawn beside the dilapidated church. Scores of East German Trabant cars arrive at the border every hour, carrying their occupants away from a lifetime under communism. A <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION> worker tells how he got caught in the <LOCATION> Dresden </LOCATION> train station on the bloody night of Oct. 3-4 and saw riot police beating back thousands trying to get aboard trains carrying East Germans to the West. `` I saw them beat children,'' he says. `` That was when my wife and I decided to leave. We were always told the DDR -LRB- <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> -RRB- was a state of peace.'' Nov. 6: <LOCATION> Bratislava </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, in the rain. Another side of repression. In court, <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Carnogursky </PERSON>, a Slovak dissident, facing up to 10 years in jail over just one article in an underground newspaper. Breaking through the barrier of fear that keeps most people far from the courtroom, a crowd of 200 gathers in the name of freedom under the watchful eyes of uniformed police and plainclothes officers who film them from the window. Later, activists talk warmly of the popular revolt in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Soon, soon, they say, it must come to <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>. Nov. 9-10: East and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. A night of delirium as the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall really does open. For this moment, there are no words. Car horns honk and people scream, weep and embrace. Even hardened <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> punkers have tears in their eyes. An East German family sharing my 2 a.m. taxi ride around a city they have n't seen for 28 years is dumbstruck. What the mother really could n't believe, as we inched our way through the Trabants around <ORGANIZATION> Bahnhof </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zoo </ORGANIZATION>, was that fresh flowers were on sale in the middle of the night. Nov. 13: <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION>. First taste of the center of the East German revolution, when 200,000 people roar across <LOCATION> Karl </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Marx </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>, `` We are the people!'' Everyone is there _ young and old, religious believers and Communists, students and workers. `` I'll be here until we have free elections,'' says a 70-year-old woman, with the unbending Teutonic resolve that has powered the revolt. `` We are the generation that was most betrayed. Maybe the children will have it better.'' Nov. 17: <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION>. New fears replace the old. An ethnic German family who abandoned a prosperous farm in <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> 25 years ago sits at home, worrying. Will the opening of the borders mean a currency reform? `` We'll lose everything again,'' shudders the mother, two years away from a meager East German pension with only savings in East German marks to rely on. Nov. 20: <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> as people dreamed to see it ever since the day the 1968 `` Prague Spring'' was over, crushed by <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact troops and tanks. More than 100,000 people are on the streets saying `` No more!'' to police brutality and Stalinist rule. The procession is an explosion of Czech wit, pride and joy. A friend leaps toward me and his wife, hugging us tight with happiness. `` We made it,'' he cries. Nov. 24: <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON> returns triumphantly to <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> after 19 years in the political wilderness. On a balcony, <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON> bows to the cheers, smiling broadly his hands outstretched in thanks. Then, he reaches toward the crowd and makes a movement as if to draw the 300,000 people to his breast. The vast crowd goes mad with joy. A day later, a photograph capturing the moment goes up in the windows of the state news agency. Nov. 27. Wenceslas Square is a sea of people and national flags and even the clocks stop for the noontime general strike, the biggest protest against 41 years of Communist rule. Hundreds of thousands sway like a huge soccer crowd as they derisively chant the name of <PERSON> Miroslav </PERSON> <PERSON> Stepan </PERSON>, the sacked <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> party boss they blame for past police brutality. `` We'll be so happy if we can have back the people who had to leave this country,'' exults a villager from north <LOCATION> Bohemia </LOCATION>, in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> for the past week to drink in the most exciting days of the revolution. `` Everybody's expecting to spend Christmas together.'' `` What fascinates me,'' says a woman, `` is how all of a sudden people like each other.'' She is standing 50 feet from the spot where, just a month ago _ an era ago _ the policeman beat the Pole.

<HEAD>Ceausescu Criticizes Party, Food Distribution</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Romanian leader <PERSON> Nicolae </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> leveled unusual criticism at his ruling <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and called for a program to modernize the food industry and improve consumer distribution, the state-run Agerpres news agency said Saturday. In recent weeks, <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> has shown an increasing interest in improving the supply of food to the population, in what observers speculate could be an attempt to appease the population and avert the reform demands sweeping the rest of <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> made his remarks Friday at the first meeting of the Politburo since he was unanimously re-elected party leader last week at a party congress. At that congress, <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> reaffirmed his opposition to reform. <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>, who rigidly controls government and party affairs in <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>, admitted at Friday's meeting that `` a number of problems emerged in the area of trade and proper supplies to the population,'' Agerpres reported. Under <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>'s centralized command economy, <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>, once the breadbasket of <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, rations basic food staples such as meat, white flour, cooking oil and bread. Fresh vegetables and fruit are scarce, even in spring and summer. <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> said a `` special program was required to modernize the food and light industries, better organize the shopping network and to meet the comsumer demands,'' Agerpres reported, adding that <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> said the shortages would be remedied within two years. Leveling unusual criticism at his party and its work, <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> said the Politburo and the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> must be improved. He said it was `` essential to ... strengthen the sense of responsibility, order and discipline for the firm application of the laws and the party decisions,'' Agerpres reported. <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> called on the party leadership to improve communication with local party leaders and not take any decision that has not been discussed `` with the whole party.''

 The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Operations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> urged the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration Saturday to clear the way for use of federal funds for research into the infertility problem plaguing millions of American couples. Government unwillingness to fund research has slowed the search for ways to improve in vitro fertilization and other high-tech solutions to infertility, according to the report issued Saturday. In vitro fertilization, in which an egg is fertilized in a laboratory dish and then implanted in the womb, `` has changed from a rarely used technique to an established medical procedure'' over the last decade, the report said. But it added that `` only 6 percent of initial in vitro fertilization procedures result in the birth of a baby.'' About 2.4 million American couples can not have children because of infertility problems, the report said. Right to life groups have opposed infertility research because it involves studying fertilized eggs. Five Republicans on the 39-member committee disagreed with the report's recommendation, saying the issue goes beyond religion. They said `` hundreds of infertility clinics have been established across the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as part of a billion-dollar industry serving people in need ... Given the strong private sector involvement in fighting infertility, perhaps this is not the best use of scarce tax dollars.'' The decision, in any case, should be made by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and not the administration, they said. For a decade, government funding for in vitro fertilization research has been caught in a bureaucratic tangle involving an <ORGANIZATION> Ethics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> that first gave its approval, then went out of business and has never been reconstituted. The report recommended that research on in vitro fertilization be exempt from review by the board and instead be subject to approval by the director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>. It also recommended that the board be reconstituted to pass judgment on other controversial research. The report said that as a result of the lack of effective treatment for infertility, many couples who can not conceive are `` exploited'' by health care professionals who claim to be specialists in the field but yield few successful pregnancies. A 1988 report by the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assessment </ORGANIZATION> said that more than half of the 169 in vitro fertility clinics in existence at that time had not produced a live birth but patients were not told of their lack of success. Patients pay an average of $ 9,376 for two in vitro fertilization attempts, the report said. Additionally, because this is a method of last resort, these patients have already spent an average $ 13,000 on previous infertility treatments, it said. Most in vitro clinics have waiting lists of patients, some as long as one to two years, the report said. The report also recommended an increase in federal funding to prevent sexually transmitted diseases that cause infertility. The Centers for Disease Control estimates that 125,000 cases of infertility related to sexually transmitted diseases occur every year. <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> also estimates that about half of these women want to have children. The report is based on an investigation by the human resources and intergovernmental relations subcommittee, which is chaired by Rep. <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, and was issued by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Operations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>.

 Israeli-backed militia gunners shelled the southern market town of <LOCATION> Nabatiyeh </LOCATION> on Saturday, killing three Shiite Moslem people and wounding nine, police reported. A police spokesman said the casualties occurred during a three-hour barrage by gunners of the Israeli-allied <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lebanon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> militia in the crowded market town, which has a population of about 100,000. The spokesman, who can not be named in line with regulations, said the attack started after fighters of the mainstream <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> militia ambushed an <ORGANIZATION> SLA </ORGANIZATION> squad on a road east of <LOCATION> Nabatiyeh </LOCATION>. `` SLA casualties could not be determined, but judging by the retaliatory artillery barrage, it seems they've had some fatalities,'' the spokesman said. The 2,500-strong <ORGANIZATION> SLA </ORGANIZATION>, backed by <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops, patrols a narrow strip of south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> referred to by the Jewish state as the security zone. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> carved out the 328-square-mile zone when it withdrew the bulk of its invading army from south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in the summer of 1985, ending a three-year occupation of the region.

 The almost $ 1 billion American aid program for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> is spawning a whole new industry as government officials and private analysts assess opportunities in the Eastern bloc. `` It's really exciting,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Flanigan </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> which is preparing to send its first volunteers to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> in 20 years. Perhaps 65 people _ mainly English teachers _ will go to <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> next summer and <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> is expected to get volunteers as well. The <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> is one of many agencies with a stake in the `` Support for East European Democracy Act'' passed by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and signed last week by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. The package provides $ 938 million in benefits over three years, with <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> receiving the lion's share. The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> will provide food aid and the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has $ 200 million earmarked for economic stabilization. The <ORGANIZATION> Export-Import </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> will extend credit to exporters, the <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> will set up a scholarship program and the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> will help retrofit a commercial powerplant in <LOCATION> Krakow </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> will work to improve water quality in that city and the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> will help Poles establish job training programs. Perhaps the most novel parts of the aid program are the `` enterprise funds,'' one for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and another for <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. The non-profit funds, to be run by private citizens, will make loans, grants and guarantees to small businesses and agricultural units. <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s fund gets $ 45 million next year, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s $ 5 million. With the Iron Curtain in shreds, businessmen, consultants, bankers and academics are hustling to learn more about what the future holds. `` We've had lots of calls, lots of interest,'' said <PERSON> Myra </PERSON> <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Polish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, a group that represents more than 8 million Americans of Polish descent. She said callers included would-be investors and consultants with an eye to conducting management seminars. One of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s best-known Polish-Americans, former national security advisor <PERSON> Zbigniew </PERSON> <PERSON> Brzezinski </PERSON>, has been bombarded by callers seeking his views, according to his secretary. So eager are people to bone up on the situation that a seminar at the conservative <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, a think tank, on `` What are <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Interests Behind the Crumbling Iron Curtain'' attracted a standing-room only crowd. The next day, former <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> chaired a panel discussion on business opportunities in Eastern European at a conference put on by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. At the <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>, the lead agency for assistance, officials are still working on details of how to operate the first aid program in <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> countries with state economies. `` We're still getting ourselves organized,'' said one AID official. The course to be followed by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will be determined in part by the recommendations of a presidential delegation that returns to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> after spending five days in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> this weekend. Agriculture Secretary <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> headed the delegation which included <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON>. While <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government aid is important, <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON>, an expert of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> European affairs at the <ORGANIZATION> Carnegie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Endowment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION>, said `` government money is not going to be a major force'' in redevelopment. More important, he said, will be the willingness of businessmen to make long-term investments. Moreover, he said the Europeans, particularly the Germans and the Italians, have an edge in doing business in the <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bloc </LOCATION> countries because they have experiences and contacts in the area.

<HEAD>Moslem Girls Decide to Take Off Controversial Scarves</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CREIL, France (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Two Moslem girls whose insistence on wearing Islamic scarves to school kicked off a national debate announced Saturday that they would take off the controversial headgear in class. The 13 - and 14-year-old sisters, <PERSON> Fatima </PERSON> and <PERSON> Leila </PERSON> <PERSON> Achaboun </PERSON>, said they would bow to the request by their principal at <ORGANIZATION> Gabriel-Havez </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in the northern <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Creil </LOCATION> and take off their `` hijabs. They gave no explanation of their decision to lower the hijabs to their shoulders while in the classroom. A third student in <LOCATION> Creil </LOCATION>, 15-year-old <PERSON> Samira </PERSON> <PERSON> Saidani </PERSON>, continues to refuse to abide by the school's request. Wearing the hijab, which covers the hair, ears and neck, has stirred debate over the separation of church and state in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. The principle of secularity in public schools has been the law in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> since the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> was officially separated from the state in 1905. The controversy began in <LOCATION> Creil </LOCATION> when the school principal, <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Chenieres </PERSON>, applied the 1937 law prohibiting all religious symbols in school and denied the three girls the right to attend class until they removed the scarves. The girls refused. Similar cases arose in other <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> cities, and the arguments became linked to the issue of immigration, particularly attitudes toward immigrants from Moslem countries in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. On Monday, the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> ruled that the girls could wear the religous headgear if it did not cause disruptions. The ruling by the council, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s highest administrative authority, left the decision up to school authorities to judge on a case-by-case basis.

<TEXT>
 Sometime in the future, when yet-unborn statisticians open a time capsule in <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, they will confront a slick wooden ruler-like stick coated with tiny numbers and lines. It is a slide rule, as anyone who had not made it to high school physics or chemistry by, say, the mid-1960s might not know. A slide rule, says the Encyclopedia Americana, is `` a mechanical device for making rapid mathematical calculations accurate to several significant figures.'' To the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, marking its 150th anniversary, the slide rule was the perfect mathematical relic to symbolize the past. A fancy solar calculator was encapsuled to represent the present and a computer chip to stand for the future. The slide rule, invented in the 1620s or 1630s by an English mathematician, was nearly universally replaced by the calculator around 20 years ago. Has society lost something in the transition? `` No,'' says <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Eddy </PERSON>, professor of statistics at <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Carnegie-Mellon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` Slide rules are inherently slower and more painful to use. They're less accurate, too, because they're analog as opposed to digital. Of all the things in the capsule, it is the least statistical.'' <PERSON> Eddy </PERSON> was a member of the committee that chose what went into the time capsule, which was implanted in a column in the <ORGANIZATION> ASA </ORGANIZATION>'s headquarters last week in <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> suburb The capsule is to be opened in 50 years or a century _ that decision to be left to the statisticians of the future. The 15,000-member organization believes itself to be the country's oldest national professional association. Its members have included nurse <PERSON> Florence </PERSON> <PERSON> Nightingale </PERSON>, telephone inventor <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> <PERSON> Bell </PERSON>, steelmaker <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Carnegie </PERSON> and American president <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Buren </PERSON>. The committee conferred by mail and phone and spent a day last August in deliberations to select the one cubic foot of objects that went into the time capsule. Also encapsuled: the transcript of a speech by former Sen. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON>, D-Wis., to the ASA's meeting last summer; a 15-minute videotape on `` What Is Statistics''; the front section of last Monday's <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>; a copy of an 1875 letter from Ms. <PERSON> Nightingale </PERSON> together with `` An Annual Sanitation Report'' from <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> that she sent along; a yellow and a blue ASA T-shirt; and, `` to prove statisticians have a sense of humor,'' says <PERSON> Eddy </PERSON>, a Batman button. A few lottery tickets were thrown in too. `` Lotteries hold a great fascination for statisticians,'' <PERSON> Eddy </PERSON> said, `` because they ca n't figure out why people play them, given the odds.''

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> began a storm-tossed summit today with five hours of talks, and the White House said afterward the two men worked in a `` spirit of forward-looking cooperation.'' The president and his Soviet counterpart `` recognized that economic and political challenges were ahead for <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, and vowed to consider the opportunities presented with sensitivity and firm initiative,'' said the statement issued by <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>. High winds and rough seas forced the two men to scrap plans to talk aboard a Soviet naval vessel anchored off-shore, opting instead for a session on a docked Soviet cruise liner that served as <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s headquarters for the two-day summit. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> returned to his headquarters on the <ORGANIZATION> USS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Belknap </ORGANIZATION> following the initial sessions. The White House said an afternoon round of talks were put on hold because of the bad weather, which kept <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> from immediately leaving the <PERSON> Belknap </PERSON>. The White House said they talked `` almost continuously'' for nearly five hours, including a session with aides and a session with only note-takers, and then continued their talks over lunch. `` President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spoke for more than an hour to open the meeting, laying out more than a dozen ideas for economic and political progress in U.S.-Soviet relations,'' the statement said. `` The discussion ranged from the economic situation in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> to arms control and <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Chairman <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> spoke at length of perestroika and the goals of his reform program,'' it said. The two men also arranged to have an afternoon of talks before getting together for dinner. The summit concludes on Sunday. The White House said the opening talks included a ` ` very productive, informal and substantive meeting. `` The meetings were sparked by a spirit of forward-looking cooperation during these increasingly changing times,'' it said. The White House said the discussion ranged from the economic situation in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> to arms control and <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. `` Chairman <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> spoke at length of perestroika and the goals of his reform program,'' it said. `` The president emphasized his support for the success of perestroika. He set forth his ideas as a broad framework for actions that would help the two nations work together for peace and prosperity,'' it said. The two leaders, both in an affable mood, met aboard the 25,000-ton Maxim Gorky, which is <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s headquarters for the weekend summit, to begin nearly 12 hours of scheduled talks that could bring down the curtain on the Cold War. `` I think we've got a very good beginning of the dialogue ... an excellent beginning,'' Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> told reporters after <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> completed their initial three-hour session. Senior Soviet officials said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> wants the summit to produce a timetable for completing U.S.-Soviet treaties on reducing strategic nuclear weapons, conventional forces in central <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and chemical weapons. These officials, who spoke only on condition they not be identified, said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> will convene a meeting of <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact leaders in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> on Monday to discuss the results of the two-day summit. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will spend Monday briefing allied leaders at <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> were smiling and in high spirits as they clasped hands across a long rectangular table, measuring barely a yard across. `` It's so narrow that if we do n't have enough arguments, we'll kick each other,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> told <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> Asked by reporters if they would reach any agreements, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> replied, `` da, da -LRB- yes, yes -RRB-.'' Agreement on what? he was asked. `` Mnogovo,'' which was translated as meaning `` a lot of things.'' When <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was asked the same question, the president echoed <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. `` Mnogovo,'' he said. The two leaders met in the plush surroundings of a library-like room known as the Card Room, next to the ship's lounge and nightclub, on the Maxim Gorky's promenade deck. They sat in deep captain's chairs, accompanied by aides on either side. Arms control, East-West trade and the breathtaking democratic reforms sweeping communist <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> dominated the agenda for the Bush-Gorbachev talks. Both leaders said they hoped their discussions would strengthen long-term prospects for world peace and <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> unity. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, asked if he would discuss fast-moving political changes in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, replied, `` We'll be discussing everything, including that.'' The senior Soviet sources said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> wants a Stategic Arms Reduction Treaty ready for signing at his next planned summit meeting with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> next spring or early summer. They said the Soviet leader also is seeking a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> commitment to attend a 35-nation summit at the end of 1990 to sign a separate accord sharply reducing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet troops in central <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The original site for the first summit session was the Soviet guided missile cruiser Slava, anchored near the <PERSON> Belknap </PERSON> in this harbor, but White House officials said the meeting was shifted to the Maxim Gorky because gale-force winds would have made launch transfers treacherous. The White House said `` there was no danger to anyone aboard <PERSON> Belknap </PERSON> as a result of the high winds.'' The 630-foot <PERSON> Maxim </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorky </PERSON> is about twice as large as the Slava in total tonnage. Built 20 years ago in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, it was sold to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in 1974 and is used frequently for cruises through the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> and Scandanavian waters. The vessel was repaired after it rammed an iceberg off <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> last June with 900 people aboard, but there were no injuries. The two leaders are scheduled to meet Sunday aboard the <PERSON> Belknap </PERSON>, flagship of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sixth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fleet </ORGANIZATION> which is anchored about 400 yards from the Slava.

<TEXT>
 Fourteen-year-old <PERSON> Mamta </PERSON>, who lost her parents and five brothers and sisters in the deadly gas leak at <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION>'s pesticide plant here, tried to commit suicide two weeks ago by setting fire to her house. She was rescued by neighbors and sent to an orphanage in another town. Many of the more than 20,000 survivors of the world's worst industrial accident share <ORGANIZATION> Mamta </ORGANIZATION>'s despair, and five years later they still have not been compensated. They have trouble finding work because their eyes and lungs were damaged by exposure to the white cloud of methyl isocyanate that passed over their crowded shantytowns on Dec. 3, 1984. Instead, they wait for their shares of the $ 470 million the U.S.-based multinational <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION> gave the Indian government in `` full and final compensation'' of the disaster that has killed at least 3,598 people. The government alleged the leak was the result of negligence by <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION> and sued it for $ 3 billion. Union Carbide said the leak was sabotage by a disgruntled employee. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ultimately approved <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 470 million compensation, but many survivors bitterly contest the settlement as much too small. The government's right to agree to the settlement as the sole representative of the survivors has been challenged, delaying disbursement of most of the money. Meanwhile, the deaths continue. At least 269 people have died in the past year of ailments blamed on exposure to the gas. S.R. <ORGANIZATION> Satyam </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> Madhya </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pradesh </LOCATION> state government's commissioner for gas relief, says 1,960 deaths await investigation. The government still has not reviewed all of the approximately 570,000 compensation claims. Some of the seekers were hundreds of miles from <LOCATION> Bhopal </LOCATION> at the time of the leak but say they suffered mental anguish worrying about the fates of loved ones. A survey by a team of doctors found that 70 percent of the people who inhaled the gas still suffer from severe respiratory disorders, chronic eye diseases, cataracts, menstrual problems and neurological disorders. The government's figures of the permanantly disabled are `` grossly underestimated,'' the team's spokesman, Dr. <PERSON> Nishith </PERSON> <PERSON> Vohra </PERSON>, told reporters Friday in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>. Dr. <PERSON> Gurbaksh </PERSON> <PERSON> Rai </PERSON> <PERSON> Dheer </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Bhopal </LOCATION>'s chief medical officer, said there is no known treatment for the gas. `` Our treatment is symptomatic. This has helped some of the victims to recover, but many are showing no signs of improvement,'' he said. He said psychological disorders resulting from trauma are also common. <ORGANIZATION> Satyam </ORGANIZATION> cites <PERSON> Mamta </PERSON>, who tried to burn herself to death by setting fire to the family home. Her brother, <PERSON> Sunil </PERSON> <PERSON> Vishwakarma </PERSON>, 17, now sits brooding with his dog, <PERSON> Moti </PERSON>, in the tin-roofed house, across the road from the closed Union Carbide plant. The Indian government has spent millions of rupees on relief and rehabilitation, but survivors say the measures are inadequate. `` The government began with dole of money, grains and milk,'' said <PERSON> Shankarlal </PERSON> <PERSON> Shrivastava </PERSON>, a grocer. But now, all assistance has stopped, he said. `` We can not exert ourselves because of breathing problems, and it is difficult to find a job suited to our physical capability,'' he said. Activist groups call the $ 470 million settlement `` grossly inadequate'' and organized demonstrations for more compensation after it was announced. Protests have become rare. `` It is becoming increasingly clear that the amount will not be raised any further,'' said <PERSON> Alok </PERSON> <PERSON> Pratap </PERSON> <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, who heads the <ORGANIZATION> Poisonous </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Episode </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Struggle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Satinath </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarangi </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Bhopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> said the low compensation was offered because multinational companies feel `` life in the Third World -LRB- is -RRB- cheap.'' `` All we want now is that the charges of homicide against the company should not be dropped and its officials should be prosecuted,'' he said. `` How can we allow this killer company to be exonerated from the charge of killing our family members and making our lives miserable,'' said <PERSON> Razia </PERSON> <PERSON> Bee </PERSON>, 40, whose husband and two daughters died in the gas leak. `` I just feel like dropping a bomb on the factory, but I fear there are still poisonous gases inside,'' she said. <PERSON> Narmada </PERSON> <PERSON> Bai </PERSON> <PERSON> Rajoria </PERSON>, another widow, said the victims want jobs, not alms. She said she returned an early, stopgap award of $ 625, which was given by the government as compensation for her husband's death `` I want employment so that I can support my family and live with dignity,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Rajoria </PERSON> said.

 Winds gusting to 48 miles per hour and roiling seas moved the first summit session between President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to a Soviet luxury liner and delayed the second round of meetings. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> met this morning on the 25,000-ton liner Maxim Gorky after gale-force winds caused both the Soviet ship Slava, the original site of today's meeting, and the USS Belknap to drag their anchors. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> returned to <PERSON> Belknap </PERSON> after five hours of talks and was to return to the Gorky for an afternoon summit session. But the White House said the weather forced a delay in that second session. This morning, the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> issued a statement saying that the winds, which built overnight, `` make it difficult to disembark from launches at the Slava and the <PERSON> Belknap </PERSON>. Therefore, this morning's meeting has been shifted to the Soviet ship Gorky at anchor at <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION>. Maltese meteorologist <PERSON> Spiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Agius </PERSON> said the winds should abate by Sunday, the final day of the summit. `` It will definitely be improving tomorrow,'' he said. Despite a little pitching from the heavy seas, the winds did not present a danger to anyone on the <PERSON> Belknap </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s headquarters for the summit and the site of his wrap-up meeting on Sunday with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, the White House statement said. In fact, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who slept aboard the Belknap Friday night, said on the <PERSON> Gorky </PERSON> that he was `` feeling pretty good.'' Asked how he slept, he said, `` fine, just fine ... piece of cake.'' The stormy conditions prompted <PERSON> Raisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to delay a sightseeing tour, but she later went ahead with the visit, including an inspection of a 16th-century cathedral. `` This is the type of weather that shipwrecked Saint <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> on these rocks. We usually have this in February,'' <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Cassar </PERSON>, Maltese minister for housing, told a rain-soaked crowd that had gathered to see the Soviet leader's wife at <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lucia </LOCATION>, a suburb of <LOCATION> Valletta </LOCATION>, the capital city. Both the 12,500-ton Slava and 8,600-ton <PERSON> Belknap </PERSON> are anchored in the middle of the Bay, while the much larger Gorky, which has been <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s base during his time in <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION>, is tied up at a pier. The high winds were blowing from the northeast. <PERSON> Marsaxlokk </PERSON> <PERSON> Bay </PERSON>, a large indentation in the southeast coast of <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION>, is exposed to winds from easterly directions. The hasty change in plans for the superpower meeting in the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> came as the tiny wind-whipped island nation was as ready as it would ever be for its weekend in the international limelight. <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> was hoping the summit would boost attention for the island, but the bad weather probably was not the type of publicity the Maltese had in mind. On shore, red Soviet flags flapped in the stiff breeze. On Friday, street salesmen were out in force to hawk commemorative T-shirts and other souvenir and residents strolled to the edge of <LOCATION> Marsaxlokk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> for a look at the two anchored warships. `` This may help your tourism,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had told Prime Minister <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Fenech-Adami </PERSON> on Friday following his arrival from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` It will probably bring positive economic effects,'' said a 21-year-old woman who identified herself only as <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON>, assessing the summit's meaning for the 350,000 Maltese. She and two companions had come out Friday night for a glimpse of the warships. `` We were bored,'' she admitted. On the other side of the bay, in the fishing village of <LOCATION> Birzebuga </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> led a group of <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> workers preparing for a peace demonstration timed to coincide with the summit, decorating a float that will be a part of a 60-piece parade on Saturday. `` Give peace a chance,'' said signs on the float in both English and Russian. Although <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> were unlikely to see the parade itself, <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> said: `` <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> is ready to show to the world that we hope for peace.'' Traffic circles and seaside roads were decorated with Soviet and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> flags, and Maltese security forces stood through the night in clumps of two or three on streets overlooking the harbor. <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION>'s entire 1,200-man military and most of its 1,000 police officers have been assigned to the summit security job. Roadblocks and checkpoints made it hard to get around on the narrow island roads, although it seemed anyone with a good story could get waved through. Although thousands of Maltese had skipped work or classes to catch a glimpse of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s arrival early Friday, most were already in bed by the time <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s Il-62 rolled up to the airport gangway at 11 p.m. sharp during a gentle mist. The prime minister and his cabinet broke from their line and walked over to the plane's gangplank as Sgt. <PERSON> Emmanuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Gatt </PERSON>, a 32-veteran of the Maltese army, and two other soldiers rolled out a red carpet for <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and his wife <PERSON> Raisa </PERSON>, who walked arm-in-arm down the steps. After a 21-gun salute, a Maltese armed forces band in dark blue uniforms with red piping on their pants played the Soviet and Maltese national anthems. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> thanked <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> for preparing the summit for him and President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` Although we will be meeting on naval ships, I would like to assure you that we will be speaking about peace, about how we can work for a better world,'' he said.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Chin </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON>, one of the world's longest-surviving and most secretive Communist guerrilla leaders, laid down his arms Saturday after a half-century of jungle warfare And the insurgency he started with the killing of three British rubber planters 41 years ago in what is now <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION> has formally ended in a southern <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> city known more for its sex trade than politics. Now in his late 60s, <PERSON> Chin </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> signed an agreement ending the armed struggle of the Communist Party of <LOCATION> Malaya </LOCATION>, which has within its much-withered ranks some 1,200 weary jungle fighters who are to return to civilian life. The Communists agreed to lay down their arms and pledged loyalty to king and country. <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION> promised to ensure their fair treatment. The signing ceremony at <LOCATION> Hat </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yai </LOCATION>, a bustling center attracting thousands of tourists and smuggled goods from nearby <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>, marked another failure of communist effort around the world. <PERSON> Chin </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> called the agreements `` consistent with the current historical trend where the peoples of the whole world are striving for peace and democracy.'' <PERSON> Chin </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON>'s future appears uncertain. Some Malaysian officials have expressed suspicion of his motives, and the country appears unwilling to accept ex-guerrillas once officially known as CTs, or Communist Terrorists, who sought power through the barrel of a gun. Dubbed `` the world's senior surviving guerrilla'' by one Western expert, <PERSON> Chin </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> belongs to a now all but vanished breed who fought to create a <ORGANIZATION> Marxist-Leninist </ORGANIZATION> order following the chaos of World War II. In World War II, the young <PERSON> Chin </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> was a courageous, behind-enemy-lines fighter against the Japanese, learning guerrilla tactics from his British comrades-at-arms in the jungles of <LOCATION> Malaya </LOCATION>, formerly a British colony and now a part of <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>. He also became a committed Communist. `` Unusual ability, an incisive brain, reliable, a frank man -LRB- who -RRB- possessed marked courage, and commanded the natural respect of men without fuss or formality,'' one of the British officers, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, said of him. He was awarded the Order of the British Empire after the war. Soon, however, he became secretary-general of the Communist Party. He was born in 1920 or 1922 in <LOCATION> Malaya </LOCATION>'s Perak State of Chinese parents who immigrated to <LOCATION> Malaya </LOCATION> shortly before his birth. His father made a good living selling and repairing bicycles and sent his son to local English schools where he excelled. The Chinese were in many respects an underprivileged class in British-ruled <LOCATION> Malaya </LOCATION>, and for a number of young people among them, communism represented social justice and a shortcut to power and status. In 1948 the party decided to wage armed struggle, the opening volleys of which were fired June 16 when guerrillas walked into two rubber plantations in northern <LOCATION> Malaya </LOCATION> and methodically executed three planters. The country was plunged into 12 years of violence known as the Malayan Emergency. It became one of the few successful efforts by a government to stamp out a communist insurgency within its borders. Later, in the Vietnam War, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government sought advice from some of the architects of the victory, but conditions were far different in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s war. At the height of the Emergency, some 70,000 British, Australian, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>, Fijian, Gurkha and other British <ORGANIZATION> Commonwealth </ORGANIZATION> troops fought about 10,000 guerrillas. More than 10,000 fighters and civilians died between 1948 and 1960. Although the casualties were relatively light, the jungle fighting was agonizing and the communist attacks vicious. Tens of thousands of often innocent Chinese were uprooted as a result of the ultimately successful strategy to separate the guerrillas from all sources of support. Clearly losing, <PERSON> Chin </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> emerged from the jungle in 1955 to negotiate with Malayan officials at a schoolhouse near the Thai-Malay border. <PERSON> Tunku </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Rahman </PERSON>, shortly to become prime minister of an independent <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>, insisted on surrender and an amnesty. But <PERSON> Chin </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> wanted his party included in a coalition government and the talks broke down. `` The amnesty means surrender, surrender means humiliation. We will not accept surrender at any time,'' <PERSON> Chin </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> said. `` If you demand our surrender, we would prefer to fight to the last man.'' <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, his wartime friend, was present and the two men shook hands before <PERSON> Chin </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> disappeared into the jungle. It was the last time he was seen by the non-communist world until his recent emergence in <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, which brokered the agreement. Although the Emergency was declared over in 1960, communist attacks continued. Their last major raids were in the mid-1970s, when guerrillas blew up the National War Memorial in <LOCATION> Kuala </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lumpur </LOCATION>. Thereafter, communist strength was sapped through joint Thai-Malaysian military operations and a <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> amnesty that saw mass surrenders in recent years. <PERSON> Chin </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> reportedly spent most of his time in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, making periodic trips to the rugged Thai-Malaysian border where the Malayan Communists were largely concentrated. There also were reports of his death. <PERSON> Chin </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> became a legendary figure, the ruthlessness of his movement mingling with the personal respect he had elicited from his enemies. C.C. Too, the onetime <LOCATION> Malaysian </LOCATION> psychological warfare chief who matched wits with him, described <PERSON> Chin </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> in a 1976 interview as having `` a scholarly, monastic quality. When he talked and acted, it was with dignity. `` If there is a Communist who can be called gentlemanly it was <PERSON> Chin </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON>,'' he said.

<HEAD>New Democratic Group Claims Inspiration from Hart, McCarthy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEVEN L. HERMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A fledgling faction of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> is organizing under the title `` New Democrats'' with plans to promote liberal candidates in coming elections. The group claims the support of former presidential candidates <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> in its self-declared mission of wresting control of the party from `` political managers, technocrats and media consultants.'' <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>, whose early success in the 1968 Democratic primaries led President <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> to abandon his re-election bid, has accepted the position of director of the New Democrats' steering committee. He said he hopes the group can help counter the notion that wearing a liberal tag is a political liability. Democrats, not the Republicans, must shoulder the blame for liberalism's evolution into the dreaded `` L word'' of the last presidential campaign, the former <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> senator said in an interview. `` Gradually the word began to take on the characteristic of a noun. At that point it was subject to all kinds of attacks by the conservatives,'' <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> said. `` But then in the 80s, liberals began to attack liberalism and admit that it had these serious faults. I think -LRB- <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> said he was a sane liberal _ the implication being that all other liberals were insane.'' <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>, a former <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> senator and frontrunner in the 1988 presidential campaign until a furor over his private life sabotaged his standing, has given his blessing to the movement but declined a leadership position, the New Democrats say. The group's founder, <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Yoder </PERSON>, is a philosophy professor at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lowell </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> who worked in <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>'s 1968 campaign He said the group plans to field its first candidates for political office in 1990, including congressional races. Philadelphia-area political activist and sports handicapper <PERSON> Darcy </PERSON> <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> said he intends in January to become the first congressional candidate to run as a New Democrat. `` I think the New Democrats label will draw some attention. It'll make people look twice and at least give us a hearing,'' said <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>, who has his eye set on <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>'s 13th congressional district seat currently held by Republican <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Coughlin </PERSON>. The New Democrats will try to unite the <LOCATION> Woodstock </LOCATION> generation with the younger one politically weaned on Reaganomics, <PERSON> Yoder </PERSON> said. The group's positions include rolling back tax breaks for the wealthy, immediate reductions in automotive and industrial pollution levels, and higher pay for teachers. `` People who were around in'68 are now the decision makers today and I think those are the people we will appeal to, but of course we'll also be appealing to new people _ the students and others within the party who see the merit of emphasizing the envirnment, the economy and education,'' <PERSON> Yoder </PERSON> said. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Thurber </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> and Presidential Studies at <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, is among the skeptics who say the new group is unlikely to ever put a Democrat in the White House. Any faction trying to rescue the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> should be appealing to southern conservatives such as Sens. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Robb </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, not liberals, he said. `` They will not be able to pull from the South. If you can not pull from the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>, you lose the election,'' <PERSON> Thurber </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, who has won acquittals for many white collar defendants, is known as a tough but fair negotiator with a quick grasp of legal issues. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> may have had that reputation in mind when it chose the 50-year-old <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> to look into the case of five senators under fire for their role in the $ 2 billion <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> and Loan controversy. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, whose office overlooks <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> Avenue five blocks from the White House, was chosen by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Select </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Ethics as its special counsel in the case of the so-called `` Keating Five.'' He will provide legal advice on whether any or all of the five senators violated the rules when they met with banking regulators on behalf of wealthy campaign donor <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> in 1987. At the time, <PERSON> Keating </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> and Loan of <LOCATION> Irvine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION> was collapsing and its failure is now expected to cost taxpayers $ 2 billion. The brother of national drug policy coordinator <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, stocky, animated <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> is described by fellow lawyers as a tough negotiator who can quickly grasp complex legal issues. `` If I were one of the senators and had done nothing wrong, I would n't worry,'' said attorney <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Barcella </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> `` But if I were one of the senators and had something to worry about, I'd be scared to death.'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>'s role is to advise the committee on whether to launch a formal investigation of the five: <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>, D-Calif.; <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, D-Mich.; <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>; <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCain </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ariz </LOCATION>.; and <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ariz </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Keating </PERSON> had contributed some $ 1.3 million to the senators' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>'s role could become even more powerful if the panel proceeds with a full-scale investigation and invites him to remain. For <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, that would not be a first-time experience. He was the panel's counsel in the Abscam bribery case against former Sen. <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, D-N.J. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> resigned in 1982. In his report, <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said the senator's behavior was `` illegal, corrupt and unethical.'' <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, four years younger than his brother, said, `` When <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> got you in a headlock, that was it _ you did n't get out. The thing is concentration. His brain is like a radar screen. When <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> sizes up the topic, nothing interferes.'' The president's drug coordinator recalls that he once was roughed up by a neighborhood bully when he was about five. `` Bob went to the kid's house and when the mother answered the door, he was very polite,'' <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said. `` But when the boy came to the door, <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> said, ` This is for hitting my brother. He decked him in the doorway. That's classic <PERSON> Bob </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>'s whose 55-member law firm has one of the nation's largest law practices representing white collar defendants Current and former clients include former <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehman </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>; four defense contractors in the Pentagon bribery scandal known as Operation Ill Wind and the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> diGenova </PERSON>, the former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney for the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, praised <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>'s appointment `` He can look at something and smell it and know when something's wrong,'' said <PERSON> DiGenova </PERSON>. `` He's the kind of guy who has judgment.

<HEAD>Police Close Art Show Sponsored by Foreign Journalists</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Police Saturday shut down an exhibition of paintings by young Chinese artists sponsored by foreign journalists, saying the exhibitors failed to obtain permission from the government. Police also said the one-day show was `` activity incompatible with your status as journalists,'' said <PERSON> Jaime </PERSON> <PERSON> Florcruz </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correspondents </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Florcruz </PERSON>, a reporter for <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> magazine </ORGANIZATION>, said three uniformed police officers and a plainclothes officer gave the artists 40 minutes to remove their oil paintings from a room at the Great Wall Sheraton, a U.S.-China joint venture hotel. The Correspondents Club was allowed to hold a show in 1988 at the hotel as a way for journalists to meet young artists. However, freedom of expression for artists, writers and others has been strictly limited since the June crackdown on the pro-democracy movement here. `` Everyone is just flexing their muscles during martial law,'' said <PERSON> Meg </PERSON> <PERSON> Maggio </PERSON>, also a Time staffer and the organizer of Saturday's exhibition of 40 works by six artists. She said police `` never looked at the paintings.'' Many were avant-garde or abstract but did not appear to carry political messages. Ms. <PERSON> Maggio </PERSON> said she was aware that under martial law, in effect in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> since May, the club needed authorization for the exhibit. But, she said, `` there is no procedure. We did n't know how to get permission.'' <PERSON> Florcruz </PERSON> said he called the <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> on Friday but was not told how to obtain the needed authorization. He said he told police the paintings were not for sale and there would be no commercial activity at the exhibit. The police responded, `` There's no room for discussion,'' he said. In November, the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Culture </ORGANIZATION> forced the <ORGANIZATION> French </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> to cancel a nine-day exhibit of the works of a 28-year-old Chinese artist. `` We were told that foreign embassies are not allowed to sponsor exhibitions by artists _ whether singers, painters, whatever,'' a <ORGANIZATION> French </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> official said on condition of anonymity. Culture Ministry officials told French diplomats at the time that the ministry planned to distribute a circular informing embassies of the policy. Several embassies said they had not received such a notice. Since the military marched on <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> June 3-4 and crushed the student-led pro-democracy movement, writers have been told they must discard `` bourgeois liberal tendencies'' and produce works in support of socialist ideas. Film directors who had done works about the darker aspects of life in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> have stopped directing or have returned to government-sanctioned films. Most of the young artists who a year ago astonished the nation with the first public shows of nude and avant-garde works have gone underground. Artists can earn little or no money for their works domestically and those who once sought foreign buyers have been censured. The official <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> on Saturday criticized some art stores and individuals who `` manage artwork sales without licenses, doing illicit trade in black markets or profiteering through underground channels.''

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, stranded by high winds and choppy seas aboard an American naval cruiser, canceled his second round of summit talks and a dinner Saturday with Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, White House officials announced. The summit was to resume on Sunday. Putting a sunny spin on a rain splattered day, the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> said, `` We feel this has been a very productive day in terms of the five-hour meeting this morning.'' There was no immediate word from the Soviet delegation. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> had held five hours of talks earlier in the day before <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> returned to his ship to prepare for the second round and the dinner, which originally was supposed to have been aboard the president's command ship, the <PERSON> Belknap </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was unable to cross 500 yards of roiling waters to reach <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, resting on a luxurious Soviet cruise liner tied up at shore. A White House statement, making fun of the frustration, said, `` The 60 miles per hour winds preclude any movements off the ship this evening, but they have made for a very exciting afternoon sail.'' Stranded on the <PERSON> Belknap </PERSON> along with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> were Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON>, the president's national security adviser, and <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, the president's press secretary. The meeting on ships in the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> had been <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s idea for the beginning, but the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> tried to share any embarrassment with the Soviets. `` We are disappointed that the Soviet delegation was unable to join us for dinner on <PERSON> Belknap </PERSON> due to the storm,'' the statement said, adding that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials look forward to Sunday's scheduled meeting. `` We also regret that we were unable to visit the Slava for this afternoon's meeting,'' it added. The Slava, a Soviet naval cruiser, was to have been the site for Saturday's meeting, but the talks were moved to a Soviet cruise liner docked at the shore. Stating the obvious, the statement said that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and his delegation would remain on the <PERSON> Belknap </PERSON> for the night. `` We expect Sunday's schedule to be maintained as orginally planned,'' it said.

<HEAD>After Six Months, Foley Has Imposed Leadership Style on House</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Through the upheaval of Democratic leadership, the fight with the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> over capital gains and the end-of-session pay raise, <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> has been able to maintain his dry sense of humor. During his last daily news conference before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> adjourned last month, the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Democrat took note of the first live telecast of the proceedings of the British <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commons </ORGANIZATION>. `` I know you're going to think they are much more witty and much more stimulating in every way,'' <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, an ardent admirer of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s parliamentary system, said of his British counterparts. `` What I understand from reading the paper is that British television consultants have been suggesting that they behave like <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> congressmen, which will make it a dull place, indeed, over there if they do.'' <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> went on to say that the speaker of the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commons </ORGANIZATION> recently asked him what number speaker he was. `` I said I was the 49th,'' <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> said. `` He said he was the 634th. They generally date the speakership from 1377. `` And I said, ` Well, that's what we call a putdown in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, Mr. Speaker.' `` And he said, `` Well, eight of them were beheaded, two of them on the same day.''' After six months as speaker, <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> also has been able to impose his leadership style on a House that was soured by deep, partisan divisions that climaxed in the resignation of former Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> has preached the doctrine of cooperation, not confrontation, and reduced the bitterness and tension by working closely with <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> leaders to create an atmosphere in which policy differences, rather than personal or partisan differences, dominate the debate. As the first session of the 101st <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> ground to a close, <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Minority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> introduced a resolution thanking <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> for the `` able, impartial and dignified manner'' in which he had run the House. `` Part of the achievement has been getting the focus of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> back on the legislative agenda,'' <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> said in an interview. `` I do n't accept the notion that Democrats should be confrontational and resist everything the administration does.'' Despite lingering grumblings from some Democrats that <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> needs to be more combative, the speaker said he has no intention of changing his approach. `` I am not a basher,'' <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> said. `` Just to be an opponent of the president every day of the week because I'm a Democrat and he's a Republican is not what I think the public had in mind ... That does n't mean we will be a Greek chorus of background for the administration.'' <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> gave the first session of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> a grade of B, pointing with pride to legislation bailing out the savings and loan industry, raising the minimum wage, increasing funding for the war on drugs and overhauling existing oil spill liability laws. <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> also defended the pay increase, which was coupled with what he called the `` most important'' ethics reforms since 1977. `` I do n't fool myself that this is always the most popular legislation with the public,'' <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> said of the pay raise. <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> said he was disappointed there was no final action on child care legislation and that both <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the administration `` wasted time and energy'' on an `` ill-timed, ill-conceived'' proposal to cut capital gains taxes. He said that how the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> reacts to the easing of tensions with the <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> bloc and `` carve up the peace dividend'' if the defense budget is cut will be top priority issues for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> next year. But he said it was `` premature'' to talk about deep cuts in the defense budget. The speaker said he too was caught off guard by the rapid pace of the developments in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and it is hard to `` contemplate where it will lead. It is premature to say the Cold War is over.'' <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> did not rule out the possibility of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> committing `` money and resources'' to furthering the opening of <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and suggested that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> may have to approve `` credits for food and fuel'' to prop up the Soviet economy through the winter.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, meeting at a storm-curtailed summit, discussed the political upheaval in in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> on Saturday and vowed to respond to events with `` with sensitivity and firm initiative,'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said. After five hours of talks that began with handshakes and smiles between the two leaders, a White House statement said the meetings `` were marked by a spirit of forward-looking cooperation during these increasingly changing times.'' But gale-force winds and roiling seas forced cancellation of afternoon talks and a scheduled dinner. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was unable to leave the USS <PERSON> Belknap </PERSON> and cross 500 yards of <LOCATION> Meditereanean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> to reach <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, resting on a luxurious Soviet cruise liner tied up at shore. Both sides said the reason for the change in schedule was the weather. Referring to the talks held before weather intervened, <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON>, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s spokesman, said `` things went well. They talked about everything, arms, <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, philosphical questions.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> opened the morning meeting with an hour-long presentation, proposing more than a dozen ideas for economic and political progress in U.S.-Soviet relations, the White House statement said, without elaboration. It said the talks ranged from the economic situation in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> to arms control and <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, and added that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> spoke at length about perestroika, his program of economic restructuring, and the goals of his reform program. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> stressed there was `` no other reason'' for the change in schedule except the weather. A White House statement said, `` The 60 miles per hour winds preclude any movements off the ship this evening, but they have made for a very exciting afternoon sail.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> had been scheduled to wrap up their talks on Sunday, and the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> said `` we expect'' that to be the case. The weather aside, the White House assessment of the talks was upbeat. `` We feel this has been a very productive day in terms of the five hour meeting this morning,'' said the White House. `` I think we've got a very good beginning of the dialogue ... an excellent beginning,'' Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> told reporters after <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> completed their initial session. `` They recognized that economic and political challenges were ahead for <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, and voewed to consider the opportunities presented with sensitivity and firm initiative,'' said the statement issued later. `` The first thing to do is eliminate those types of ships which you can not board in this kind of weather,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> joked to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as he welcomed him aboard. `` We will have a secret agenda in this way to disarm the -LRB- <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> -RRB- Sixth Fleet,'' the Soviet leader said with a laugh. The Soviets are serious, however, in pressing the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to agree to reductions in naval forces as part of arms control negotiations and to remove nuclear weapons from the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> zone. As the small talk ended, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` Let's go to work.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> braved the choppy seas in a small launch to get to the Soviet liner, and then ran into trouble when he returned to his command ship, the cruiser USS Belknap, also anchored about 500 yards from land. His launch had to make four passes at the <PERSON> Belknap </PERSON> before he could board. The White House sought to minimize the effect the bad weather was having on the summit and put an upbeat spin on the talks, saying that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> thought the talks were `` extremely productive.'' Senior Soviet officials said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> wants the summit to produce a timetable for completing U.S.-Soviet treaties on reducing strategic nuclear weapons, conventional forces in central <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and chemical weapons. These officials, who spoke only on condition they not be identified, said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> will convene a meeting of <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact leaders in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> on Monday to discuss the results of the two-day summit. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will spend Monday briefing allied leaders at <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> were smiling and in high spirits as they clasped hands across a long rectangular table, measuring barely a yard across. `` It's so narrow that if we do n't have enough arguments, we'll kick each other,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> told <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> Asked by reporters if they would reach make any achievements, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> replied, `` da, da -LRB- yes, yes -RRB-.'' On what? he was asked. `` Mnogovo,'' which was translated as meaning `` a lot of things.'' When <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was asked the same question, the president echoed <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. `` Mnogovo,'' he said. The two leaders met in the plush surroundings of a library-like room known as the Card Room, next to the ship's lounge and nightclub, on the Maxim Gorky's promenade deck. They sat in deep captain's chairs, accompanied by aides on either side. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who had spent the night on the storm-buffeted <PERSON> Belknap </PERSON>, said he had not been bothered by the rough weather. `` Piece of cake,'' he said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> held three rounds of talks that the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> said amounted to almost continuous discussions between 10:05 a.m. until 3 p.m. They began with an expanded meeting that included at least 16 people and then held a one-on-one session, with notetakers, that lasted about 1 -LCB- hours. That was followed by a working lunch, after which <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> returned to the Belknap for some private time. The rain and wind disrupted <PERSON> Raisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s sightseeing plans. She at first canceled plans to visit a 16th Century cathedral, choosing to remain aboard the Gorky, but then later went ahead with the tour. First lady <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did not accompany <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION>.

 American consumers are likely to see broad changes in the way they do business with their bankers and investment firms in the early 1990s. That was the prospect raised Friday when Wall Street's main trade group, the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, proposed a radical revamping of the 56-year-old law that defines what distinct services banks and brokers can offer. That law, the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933, is designed to guard against conflicts of interest and threats to financial stability by, for example, keeping a safe distance between bank deposits and risky investments like stocks. But in recent years financial deregulation in this country and increasing international competition have been steadily chipping away at Glass-Steagall. Banks have entered the securities business, such as by opening discount brokerage offices and selling mutual funds. Brokers have encroached on bankers' turf by creating `` central assets accounts'' that are not federally insured, but feature check-writing and credit cards. Late Friday the <ORGANIZATION> SIA </ORGANIZATION> endorsed a proposal to scrap Glass-Steagall and rebuild it from the ground up. This approach could result in new services being available at banks or investment firms, and it conceivably could wipe out some changes consumers have grown used to in recent years. `` The critical question is not whether there will be a Glass-Steagall in the future, but what will replace it,'' <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Breeden </PERSON>, the chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, said Saturday. Proponents of the change stress that they want to keep federally insured deposits separate from investments and securities deals that are exposed to market risks. But they do envision single corporate entities, formed perhaps through mergers, with separate subsidiaries overseen by separate regulators that would offer banking and brokerage services. Advocates of the change say American financial companies of all kinds need a new framework to compete with foreign financial institutions of increasing size and strength, with a growing presence in this country. Treasury Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> said of the <ORGANIZATION> SIA </ORGANIZATION> initiative, `` I think that's appropriate, particularly from an international perspective.'' Many interested parties are still to be heard from on the proposal, including the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> and the banking industry. And for the proposal to become reality, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would have to take a new look at the issue when it reconvenes next year. `` We recognize how complex these matters are and that they will take time to work out,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Downey </PERSON>, a partner at the prominent Wall Street firm of <ORGANIZATION> Goldman </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sachs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, who took over Friday as the <ORGANIZATION> SIA </ORGANIZATION>'s chairman for the next year. `` Our nation's banks and securities firms need to be ready to compete internationally. But we must avoid precipitating huge new risks for the federal deposit insurance system. `` We do not want a repeat of the $ 160 billion bailout of the thrift industry.''

<TEXT>
 The Solar Maximum satellite, a scientific window to the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>, the sun and even distant stars for nearly 10 years, plunged to its fiery destruction Saturday in the atmosphere over the <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION>. Capt. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Niemann </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, said the satellite re-entered the Earth's protective atmosphere at about 5:26 a.m. EST, and broke up in what likely was a 500-mile-long path of burning debris over the <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION>, roughly halfway between the coasts of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> <PERSON> Niemann </PERSON> said there were no reported sightings of the plunge of Solar Max, which occurred during afternoon hours in that part of the world. A re-entry at night could have produced a spectacular fireworks display visible for hundreds of miles. There was speculation that a chunk of the satellite, involving an inch-thick titanium plate about 5 feet high by 4 feet wide, might survive the searing journey through the atmosphere. But `` If it did, it's at the bottom of the <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Niemann </PERSON> said. `` I think we've heard the last of Solar Max.'' The Solar <PERSON> Max </PERSON>, once given new life by the ill-fated space shuttle Challenger, succumbed to its decaying orbit after a research odyssey in which it traveled 1.4 billion miles, in an orbit which normally ranged 300 miles from <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. Launched in February 1980, <PERSON> Solar </PERSON> <PERSON> Max </PERSON> was the first satellite designed to be retrieved by a space shuttle crew. That came in handy in 1984, when the shuttle Challenger drew alongside, brought the satellite into the cargo bay, replaced a failed electronics box and sent Solar Max back on its way. That was the first satellite repair mission in space. A month later, Solar <PERSON> Max </PERSON> recorded one of the largest flare eruptions ever seen on the sun. Other achievements in Solar <PERSON> Max </PERSON>'s career: _ In 1987, its gamma ray spectrometer was the first instrument to detect rays from Supernova 1987a, a distant star that exploded in a neighboring galaxy, the Magellanic Cloud _ It detected 10 comets colliding with the sun, the latest on Sept. 28 _ Its ultraviolet spectrometer detected increases in high-altitude ozone levels around the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> just north of the <LOCATION> equator </LOCATION>, and decreases just south of the equator _ It recorded more than 12,500 solar flares _ powerful eruptions on the sun, and made it possible for scientists to measure sunspot magnetic fields above the visible surface of the sun for the first time The satellite orbited at an altitude of 300 miles originally and maintained its position with spinning wheels and magnetic torque bars. But as Solar <PERSON> Max </PERSON> traveled 1.4 billion miles, its altitude gradually lowered, until it was subjected to intense heat from friction with thicker air. There was no way to boost it to a higher orbit without help from another shuttle, and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> said it could not fit such a $ 25 million rescue mission into the shuttle schedule. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Douds </PERSON>, deputy project manager for satellite servicing missions at the <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Goddard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flight </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, said the public got its money's worth from the $ 77 million satellite. `` It provided a real window into the dynamics of solar activity and total output of the sun,'' <PERSON> Douds </PERSON> said. Originally, the Space Command had predicted the satellite would smash into the atmosphere at 6:12 a.m. EST over the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION>, and west of the <LOCATION> Galapagos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>. But it had cautioned that the projection could be far off the mark, because of variables such as the satellite's attitude at re-entry and waves in the upper atmosphere. All along, experts had said the chances of fragments hitting a populated area were remote. More than 80 percent of Solar <PERSON> Max </PERSON>'s orbital path was over water In the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, only <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> and extreme south <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and south <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> were on its track.

 When <PERSON> Vitalija </PERSON> <PERSON> Keblys </PERSON> left her home in 1945 just ahead of invading Russian troops, she never dreamed she would be invited back to her native land to be honored as the poet laureate of <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>. But that's what happened when the high school chemistry teacher became the 20th person, the fourth woman and the only `` foreigner'' to hold the honor in <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>, once an independent country but under Soviet domination since World War II. `` I was born in <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>, but we left when the Russians were coming, and now I am an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> citizen, so I am really a foreigner in my native land,'' she said. `` We left on foot,'' she continued. `` We just walked away. The Russians were only half a mile away, and as we left we could see them. We went to <LOCATION> Dresden </LOCATION> and lived through the <LOCATION> Dresden </LOCATION> firebombing. `` I came to the states with $ 2 in my pocket. I was 15 years old, and a friend of mine had sent me the money.'' The young immigrant arrived in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> as a sophomore in high school but went to work in a factory and finished high school in summers and evenings in just over a year. She studied chemistry because she knew mathematics but not English. `` I was in a Shakespeare course, and I could memorize it but did n't know what it meant,'' she said in a recent interview. `` I was n't going to stay in the factory, so I worked and went to school at Notre Dame of <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> and got my master's in chemistry education.'' <PERSON> Keblys </PERSON>, 55, kept writing all her life _ in <LOCATION> Lithuanian </LOCATION>. `` I was a poet before I was a chemist,'' she said. `` I never write in English because I do n't have the command of the language. It has to be your mother tongue. I'm strictly a Lithuanian poet. I teach in English and write in Lithuanian.'' <PERSON> Keblys </PERSON> met her husband, <PERSON> Kestutis </PERSON> <PERSON> Keblys </PERSON>, at a <LOCATION> Lithuanian </LOCATION> college student meeting in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The two discovered they had lived in villages some 20 miles apart and had left at about the same time to spend much of their childhood in refugee camps, then came to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and on to college. All of <PERSON> Keblys </PERSON>' work has been published in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, except her last book of poetry, `` Kelione'' -LRB- `` A Journey'' -RRB-, which was published in <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>. She writes under her maiden name, <PERSON> Vitalija </PERSON> <PERSON> Bogutaite </PERSON>. Her husband describes her poetry as `` not nationalistic in a direct way. But in a symbolic way she brings out concerns about national survival and the oppression of the war years.'' A few of her poems have been translated, and `` Ode Laikue'' -LRB- Ode to Time -RRB- reveals some of her attachment to her native country: `` When you will tear and divide the steaming loaf of rye remember that it too swayed and ripened in the fields of my homeland.'' <PERSON> Keblys </PERSON> went to <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION> two years ago and again this year to participate in the festival, an event that draws crowds comparable to football-game crowds in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. This summer she went with her husband to the festival and did n't know she had won the prize until she arrived Its 500-ruble prize _ worth about $ 350 at the time _ was about what a <LOCATION> Lithuanian </LOCATION> doctor would earn in three months, she said. `` I did n't expect to get the prize,'' she said Saturday. `` I just went to sit in and celebrate with them at the poetry festival. When I got off the plane in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, I was told I won the prize. As long as it was n't the <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON> prize, it was fine by me.'' In <LOCATION> Baton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rouge </LOCATION>, she teaches honors and advanced placement chemistry at <ORGANIZATION> Scotlandville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Magnet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. Her husband, a chemist for the <ORGANIZATION> Ethyl </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, also teaches in the schools as a volunteer once a week. She is now working on a new poem, `` Meditation,'' which is eight pages long and is `` conversations with myself.''

<TEXT>
 The army began disarming the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s paramilitary force on Saturday, putting thousands of rifles into warehouses at the demand of opposition leaders. And <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>'s leading dissident warned the new coalition government being formed this weekend to implement democratic reforms without delay or face renewed opposition from millions who have taken to the streets. The <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Militia </ORGANIZATION>, the force created 40 years ago to protect the workplace from counterrevolution and later guarded the Communists' monopoly on power, began surrendering weapons to the army, the state-run news agency <ORGANIZATION> CTK </ORGANIZATION> reported. All weapons were expected to be in army hands by Sunday. `` This is to honor a pledge by the new Communist leadership that in the solution of the current political situation -LRB- the paramilitary -RRB- means of the party will not be used,'' an unnamed Politburo member was quoted as saying. The action came one day after Politburo member <PERSON> Vasil </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohorita </PERSON> agreed to turn over control of the Communists' militia to the state as a concession to opposition demands that the militia be disbanded. There was no mention of the future of the militia. The gray-uniformed militia is a paid, part-time force that is believed to have tens of thousands of members recruited from among workers. It was last used in January to help riot police smash a weeklong series of demonstrations in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>. In its terse dispatch, <ORGANIZATION> CTK </ORGANIZATION> noted that the Politburo spokesman made the announcement after concerns were expressed by segments of the population over `` increased movement of military vehicles on Czechoslovak territory.'' That was an obvious attempt to dispel any fears of army intervention to reverse the democratic reforms that have been promised. The beleaguered Communist-controlled government last week agreed to appoint a new government by Sunday that will include non-Communists for the first time since <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> tanks crushed `` Prague Spring'' reforms in 1968. Playwright <PERSON> Vaclav </PERSON> <PERSON> Havel </PERSON>, a leader of the Civic Forum opposition group, said the rapid pace of change must continue. `` If we are to structure our society in a democratic, peaceful, decent and loving way, and avoid possible conflicts, then it is necessary for the government to act quickly, and not only declare certain things, but really implement them,'' he told the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> daily Rude Pravo. `` Any kind of postponement or delay would turn not only against us, that is in this case the Civic Forum, but also against the government and the entire society,'' <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> said. `` It would mean that all of us failed to manage the situation,'' he added. <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> spoke after six tough hours of negotiations Friday with Czech Prime Minister <PERSON> Frantisek </PERSON> <PERSON> Pitra </PERSON> on the shape of the new government. Federal Premier <PERSON> Ladislav </PERSON> <PERSON> Adamec </PERSON> agreed Tuesday in talks with <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> and other Civic Forum representatives to include non-Communists in the government. An announcement was expected Sunday, government spokesman <PERSON> Marcel </PERSON> <PERSON> Jansen </PERSON> said. Because <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> is a federation of the Czech and Slovak republics, formation of the new federal government will have to be accompanied by overhauls in the Czech and Slovak governments. Justice and education, for instance, two key areas in which the opposition seeks reforms, are controlled by the republic governments. Civic Forum spokesman <PERSON> Jiri </PERSON> <PERSON> Dienstbier </PERSON> told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> the opposition is not proposing specific candidates for the new Cabinet but concentrating on outlining what characteristics the office holders should have. Communists, members of previously docile allied parties, and non-party people are acceptable to Civic Forum if they have no obvious blemishes in their pasts and are willing to implement reforms now that will lead to free elections and genuine democracy, <PERSON> Dienstbier </PERSON> said. Civic Forum, established only 13 days ago, is an umbrella movement of opposition groups. Its leaders have said they are not offering themselves for Cabinet posts but have left open the possibility of accepting nominations. `` I am a writer by profession, and I'd like to stay one,'' <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> said, when asked by <PERSON> Rude </PERSON> <PERSON> Pravo </PERSON> if he aimed for office. `` I never had ambitions of being a politician. I do n't feel qualified for it.'' `` I'd like to get back into the theater,'' he said. <PERSON> Havel </PERSON>'s plays were banned for 20 years here until censorship was largely removed last week `` I firmly believe and hope that it will not be necessary -LRB- for me to become a politician -RRB- and that the common good, which I always place above my own interests, is not going to force me into anything of the kind,'' <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> said. The formation of the new government will cap a week of historic changes, brought on by 11 days of anti-government demonstrations and a nationwide general strike Monday that sent millions into the streets. On Tuesday, <PERSON> Adamec </PERSON> agreed to include non-Communists in the government. On Wednesday, <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> formally removed the Communists' guaranteed leading role in politics from the constitution A Politburo member said free elections would be held within a year. On Friday, the Communists dramatically reversed 21 years of policy, condemning the 1968 invasion that crushed the `` Prague Spring'' reforms, and paving the way for a formal reassessment by the <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> later this month. Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> swiftly followed the admission by saying the 1968 reforms were correct and democratic and that the Soviet-led invasion was an `` inappropriate response'' from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>.

 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, commander-in-chief of the world's largest <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, was marooned on his own ship Saturday as a fierce December gale bewildered the best-laid plans of superpower leaders, protesters and local tourism officials. `` This is the type of weather that shipwrecked Saint <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> on these rocks. We usually have this in February,'' said <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Cassar </PERSON>, a government official on <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION>, host country to the snake-bit superpower summit. Winds gusting to 60 miles per hour and thundering foam-topped waves forced a postponement of a second round of talks between <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> until Sunday, as well as cancellation of a scheduled dinner. The weather also played havoc at the fringes of the summit. A big anti-nuclear parade was postponed until Sunday and <PERSON> Raisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s schedule of sightseeing on the island was disrupted. This was n't what local tourism officials had in mind, either. A government travel brochure describes <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> as the `` perfect winter holiday destination.'' `` The sun worshipper who flees <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s cold and damp winter weather finds in <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> the perfect refuge,'' the brochure says, adding that the island's mild winter climate `` makes it possible to practice quite a variety of winter sports.'' Be that as it may, seas that built overnight forced a change of sites for the opening session between <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. Instead of holding the morning meeting aboard the Soviet cruiser <PERSON> Slava </PERSON>, the leaders met aboard a Soviet luxury liner docked at a pier in a more sheltered part of the bay. The liner, the Maxim Gorky, normally caters to West German tourists on <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> cruises. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> crossed the choppy bay from his summit headquarters aboard the USS Belknap to the Gorky without incident on a canopy-covered admiral's barge. But returning after lunch was more of a problem as the heaving launch had to make three passes before it could safely deliver <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ship. Then, the weather got worse. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, a former naval aviator and speedboat enthusiast, wound up stuck on the cruiser for the night. `` The 60 mile per hour winds preclude any movements off the ship this evening, but they have made for a very exciting afternoon sail,'' said a statement by <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> was stranded with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, as were Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> and National Security Adviser <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON>. `` They can not get off of the <PERSON> Belknap </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s aide, <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON>. <PERSON> Sig </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogich </PERSON>, director of advance planning for the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, was asked if he was disappointed that the elaborately staged scene of the ships and meetings had been disrupted by the weather. <PERSON> Rogich </PERSON> frowned slightly and nodded. The original script called for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to travel by boat from the 8,600-ton <PERSON> Belknap </PERSON> to the 12,500-ton <PERSON> Slava </PERSON> to begin his talks with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. Conditions were not bad enough as to endanger anyone on board the heavy warships, but the waves were rough enough to make getting on and off from smaller shuttle craft a major problem. Summit planners apparently considered moving Saturday's meeting to land, but finally decided to use the 25,000-ton Gorky, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s floating residence during the weekend. It is moored at a pier about 1,000 yards from the <PERSON> Belknap </PERSON>. Moving the talks to the Gorky in case of bad weather was one of several contingencies that had been discussed prior to the weekend, said the assistant to the <LOCATION> Maltese </LOCATION> prime minister who has been in charge of planning the Maltese side of the meeting. `` It is December in the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Cacchia </PERSON> <PERSON> Caruana </PERSON>, noting the weather is always undependable this time of year. `` We made sure that both the Soviets and the Americans knew about it.'' `` We've done the best we could in three weeks,'' said <PERSON> Cacchia </PERSON> <PERSON> Caruana </PERSON> philosophically. `` We really could n't do anything about the weather.'' Fear of bad weather was one reason it was decided to hold the summit in <LOCATION> Marsaxlokk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> rather than further off the coast of <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION>, he said. Cold air from western <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION> appeared to be the culprit for the low pressure system causing the strong easterly winds over the central Mediterranean, said Maltese meteorologist <PERSON> Spiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Agius </PERSON>. `` It will definitely be improving tomorrow,'' <PERSON> Agius </PERSON> added. But maybe not. Forecaster <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Membrey </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> said to expect the strong winds to continue through Sunday afternoon.

 A formation of French-built Mirage 2000 jet fighters highlighted a two-hour military parade here Saturday marking the 18th anniversary of the 1971 merger of seven sheikdoms into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION>. Desert drummers and torch bearers marched through streets along with sword-wielding nationals in Bedouin robes and headgear as each of the emirates also held separate celebrations. U.A.E. President <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Zayed </PERSON> <PERSON> bin </PERSON> <PERSON> Sultan </PERSON> <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Nahyan </PERSON> attended the display of ground, sea and air weapons at a seafront boulevard in <LOCATION> Abu </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dhabi </LOCATION>. About 5,000 spectators packed a grandstand. Flanked by his top aides and rulers of the various emirates, the leader clapped as the Mirages swooped low overhead. One Mirage drew an ovation with aerobatics before formations of transport planes, armed helicopters and interceptors paraded. The Mirage 2000s, six in all, were delivered a few days ago, the first batch of a $ 2.2 billion deal signed with <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> in 1985 and involving a total of 36 Mirages and various types of military hardware. The arrival of the Mirages was seen as a sign of improved relations with <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> after a disagreement over a demand that the aircraft be equipped with U.S.-built Sidewinder air-to-surface missiles. The parade was attended by French Defense Minister <PERSON> Jean-Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Chevenement </PERSON> along with a number of <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> ministers and military commanders. Units of the various arms of the 43,000-strong armed forces took part in the parade, which also featured French-made Gazelle and Alouette III helicopters, Crotale, Exocet and Rapier missiles, Ferret scout cars, <PERSON> Saladin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Saracen </PERSON> armored personnel carriers. U.S.-made Hercules and <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION> transport planes and British-built Hawk jet fighters also were displayed. It was the first military parade since 1977. Armed Forces Chief of Staff Gen. <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Saeed </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Badi </PERSON> said the parades had been interrupted largely on account of `` sadness caused by the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> wars'' and the recent eight-year conflict between <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. A leading oil-exporting nation, the U.A.E. like its neighboring countries of the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> has diverted sizable funds from the oil bonanza years of the 1970s to build a strong military. Traditionally armed by <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, which controlled the former <ORGANIZATION> Trucial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> sheikdoms from which the U.A.E. was formed in 1971, the federation has spread out its military shopping. Aside from <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, it has concluded new arms deals with <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> offering unspecified types of weapons. <PERSON> Al-Badi </PERSON> said the U.A.E. was in the process of strengthening the armed forces and will shortly introduce conscription. The federation comprises <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Dhabi </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Dubai </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sharjah </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Ras </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Khaimah </PERSON>, Umm al-Quwain, <PERSON> Fujairah </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Ajman </LOCATION>, under the leadership of the bigger and richer <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Dhabi </PERSON>. The vast revenues from oil sales have helped turn large tracts into farmland, build light industries and give its estimated 1.8 million people one of the world's highest per capita incomes _ $ 15,000. Mainly due to oil and gas sales, the country's gross national product increased from $ 1.81 billion in 1972 to $ 24.52 billion in 1989, according to <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> statements. The federation, mainly <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Dhabi </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Dubai </LOCATION>, produces a total of 2.6 million barrels of crude oil a day, according to a recent statement by Oil Minister <PERSON> Mana </PERSON> <PERSON> Saeed </PERSON> <PERSON> Otaiba </PERSON>. It earned some $ 3.5 billion this year from oil exports, but suffers a budget deficit of $ 500 million. The deficits have been chronic since the world oil market weakened in the early 1980s. <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Zayed </PERSON> in a speech appealed to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> to hasten the pace toward a peace treaty `` so that the gulf may reap the fruit of stability and security.'' He also declared his `` undivided support'' for the Palestinian uprising against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, asking leaders of the world to help the Palestinians regain their `` rights and stop the barbaric perpetrations of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> against the Arabs in occupied territory.'' He urged the people and leaders of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> to patch up their differences and push their country toward national reconciliation.

 Black nationalist <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> eventually will be freed from prison, President F.W. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> said Saturday, but he refused to say when. Meanwhile, police used dogs, whips and batons to break up protest rallies in <LOCATION> Durban </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>, witnesses said, while a march to a police station in the rural <ORGANIZATION> Orange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> was allowed. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> returned from a visit to the <LOCATION> Ivory </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>, which has demanded that <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> be released before it agrees to establish diplomatic relations with <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. `` As and when it is possible, he will be released. But I am not prepared to speculate on when,'' <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> told a news conference in <LOCATION> Yamoussoukro </LOCATION> after a day of talks with President <PERSON> Felix </PERSON> <PERSON> Houphouet-Boigny </PERSON> in the <LOCATION> Ivory </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, 71, was convicted of sabotage and subversion in 1964 and is serving a life term. Last year, the <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> leader was admitted to a hospital with tuberculosis and later transferred to a home on a prison farm. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> said he was hopeful that <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> could establish relations with the <LOCATION> Ivory </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>, whose president has praised his reforms. `` I do n't think it is a dream. It can become a reality,'' he said. <PERSON> Houphouet-Boigny </PERSON> has made clear that though he favors closer economic ties with <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and favors negotiations to end apartheid, <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> must be released before full relations can be established. Police used whips and dogs to break up an attempted march by thousands of blacks against inadequate housing and rent increases in <LOCATION> Durban </LOCATION>, said a journalist, who said children were trampled as the crowd fled in all directions. Shoppers, and people posting Christmas mail were dragged away to police vehicles. Police said they used rubber batons to disperse thousands of people who marched in the streets in defiance of a police order.

<HEAD>Bomb Tossed at Cabinet Minister's Home; No Injuries</HEAD>

 A bomb was tossed from a speeding car Saturday at the south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> home of Information Minister <PERSON> Edmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Rizk </PERSON>, a foe of Christian Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, causing damage but no injuries, police said. Also Saturday, <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s command accused Syrian forces of firing at a Lebanese army helicopter hovering over thousands of <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> supporters forming a human wall around his headquarters in the presidential palace. A communique said eight supporters were wounded by falling shrapnel from a Syrian anti-aircraft barrage, which missed the helicopter. `` Gen. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> bestowed military medals on the eight injured youths,'' the communique said. It did not specify the seriousness of their injuries. The Syrian army command in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> did not comment. The incident occurred a few hours before the arrival of eight French lawmakers to declare support for <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, who opposes <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s Syrian-backed president and has vowed to drive Syrian troops out of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> <PERSON> Rizk </PERSON>, a Maronite like <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, was in Moslem west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> when his house was bombed at 10:30 a.m. in his hometown of <LOCATION> Jizzine </LOCATION>, 25 miles south of the capital. His wife and children, who were at the house, escaped injury, according to police. <PERSON> Rizk </PERSON> was among the Lebanese legislators who approved an Arab-brokered peace plan for <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in a special <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> session in <LOCATION> Taif </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> in October. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> opposed the accord because it does not set a timetable for the withdrawal of the 40,000 Syrian troops in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The accord cleared the way for election of a president. <PERSON> Rizk </PERSON> was named information minister in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s newly formed national reconciliation government, which was entrusted with applying the Taif accord to end 14 years of civil war. <PERSON> Rizk </PERSON>'s house was the first to be attacked in areas controlled by the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lebanon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, a predmoninantly <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> militia allied with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. There were similar bomb attacks on the homes of eight other legislators in the Christian enclave controlled by <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s army in the past five weeks. <PERSON> Rizk </PERSON> blamed the attack on `` Gen. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> and agents he recruited to undermine the whole of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>.'' The right-wing French parliamentarians did not make any statements when they arrived at the shell-wrecked presidential palace in <LOCATION> Baabda </LOCATION>, five miles east of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. They held a brief meeting with <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, who refuses to give up the palace to President <PERSON> Elias </PERSON> <PERSON> Hrawi </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hrawi </PERSON> was elected by <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> last month after <PERSON> Rene </PERSON> <PERSON> Mouawad </PERSON> was assassinated by a bomb after 17 days in office. The French legislators then joined a dance with some of the thousands of Christian youths camped in the woods around the palace since Tuesday to raise the ante if <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> decides to attack <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>. Last week, 33 right-wing <ORGANIZATION> French </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> members visited the <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> enclave for 24 hours to declare support for <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>. The Moslem Voice of the Nation radio said the final decision on how to evict <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> from the palace will be taken this week. It said <PERSON> Hrawi </PERSON> agreed to delay the move in an effort to prevent bloodshed. `` But if <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> refuses to end his mutiny peacefully, then the proper decision will be taken,'' the radio said. An-Nahar, an independent daily, quoted <PERSON> Hrawi </PERSON> as saying an assault to dislodge <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> has been delayed at the request of a `` number of Arab and foreign states'' that he did not identify. But at a news conference Thursday, <PERSON> Hrawi </PERSON> said, `` The day of judgment is very near.'' <PERSON> Hrawi </PERSON>, a Maronite Christian like <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, stressed that he hoped <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> would leave the palace peacefully. <PERSON> Hrawi </PERSON>'s remark coincided with a buildup of Syrian tanks, artillery, and commando forces around the 310-square-mile Christian enclave north of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, an apparent preparation for an assault to dislodge <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>. Syrian troops were deployed in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in 1976 under an <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping mandate to quell the civil war fighting. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> said they abrogated the mandate by siding with the Moslems.

 From the victims of <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> Flight 103 to `` Women for a meaningful summit,'' led by the divorced wife of former Greek Premier <PERSON> Andreas </PERSON> <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON>, interest groups with their own agenda were also stymied Saturday by the storm from placing their issues before the summiteers. A delegation of the families of victims of the <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION> air disaster arrived in <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> Saturday with a letter urging <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to impose an economic squeeze on such countries as <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> for their alleged backing of terrorism. On Sunday, they planned to drop 270 flowers in the storm-tossed Mediterranean in remembrance of those killed when a terrorist bomb ripped apart the <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> airliner over the Scottish town last December 21. Many of the groups had planned to deliver statements to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> or <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> aides, most of whom were tied up in the storm-tossed meetings or not reachable at their hotels or the Maxim Gorky liner docked at <LOCATION> Marsaxlokk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>. Dr. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Swire </PERSON> said he had confirmation, however, that the delegation's four-page message had been received at the White House. At another venue, <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> and her women's peace network claiming to represent `` millions of women around the world -LRB- who -RRB- have sent representatives to all summit meetings'', urged an end to nuclear testing, chemical and biological arms ban and the strengthening of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>.

The <ORGANIZATION> Greenpeace </ORGANIZATION> activists said they would try to interfere with an impending Trident II missile test off the coast of <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canaveral </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>. Other groups with delegations include the National Conference for Soviet Jewry, and the <ORGANIZATION> Maltese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> _ presently out of power in the Maltese grovernment _ which organized a peace concert in a <LOCATION> Valletta </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hall </LOCATION> and promised a rally for Sunday if and when the weather improved

 New reform-minded <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leaders have condemned the 1968 <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact invasion of <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> in which Bulgarian troops took part, the state-run news agency <ORGANIZATION> BTA </ORGANIZATION> said Saturday. Each of the five <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact nations that joined in the invasion of their neighbor has recently criticized the operation. Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> on Friday called the invasion an `` inappropriate response.'' The ruling party Politburo and the government studied the issue and noted that the decision to crush <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>'s `` Prague Spring'' reforms was conditioned by the international situation at the end of the 1960s, <ORGANIZATION> BTA </ORGANIZATION> said. <ORGANIZATION> BTA </ORGANIZATION> said that situation was `` characterized by confrontation, armament races and relentless ideological fighting.'' The <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact decision to send tanks and troops was influenced by `` deformed concepts of socialist society. `` Looking back from today's point of view,'' <ORGANIZATION> BTA </ORGANIZATION> said, `` and from the positions of restructuring and new political thinking, the action taken in August 1968 is assessed as unjustifiable and illegal. `` History has proved it to be wrong and incompatible with the new course of the Bulgarian <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and the Bulgarian state,'' said <ORGANIZATION> BTA </ORGANIZATION>, which reflects government policy. Referring to the moves toward democratization in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> BTA </ORGANIZATION> said `` the dynamic processes which have been recently triggered in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> are received in <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> with understanding and sympathy.'' Led by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, every <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact nation except <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> took part in the 1968 invasion, which crushed democratic reforms and led to the installation of hard-line Communist leaders. The invasion recently has been condemned by leaders of <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, as well as <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>'s longtime hard-line <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Todor </PERSON> <PERSON> Zhivkov </PERSON> was ousted on Nov. 10 and replaced by <PERSON> Petar </PERSON> <PERSON> Mladenov </PERSON>, who is considered more moderate.

 A member of <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s collective presidency said multiparty democracy is bound to prevail in this Communist-ruled nation, a <LOCATION> Zagreb </LOCATION> daily reported Saturday. <PERSON> Stipe </PERSON> <PERSON> Suvar </PERSON>, the Croatian republic's representative in the eight-person Yugoslav presidency, was quoted as saying Communism `` is heading for the reconstruction of political -LRB- freedoms -RRB- that will certainly result in a multiparty system.'' His comments were in an interview carried in the Vjesnik daily newspaper. `` I would prefer for two parties to emerge ... and to creatively compete,'' he was quoted as saying, adding that `` even if the present <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> were to disintegrate, a new party would eventually emerge in its ashes.'' He also blasted the republic of <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION> for severing ties with the more liberal republic of <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION>, the newspaper reported. Mass Serbian rallies `` can not make <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> a happier place,'' he was quoted as saying. In an unprecedented move, the leadership of <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s largest republic, broke off all business and government contacts with <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION> Wednesday after authorities there banned the rally by an estimated 40,000 Serbs They were reportedly seeking the ouster of <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION>'s liberal leadership. <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> consists of six republics and two autonomous provinces, each with its own government and party structure. The decentralized system of government and a collective federal presidency were devised to prevent one republic from gaining sway over the others, but it has often resulted in tensions and ineffective government by compromise. In the interview, <PERSON> Suvar </PERSON> also described the current counterrevolutionary activities trial of <PERSON> Azem </PERSON> <PERSON> Vlasi </PERSON>, a former leader of hard-line <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>'s southern province of <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>, as `` unnecessary and harmful'' for <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>. He called for <PERSON> Vlasi </PERSON>'s release In <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s largest political trial in decades, <PERSON> Vlasi </PERSON> and 14 other ethnic Albanian defendants are accused of opposing <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION> in its drive to strengthen its control over the impoverished province. <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION> has been the scene of continuing unrest that left at least 28 people dead this year. Ethnic Albanians, who make up almost nine-tenths of the region's 1.9 million people, are seeking greater autonomy for their province <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION> exercises some control over <LOCATION> Kosovo </LOCATION>, though it is nominally autonomous. <PERSON> Vlasi </PERSON>'s trial has been sharply criticized in <LOCATION> Slovenia </LOCATION> and by international human rights groups.

 Hundreds of Israeli troops seized uniforms, hatchets and homemade swords on Saturday during house-to-house searches in an area where the army had killed four armed Palestinians. At least 30 Arabs were detained during the operation, which came one day after soldiers clashed with seven members of a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> gang called the <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Panthers </ORGANIZATION> outside a barber shop in the Casbah quarter of <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>. Four Palestinians were slain during the clash. In the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> on Saturday, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers shot and wounded 23 Palestinians during a sympathy strike for the four, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said. Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Mordechai </PERSON> on Saturday blamed the <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Panthers </ORGANIZATION> for killing 16 Palestinians suspected of collaborating with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and said its activities were directed by <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION> faction of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. Since the start of the Palestinian uprising, underground groups known as `` strike forces'' and `` popular committees'' have been formed to enforce orders of its PLO-backed leadership. Some of these groups have gradually focused on violent interrogations and killings of suspected collaborators as a main activity. In the past four months of his command, <PERSON> Mordechai </PERSON> said 130 hard-core activists had been arrested from groups such as the <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Panthers </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eagles </ORGANIZATION>, which have used weapons in attacks on <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers and killed Palestinians suspected of having ties to <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> authorities. The use of weapons contradicts <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> policy against using arms in the nearly 2-year-old Palestinian uprising. Recent leaflets from the pro-PLO underground criticized the slaying of alleged collaborators and disowned the renegade actions of unauthorized groups. Some 154 Palestinians have been killed by other Arabs, while 624 Palestinians have been killed by Israelis during the uprising. The latest death came Saturday when <PERSON> Hamad </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaber </PERSON>, 20, of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> village of <LOCATION> Tayasir </LOCATION>, died of wounds suffered in a clash with troops three weeks ago. <PERSON> Mordechai </PERSON> spoke at the site of Friday's shootout outside <PERSON> Kamal </PERSON>'s Salon, a barber shop in the <LOCATION> Casbah </LOCATION> quarter, where 30,000 Palestinians live Bloodstains, broken window panes and shards of porcelain coffee cup were seen. An army officer said slain <PERSON> Black </PERSON> <PERSON> Panther </PERSON> leader <PERSON> Imad </PERSON> <PERSON> Nasser </PERSON>, 29, was holding the cup when soldiers approached the group. Across the street, two Palestinian men in their 20s kneeled against a graffiti-covered wall, hands bound behind their backs and blindfolded. Army officers said more than 30 Palestinians were detained Saturday. Unofficial reports estimated the number of detainees at 60 to 100. `` I think the people of <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> will be be grateful to hear that this group is under control,'' said <PERSON> Mordechai </PERSON>, who claimed to have documents linking the <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Panthers </ORGANIZATION> to senior <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION> officials. `` Behind this group are high-level <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> officials supporting, giving money and encouraging them.'' `` There is no serious group left operating in this area,'' said Col. <PERSON> Raanan </PERSON> <PERSON> Gissin </PERSON>, deputy army spokesman who guided reporters on a tour of the <LOCATION> Casbah </LOCATION>, where a curfew kept residents off the streets. Reporters were taken to a secondary school where soldiers had collected dozens of knives and swords, piles of uniforms, outlawed <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> flags, slingshots, posters of <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, wooden clubs and axes. According to witness accounts from <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reporters, Israeli forces disguised as Arabs and wearing <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> headdresses arrived Friday in a red Mercedes with distinctive blue <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> license plates. They surprised the <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Panthers </ORGANIZATION> in the barber shop and opened fire. <PERSON> Mordechai </PERSON> described that account as a `` tall story.'' He said the soldiers were in uniform and arrived on foot after being alerted by an army lookout. <PERSON> Gissin </PERSON> said two Palestinians were killed on the spot and two died of wounds later. He said one of those killed tried to grab the gun of an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldier. Bloodstains mark the spot where he died. Drops of blood were also visible where three Black Panthers were wounded. `` In these kind of clashes, you have to fire first if you want to survive,'' <PERSON> Gissin </PERSON> said. `` The soldiers had no choice but to draw fast and fire first.'' <PERSON> Mordechai </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Palestnians </LOCATION> did not get off a shot, but other officers said one Palestinian weapon had a bullet in the chamber, ready to fire.

 More than 13 years after a car bomb killed an investigative reporter for <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>'s largest newspaper, the murder case has been reopened even though the motive is as murky as ever. When Attorney General <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Corbin </PERSON> leans back and puts his cowboy boots on the desk in his Old West-style office, he can choose from a tangle of theories about who ordered the death of <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> reporter <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Bolles </PERSON>. There's the mob. Casinos. Race track owners. Bankers. Even a jealous ex-husband. And there are plots within plots. One theory is that the hit men collected twice, from different people. So far, though, only one man has been convicted, and the masterminds, whoever they were, remain free. <PERSON> Corbin </PERSON>, a Republican whose office comes up for election next year, has been attacked by potential challengers for not solving the case. But he insists those attacks were not a factor in his decision to reinstate a murder charge last week against <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Robison </PERSON>, a plumber accused of setting off the bomb. <PERSON> Corbin </PERSON> says he has `` new evidence'' but wo n't say what it is or where it points. `` You do n't need motive for a conviction,'' he said. `` It helps ... but I do n't need to show motive.'' <PERSON> Bolles </PERSON>, 47, died 11 days after the radio-controlled bomb blew up his car in a hotel parking lot in June 1976. As he lay dying, he was heard to say `` <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Adamson </PERSON>,'' `` Emprise'' and `` Mafia.'' <ORGANIZATION> Emprise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, now known as <ORGANIZATION> Delaware </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Companies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, was a partner with the Funk family of <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> in dog-racing tracks. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> Adamson </PERSON>, 45, who ultimately became the only man convicted in the case so far, was a greyhound breeder and tow-truck operator who drank heavily and used cocaine. <PERSON> Bolles </PERSON> had left a note at his desk saying he was planning to meet him to discuss a land-fraud scheme involving high-level politicians. At trial, <PERSON> Adamson </PERSON> testified in return for leniency, saying he planted the car bomb and <PERSON> Robison </PERSON> triggered it on orders from <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunlap </PERSON>, a man trying to ingratiate himself with land and liquor magnate <PERSON> Kemper </PERSON> <PERSON> Marley </PERSON>. <PERSON> Marley </PERSON>, a target of <PERSON> Bolles </PERSON>' stories, was never charged with the crime, however, and an appeals court threw out the <PERSON> Robison </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dunlap </PERSON> convictions. <PERSON> Dunlap </PERSON> was released, though <PERSON> Robison </PERSON>, 67, remains in prison on an unrelated assault conviction. <PERSON> Corbin </PERSON> decided to drop charges against <PERSON> Robison </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dunlap </PERSON> when <PERSON> Adamson </PERSON> refused to testify in a retrial unless he got a better deal than he originally bargained for. <PERSON> Corbin </PERSON>, arguing that <PERSON> Adamson </PERSON> had broken the plea bargain, brought him to trial and won a murder conviction and death sentence he hoped would persuade <PERSON> Adamson </PERSON> to talk. A federal appeals court threw out <PERSON> Adamson </PERSON>'s death sentence earlier this year, however, and <PERSON> Corbin </PERSON> filed a new murder charge against <PERSON> Robison </PERSON> last week without waiting for further appeals to be heard by the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. A preliminary hearing is scheduled for January. Separately, a state grand jury is investigating potential obstruction of justice charges and has called in witnesses that could fit several of the scenarios. Several people, including free-lance reporter <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Devereux </PERSON>, have theorized that <PERSON> Bolles </PERSON> may have been killed because he was investigating industrial gold thefts and their ties to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> bankers. <PERSON> Devereux </PERSON> and others have suggested <PERSON> Bolles </PERSON> was looking at dog-track skimming, however, and they cite his dying words. Still others have linked the death to a `` Mafia diary'' that describes casino skimming, but that some contend is a forgery. And some, including <PERSON> Corbin </PERSON> at one time, have pointed to a member of the Funk family as a `` contingency suspect,'' saying he resented his ex-wife's closeness with <PERSON> Bolles </PERSON>, whom she confided in. Some of the theories overlap, and there are those who believe the hit men may have been paid originally by one person before persuading a second who did n't know about the first contract to pay for it too. <PERSON> Adamson </PERSON> declined to be interviewed last week, and <PERSON> Robison </PERSON> referred a reporter to his attorney, who did not return calls. The reopening of the case pleased those close to <LOCATION> Bolles </LOCATION>. His brother <PERSON> Richard </PERSON>, an author, said: `` I'd just like to know the truth.'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Winters </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Bolles </LOCATION> colleague who still covers the case, said: `` You at least have some activity going on in the case.''

<HEAD>East German Ambassador Apologizes for Treatment of Poles</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The East German ambassador apologized on behalf of his government for poor treatment of Poles in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> during an unusual address Saturday on Polish national television. `` In the name of my government, I want to apologize to all Poles who suffered troubles, like damage to their property, insults, undignified treatment,'' said <PERSON> Juergen </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Zwoll </PERSON> in his five-minute speech. Speaking Polish, the East German diplomat said the actions against Poles `` usually grew out of momentary emotions, nervousness, excitement _ but sometimes also on the unhealthy soil of nationalism.'' <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, along with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, invaded <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> at the outbreak of World War II in September 1939. Earlier this week, Polish media reported that Poles in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> were being harrassed at food stores, refused meals in restaurants, and suffering attacks on their property. The Polish government sent a delegation led by <PERSON> Boguslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Miernik </PERSON>, a senior <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> official, to <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> on Nov. 28 to investigate, the official <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> news agency said. <PERSON> Miernik </PERSON> told reporters Saturday he had informed the East German government that the Polish government would not tolerate discriminatory acts against Polish citizens in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> said.

<TEXT>
 At the Sea Goddess Temple on Saturday, <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Ying-shi </PERSON> tossed the wood blocks once, twice, three times. `` That's it,'' said the grizzled fisherman. `` Sea Goddess says no voting today.'' As he hobbled away, a young woman in a blue dress took his place in front of the altar, facing an image of the fetching goddess. `` I've never voted before,'' she said with a shy smile after tossing the blocks, a Buddhist ritual. `` I needed advice.'' Indeed, for the first time in <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s history, a legal opposition party has given voters something close to real choice in the first nationwide elections since martial law was lifted in 1987. Long lines formed at polling booths throughout the island. `` We've been going full steam since 8 a.m.,'' said one police officer at a polling station near the Sea Goddess Temple in northern <LOCATION> Taipei </LOCATION>. `` It's just getting busier.'' As he spoke, three elderly women moved slowly out of the voting booth. `` We choose the opposition,'' said one, as she stood between her two sisters clutching their hands. `` We talked about it last night and decided to vote our mind. The people must speak.'' The opposition, or <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, ran a spirited campaign against the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which has governed <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> since 1949 when it fled mainland <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> after losing a civil war to the Communists. The <ORGANIZATION> DPP </ORGANIZATION> finds its strength mostly among the Taiwanese working class who were here when the mainlanders came over from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. The opposition portrayed the Nationalists as corrupt, accusing them of vote-buying and using state-run television to push Nationalist candidates. The Nationalists depicted the opposition as a chaotic band of radicals, ready to proclaim <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s cultural and political independence from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. The issue was an emotional one because <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has warned it could attack <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> if this island of 20 million proclaims independence. It also cut to the heart of the Nationalists claim on power. Ever since fleeing to <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, the Nationalists have said they alone are the legitimate government of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Chang </PERSON>, an 83-year-old retired <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> official, fled to <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> in 1948 to help set up a government for the beleagured Nationalists and their leader <PERSON> Generalissimo </PERSON> <PERSON> Chiang </PERSON> <PERSON> Kai-shek </PERSON>. After years of supporting <PERSON> Chiang </PERSON>'s martial law policies, <PERSON> Chang </PERSON> said he now he supports political liberalization. `` But slowly, slowly,'' he said, banging his cane on the pavement. His grandson, <PERSON> Chang </PERSON> <PERSON> Yin-lien </PERSON> agreed. `` Instability is a bad thing,'' said the 25-year-old law student who voted for the Nationalists with his grandfather in western <LOCATION> Taipei </LOCATION>. `` We want calm for <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>.'' Their viewpoint is common among <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s people, strongly influenced by Confucian ethics that worship harmony. Still, some voters said they did n't agree. `` A little turmoil may not be a bad thing,'' said one voter after casting his ballot for the opposition. `` It's like marriage. If you do n't argue, you never make up.''

<TEXT>
 A 21-month-old girl was drinking liquids, growing more alert and doing well Saturday, five days after becoming the nation's first living-donor liver-transplant recipient, a hospital spokesman said. While <PERSON> Alyssa </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> recovered with her mother, who gave the child part of her liver Monday, surgeons at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> were deciding whether a 15-month-old <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> girl could undergo a similar operation. `` Doctors will continue to evaluate and assess the options and decide whether she still fits the protocol for a living-donor'' liver transplant, said spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Easton </PERSON>. <PERSON> Sarina </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Millington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, remained in serious condition in the hospital's intensive care unit, a day after she was flown in by air ambulance and taken by helicopter to the hospital, <PERSON> Easton </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Sarina </PERSON> suffered from an infection recently, and was not considered an immediate candidate for surgery. `` It does n't look like it's going to be this weekend,'' said medical center spokeswoman <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Fetsch </PERSON>. `` It's tentatively set for Wednesday.'' <PERSON> Sarina </PERSON>'s parents, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON>, 20, and <PERSON> Michelle </PERSON>, 21, who live near <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, arrived Friday night, a few hours after their daughter. `` They said our chances were small, but they're still chances,'' said the father, a dry-wall installer and contractor. He is expected to act as donor for his blond, blue-eyed daughter, who became a transplant candidate almost a year ago but whose parents became frustrated waiting for a suitable organ in the <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION> area. Both little girls suffered from biliary atresia, a usually fatal genetic disorder involved in more liver transplants than other ailments. <PERSON> Sarina </PERSON>'s condition was more advanced than <PERSON> Alyssa </PERSON>'s, however, even though <PERSON> Alyssa </PERSON> had also waited a year after becoming a transplant candidate, Ms. <PERSON> Fetsch </PERSON> said Friday. <PERSON> Alyssa </PERSON>'s mother, 29-year-old schoolteacher <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, was in good condition Saturday while recuperating from the operation, in which she donated the left lobe of her liver, <PERSON> Easton </PERSON> said. `` Mom's doing well,'' <PERSON> Easton </PERSON> said. `` I imagine she's still in some discomfort. But she's not having any complications.'' The girl's father, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, 27, an assistant shipping supervisor, has been at the hospital this week with his wife and daughter, as well as the couple's 3-year-old son, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON>. The Smiths, of <LOCATION> Schertz </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>, are the first people to participate in a living-donor transplant in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which followed a total of four such procedures in other countries _ <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. One child has died. The <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> developed its living-donor liver-transplant program, in which it hopes to perform the surgery on 20 patients within 12 months, partly as a response to the shortage of available organs from children's cadavers for youngsters who need liver transplants. An estimated 25 to 50 percent of children who need liver transplants die without them. Dr. <PERSON> Christoph </PERSON> <PERSON> Broelsch </PERSON>, who led the surgical team in Monday's operation on <PERSON> Alyssa </PERSON>, pioneered the technique of transplanting part of adult organs into youngsters, whose abdominal cavities are too small to hold a whole adult liver

 The memory of four previous riots this decade hangs over <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> as the racially charged manslaughter trial of a policeman nears its end, but this time there is hope the bloodshed can be avoided. `` I've got a very good feeling about it,'' <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>'s Mayor <PERSON> Xavier </PERSON> <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON> said Friday after a visit to an school in a predominantly black neighborhood. `` I think a couple of blacks on the jury _ that's very helpful. The process is going to be viewed this time as complex, but fair.'' Barring last-minute delays, the case of officer <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON>, 31, accused of manslaughter in the deaths of a black motorcyclist and his passenger, is expected to go to the six-member jury later this week. The trial was recessed on Friday until Monday. <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON> faces two counts of manslaughter in the deaths of <ORGANIZATION> Clement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lloyd </ORGANIZATION>, 23, and <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON>'s passenger, <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON>, 24. <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON> shot <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> in the head, killing him instantly. <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON>, also black, died the next day of head injuries suffered in the subsequent crash. Four times since 1980 _ including the Jan. 16 shooting that led to the current trial _ racial disturbances were touched off by violent encounters between police and blacks, or by the subsequent acquittal of the officers by all-white juries. <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Sims </PERSON>, a black member of <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, says he has felt the difference participation in the legal system makes in the community's reaction. `` You have blacks on the jury, you have a black prosecutor,'' says <PERSON> Sims </PERSON>. `` It definitely goes a long way toward defusing the situation _ you reduce the perception of unfairness.'' Another difference is that the local media have given almost blanket coverage of the trial. The school district's television station <ORGANIZATION> WLRN </ORGANIZATION> runs a complete tape of the day's proceedings each night. Radio station WINZ-AM interrupts its programming with live broadcasts from the trial. Several commercial television broadcasters _ including <ORGANIZATION> Cable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> nationally _ carried <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON>'s appearance live on Thursday. The media have acted more responsibly than before the previous riots, asserts <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON>, a prominent black sociologist and author of a book on the May 1980 riot that left 18 people dead. That violence followed the acquittal of policemen accused of beating to death black insurance executive <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> McDuffie </PERSON>. `` I just do n't have a sense of any tremendous support for a riot in the wake of an acquittal,'' <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON> says. `` In going around the community, you do n't hear the same level of anger as before the <PERSON> McDuffie </PERSON> riot. ... There is an overwhelming sentiment in the community for peace.'' Another difference is that unlike 1980, the city police are ready this time if there is unrest. The department has 700 new gas masks and two armored vehicles, and has upgraded shields, batons and other equipment, says police spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivero </PERSON>. Police will move in quickly at the first sign of trouble. `` We have a major plan where every policeman in this entire department has an assignment,'' <PERSON> Rivero </PERSON> says. `` We are going to put everybody in jail who breaks the law.'' But not everyone shares the optimism of local officials, or feels that two black jurors will be enough to prevent violence in case of an acquittal. At the Nu Lounge _ a bar only 100 feet or so from where <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON> shot <LOCATION> Lloyd </LOCATION> _ many patrons fear the trial will end in a replay of what they see as a long history of injustice. `` Since 1919 until today, it's been the same _ ` Get the nigger,''' says <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, 72, a lifelong resident of the community. He mentions the <PERSON> McDuffie </PERSON> case and the 1982 shooting of <PERSON> Nevell </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, a black, in a video arcade only a few blocks away, which both sparked rioting. In 1984, violence broke out again when an all-white jury acquitted <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> police officer <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Alvarez </PERSON> in <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s shooting. `` All these things make the guy in the street feel like ` a policeman can kill me because I'm black,''' says <PERSON> Ivory </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, a former policeman and now a longshoreman. `` That's why people want a guilty verdict, so they feel our children's lives are worth something.'' While attention has focused on black neighborhoods where the riots took place, the case also has riveted the attention of south <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s Hispanic community _ especially the 200,000 Colombians who constitute the region's second-largest Latin ethnic group, after Cuban-Americans. Even in <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON>'s homeland of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, news of the trial is carried in detail by the media, and a fund-raising drive has helped pay the expenses of his legal defense. Support for the policeman is widespread, says <PERSON> Dario </PERSON> <PERSON> Restrepo </PERSON>, a member of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hispanic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> and governor of the Colombian <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON>'s brothers and his wife are all law enforcement officers, he notes _ a welcome relief to a nationality whose country has become synonymous with cocaine trafficking.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> proposed to Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> on Saturday that <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact conclude a treaty to reduce conventional forces in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> next year and sign the accord at an international summit meeting in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said. The proposal was part of a presentation on arms control, trade, human rights and other U.S.-Soviet issues that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> outlined at the opening round of talks with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> at their storm-tossed summit, according to officials who asked not to be identified by name. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also suggested that Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> and Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> meet next month in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to resolve several key issues blocking agreement on a separate treaty to reduce <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet long-range nuclear weapons by 30 to 50 percent, the officials said. That pact would be signed at a superpower summit to be held in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> suggested be held in the second half of June, according to officials. The recommendations extended to a call for the two summit partners to jointly propose <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> as the site for the Olympic Games in 2004 _ a gesture that would dramatize the improvement in East-West relations. On the negative side, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> the continued delivery of Soviet arms to leftist rebels in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> through surrogates was the single most destructive factor in the superpower relationship, said the officials. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> did not respond directly to any of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s initiatives. Presumably, the response, at least in part, would come on Sunday during a final day of talks. On the arms-control front, officials said that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was willing to end production of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> chemical weapons once an international treaty is put into operation to ban poison gas. On trade issues, the officials said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told the Soviet leader the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would support granting <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> observer status in the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, a 97-nation trade organization, once the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> eases emigration restrictions, as it has promised. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also proposed negotiations begin on a trade agreement that would also lift tariff and import controls against Soviet goods entering the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the official said. The trade restrictions were imposed by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in the mid-1970s with the aim of forcing the exodus of Soviet Jews. The official made clear that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s offers were conditional, based on completion of Soviet legislation to establish freedom of travel. Completion of that landmark law is expected within a month. One of the restrictive <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> laws, known as the Jackson-Vanik Amendment, has for many years denied the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> the kind of access to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> markets enjoyed by most other nations by imposing high tariffs. The other legislation, known as the Stevenson Amendment, denies export credits to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. Apart from imminent action on emigration, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is in the midst of reconstructing its economy under <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s perestroika campaign A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> urged <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to move toward a market-pricing system. But he gave no indication how <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> responded to any of the President's propositions. But <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is known to want Soviet entry to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> proposed only observer status for the Soviets _ not full membership. It would be granted next year, the official said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposal for an international summit in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> follows one by <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> last week to have the leaders of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and 33 European countries meet next year to ease East-West divisions. The treaty that would be signed is under negotiation in the Austrian capital between <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact. It would reduce <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet troops in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> to 275,000 each and also cut tanks, artillery and other non-nuclear weapons from the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> Ural </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The two key obstacles at this point concern what kinds of airplanes to scale back and whether to include a Turkish port through which supplies flow to Turkish troops on <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>. The strategic arms reduction treaty, known as START, is under negotiation in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> and <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> should focus on such nagging problems as how many nuclear-tipped air-launched cruise missiles to be permitted, whether missiles not deployed on bombers, submarines or in silos should be scrapped and measures to prevent the disguising of missile tests. In the area of human right, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> that `` all outstanding human rights cases'' should be resolved before that meeting, an official said. He presented a list of cases to the Soviet leader. The number was not disclosed.

 The leader of the Ukrainian <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> urged millions of faithful in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION> on Saturday to take advantage of new concessions allowing them to register with authorities. `` We have prayed for this day for over 43 years, and <PERSON> God </PERSON> has answered our prayers,'' Rome-based Cardinal <PERSON> Myroslav </PERSON> <PERSON> Lubachivsky </PERSON> said. `` Our suffering is coming to an end.'' <PERSON> Lubachivsky </PERSON> was referring to Friday's announcement by government officials in the <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION> that Ukrainian Catholics could officially register their congregations like other religious groups. The church has been banned since 1946. The move came as Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> was holding historic talks at the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> with Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. `` I call upon our faithful in <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION> to avail themselves of this right and to begin to register our congregations with authorities as soon as possible,'' <PERSON> Lubachivsky </PERSON> said in a statement. He described the decision by <LOCATION> Ukrainian </LOCATION> officials as a `` first step'' toward complete legalization of the church, which was suppressed by dictator <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> in 1946 and forced to merge with the Russian Orthodox Church. According to Western estimates, there are 4 million to 6 million Catholics in the <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION>. Until recently, they practiced their faith clandestinely, but in recent months many have emerged to worship openly and demand official recognition. The pope on Friday urged <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to assure full religious freedom for the Ukrainian church and all Soviet Catholics, estimated at 10 million. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> pledged that a new law guaranteeing religious freedom for all faiths would be adopted soon and he invited the pope to visit the country. `` We extend our sincere and deep gratitude to -LRB- the pope -RRB- for his unwavering support of our church,'' said <PERSON> Lubachivsky </PERSON>, former Metropolitan-Archbishop of <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. He urged Ukrainian Catholics to `` work patiently and according to the law with the authorities'' and to respect the churches now controlled by the Russian Orthodox Church. The Russian Orthodox have opposed legalization of the Ukrainian <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>. They stand to lose hundreds of churches and thousands of followers they gained with the suppression of the Catholics.

<HEAD>Bible Smuggling Days Over as Soviet Union Grants Religious Freedom</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BATTLE CREEK, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>

 A private investigator who secretly distributed Bibles behind the Iron Curtain for nearly 15 years says he's happy that religious reforms in the Soviet bloc may end his days as a smuggler for God. `` I've been able to smuggle in $ 2.5 million in Scriptures since the middle 1970s,'' <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Grevers </PERSON> said. `` The days of smuggling are over.'' President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> pledged Friday to <PERSON> Pope </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> that he would establish diplomatic ties with the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> and guarantee religious freedom in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said people `` have a right to satisfy their spiritual needs.'' `` Many Christians behind the Iron Curtain have been praying for this for years,'' <PERSON> Grevers </PERSON> said. `` I did n't think this was going to happen. It's a tremendous milestone.'' <PERSON> Grevers </PERSON>, a former elder of the <ORGANIZATION> Cascade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in Grand Rapids who owns <ORGANIZATION> Fatman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Private </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Detective </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, says he has made about 30 trips behind the Iron Curtain to distribute Bibles and medicine. He says he has smuggled bibles into the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Albania </LOCATION>. `` The Bibles were taken in by car, barge, train, some with tourists. All material was given to me by various missions throughout the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> on an anonymous basis,'' he said. `` For instance, some trucks going from the West to the East would be delivering food and other goods. Some drivers would be Christians and help us,'' <PERSON> Grevers </PERSON> said. `` There are many ingenious ways you can penetrate these countries.'' <PERSON> Grevers </PERSON>, whose church is part of the Disciples of Christ denomination, said he received most of his financial backing from Amish and Mennonite churches in northern <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>. In the past year, <PERSON> Grevers </PERSON> said, he and others have been allowed to mail Bibles into the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. But <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Albania </LOCATION>, which have resisted the wave of liberalization sweeping the rest of the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc, remain difficult to penetrate, he said. `` Now we're concentrating on shipping several truckloads of medicine through our church contacts,'' he said. The medicine is distributed to <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, then sent to various Christian denominations, a Jewish group, a Roman Catholic convent and various nursing homes, he said.

 <PERSON> Eden </PERSON> <PERSON> Pastora </PERSON>, the daring Sandinista guerrilla leader known as Commander Zero who switched sides to the Contra rebels, returns Sunday to resume his fight, this time on the political field. <PERSON> Pastora </PERSON> will join others who gave up the armed struggle and now are seeking power through <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s Feb. 25 general elections. `` I am going to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> because everybody knows me and my military and political career. I am going to tell the people what is best for them. I am like the phoenix that rises from his ashes,'' he said by telephone last week from <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>. However, the arrival of the charismatic former <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> vice minister of defense is expected to add little more than spice to the campaign. <PERSON> Pastora </PERSON> has pledged to support the small <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> by attacking the two main political blocs _ the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opposition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, known as <ORGANIZATION> UNO </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> presidential candidate, is expected to finish a distant third. Independent polls and political observers give <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> an edge over the <ORGANIZATION> UNO </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Violeta </PERSON> <PERSON> Chamorro </PERSON> in his bid for re-election. But adversity will not stop the fiery <PERSON> Pastora </PERSON>, who says he has survived because <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> is on his side. `` His arrival represents an option for a solution that rejects war and Marxism and seeks to rescue the true values of the revolution that overthrew -LRB- <PERSON> Anastasio </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Somoza </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> said. Others disagree. `` The man is a guerrilla. All he knows how to do is fight. He has no political ideology,'' said <PERSON> Jaime </PERSON> <PERSON> Chamorro </PERSON>, assistant director of the opposition newspaper <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prensa </ORGANIZATION>, which backs his mother. Mrs. <PERSON> Chamorro </PERSON> is the newspaper's director. The Sandinistas hope <PERSON> Pastora </PERSON>'s charisma has worn out. <PERSON> Pastora </PERSON>, 52, has been working in <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> on a fishing cooperative with members of his former guerrilla band since 1986, when he gave up the fight. He became known worldwide Aug. 20, 1978, when he led 20 rebels in a daring assault on the National Palace. The rebels held scores of congressmen hostage until they obtained the release of 50 Sandinistas held in the prisons of then-President <PERSON> Somoza </PERSON>. Among those released was a young rebel, <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>, who went on to become president and <PERSON> Tomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Borge </PERSON>, now interior minister. A photograph of <PERSON> Pastora </PERSON> smiling and holding a rifle aloft as he boarded the plane that took his comrades out the country was a great propaganda boost for the Sandinista cause. He led the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>' southern guerrilla front and in July 1979 marched into <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> with the victorious forces to become vice minister ofdefense and one of the most popular Sandinista leaders. But <PERSON> Pastora </PERSON> always called himself a nationalist and never identified entirely with radical leftist colleagues in the Sandinista leadership. They in turn considered him a politically unstable man with more guts than brains. In 1983, <PERSON> Pastora </PERSON> disappeared from public view. Months later he announced he was taking up arms against the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>, accusing them of betraying the revolution and trying to establish a Marxist regime. <PERSON> Pastora </PERSON> organized a guerrilla force along the Costa Rican border and admitted he was getting some covert funds from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government. A master of the surprise attack, he briefly took over the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> port town of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> del </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sur </LOCATION>. In 1984, he was wounded in a bomb attempt at a jungle hideout in southern <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> during a news conference to which he had invited a large number of journalists. The <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> withdrew financial support from his group in 1986. He accused the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> of giving all its support to the Contra groups led by former <ORGANIZATION> Somoza </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> officers. `` We want a movement that is free of influence from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Pastora </PERSON> said last week. He dismissed Mrs. <PERSON> Chamorro </PERSON> as `` an honorable woman worthy of all respect, but not a politician. She is being used by the extreme right just as she was was used by the extreme left.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Chamorro </PERSON>, whose husband was murdered by the Somoza government, served on the first Sandinista junta before resigning after a year. <PERSON> Pastora </PERSON> will be able to campaign but not vote because he did not register in October.

 Just when quake-frazzled <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Franciscans </LOCATION> were recovering their equilibrium, the collapse of a construction crane and other accidents are rattling them all over again. Some are crying. Some are laughing so they wo n't cry. Quake jokes have been big on the comedy circuit since the Oct. 17 shaker, which measured 7.1 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale. Now crane jokes are starting to make the rounds after the 16-story plunge of a giant crane last Tuesday that killed five people and injured 21. It's hard to feel safe anywhere after a week when, in addition to the crane accident, a bus and train collided, killing two, and a street caved in from a broken water main. Oddball theories abound on the cause of the troubles. Astrologers claim the calamities were preordained, based on the city's `` birth date'' of Jan. 30, 1847, when the pueblo of <PERSON> Yerba </PERSON> <PERSON> Buena </PERSON> became <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. `` <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> is moving into a period of bad luck and disasters, being injured in our tenderest places, while being in a position of negative publicity and changes in our image,'' said astrologer <PERSON> Jayj </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON>. The string of bad breaks continued Friday when Mayor <PERSON> Art </PERSON> <PERSON> Agnos </PERSON> was hit by a big wave and slammed into a beach in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Agnos </PERSON>, who was on the island of <LOCATION> Maui </LOCATION> to speak about earthquake preparedness and crisis management, broke his collarbone and will need to wear a brace for two to three weeks, mayor's spokesman <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Shafer </PERSON> said. The mayor scoffs at suggestions the city is cursed, but worries that a disaster a day will keep tourists away. The recent accidents, though spectacular, did not result in a larger number of deaths or injuries than occur daily in many big cities. But <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, for all its glamour and international presence, is a relatively small place _ the population is about one-tenth that of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> _ and events are magnified. Crisis hotlines are so busy callers often are put on hold. Mental health clinics are packed with stressed-out patients, some afraid to go into tall buildings, cross bridges or ride double-decker freeways. Calls to the suicide prevention and related hotlines for people with problems such as drugs or marriage troubles were up 30 percent in the first couple of weeks after the quake, reaching about 260 a day. Though the number of calls has since eased off, the numbers do n't tell the whole story because callers in the past week have tended to be more upset on average and each takes longer to help, said <PERSON> Eve </PERSON> <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON>, executive director of <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Suicide </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prevention </ORGANIZATION>. `` The calls we've been getting this week are more intense ...,'' said <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON>. `` The events this week triggered memories of the quake. And the fact that this is happening during the start of the holiday stress season is adding to the anxiety. We've burned out a lot of volunteers in the last month.'' If comedy is tragedy plus time, as <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Alda </PERSON> observes in <PERSON> Woody </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>'s latest film, `` Crimes and Misdemeanors,'' then <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> is getting funnier every day. `` Humor is a defense mechanism,'' says comedian <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Pitta </PERSON>. `` When the quake first happened, there was nothing funny about it. There was no way I was going to make fun of the <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION> or I-880 collapse. But after a grace period, you could start telling jokes. Now so many things are happening it's ridiculous.'' <PERSON> Pitta </PERSON> suggests that `` the networks are going to keep crews out here all the time just to wait for disasters.'' The thousands of people complaining of feeling more vulnerable these days are experiencing a normal reaction, but they should seek help if the fear gets too intense or lasts more than a couple of months, psychologists say. `` Many people have had trouble sleeping or eating properly,'' said <PERSON> Rosemary </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, a social worker and psychological clinician at the Mission Crisis unit. `` But when they are unable to leave home because it's the only place they feel safe, at that point they really need to be seen on an emergency basis.'' Recent immigrants, the homeless and people dealing with personal tragedies are more severely affected psychologically by the disasters, said Dr. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Turpin </PERSON>, a psychiatrist who treats many Soviet immigrants. `` It's been really traumatic for them, especially the older and more recent immigrants,'' <PERSON> Turpin </PERSON> said. `` They still ca n't sleep well. It seems everything is still shaking.'' `` Their lives are unsettled and this exacerbates what they're already going through. One newcomer to the region has been closer to the disasters than most, but she's vowing to keep on. <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> <PERSON> Vincentz </PERSON>, a 25-year-old <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> native, was aboard a commuter train that plowed into a chartered bus Monday. The next morning, she arrived for work in the Financial District minutes after the 240-ton crane fell onto a busy street. After each accident, she called her mother in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> to assure her she was OK. `` After the earthquake, everybody in the East asked me if I was packing my bags,'' she said `` I said, ` No, it will take more than an earthquake.' And then I was on the train. So ... my mother asked if I was going to pack my bags. And I said, ` No, it will take more than that.'''

 Thousands of <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> members jeered party leader <PERSON> Egon </PERSON> <PERSON> Krenz </PERSON> on Saturday and booed his promises of change as he appeared at a rally on the eve of meeting that could lead to changes in the leadership. `` We do n't believe you anymore!'' party members shouted at <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> as he addressed the rally in front of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> building in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. The crowd booed and whistled when <PERSON> Krenz </PERSON> promised the party leadership would thoroughly investigate disclosures of massive corruption and high living among top party officials. `` Too late!'' they shouted. <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION>, 52, has been trying desperately to distance himself from the old hard-line leadership, of which he was a prominent member. He replaced party leader <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> on Oct. 18 and began a campaign to disclose abuse and purge the Old Guard. However, immediate reform efforts did not stop the exodus of thousands to the West and the huge street demonstrations. And <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION>'s support in June for <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators has been another obstacle in his effort to win over the public. <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION>'s government bowed to pressure Nov. 9 by opening East German borders and the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall to allow citizens to travel freely. He has denied living opulently, as other leaders did under <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> earlier in the day spoke to his party organization in <LOCATION> Barth </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Rostock </LOCATION>, and repeated that he was ready to resign as party leader if that was what the party rank-and-file wanted. ADN reported that several regional party leaders called for <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> and the 10-member Politburo to resign and that several thousand people also took part in opposition-organized rallies in <LOCATION> Rostock </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Magdeburg </LOCATION>. Late Saturday, 15,000 people rallied in the town of <LOCATION> Plauen </LOCATION> near the border with <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> to press for quicker reform and call for a referendum on German reunification, <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> said. The activists also expressed support for a two-hour `` warning strike'' set for Wednesday to press demands for more rapid change, <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> said. A senior Communist who said he lost faith in the leadership resigned, and party members at <LOCATION> Bergmann-Borsig </LOCATION>, a heavy industry factory in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, called for <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION>'s ouster. `` As the chairman of an election commission responsible for faking election results, <PERSON> Egon </PERSON> <PERSON> Krenz </PERSON> is unacceptable to us,'' they said in a statement published by the party newspaper <PERSON> Berliner </PERSON> <PERSON> Zeitung </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> supervised this summer's municipal elections, which officially gave the Communists an overwhelming majority. The opposition says the balloting was rigged. <PERSON> Hans-Joachim </PERSON> <PERSON> Willerding </PERSON>, a secretary of the influential <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and a non-voting member of the ruling Politburo, said he was resigning because he did not believe the current leadership could gain the stature needed to lead the drive for democratic change and economic recovery. `` Renewal is possible only when the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leads with unity and determination and with full authority,'' the official news agency <ORGANIZATION> ADA </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Willerding </PERSON> as saying. His resignation followed a tumultuous parliamentary session Friday, when lawmakers disclosed that top party officials had taken bribes, lived in luxury at state expense and stashed away more than $ 54 billion in Swiss bank accounts. <PERSON> Willerding </PERSON> said the party was in danger of collapse and called for swift action against those guilty of corruption. He was named the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>'s secretary in charge of foreign relations less than a month ago, after <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>'s government was forced to resign In another report of alleged corruption, <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> said Saturday that a secret East German operation has been shipping weapons to the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. The report said people in the town of <LOCATION> Kavelstorf </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Rostock </LOCATION>, complained that `` thousands of cases of munitions, weapons, and other military technology,'' are stored in a large metal-sided warehouse near homes in the town. ADN identified the East German operation as <ORGANIZATION> IMES </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> GmbH </ORGANIZATION> and its manager as <PERSON> Erhardt </PERSON> <PERSON> Wickert </PERSON>. It said <ORGANIZATION> IMES </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> GmbH </ORGANIZATION> came under the supervision of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s Commercial Coordination department in the Ministry of Foreign trade, headed by <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Schlack-Golodkowski </PERSON>. Foreign exchange proceeds obtained through the weapons deals were paid into the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> addressed to <LOCATION> Golodkowski </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> said. <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION> also reported that two high-ranking party officials had been arrested on suspicion of `` fraudulently damaging socialist property.'' They were identified as <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Albrecht </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> member and former party chief in the region of <LOCATION> Suhl </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON>, director of a large home construction company in <LOCATION> Suhl </LOCATION>. ADN did not give details. On Friday, the country's <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> stripped the Communists of their constitutionally guaranteed leading role in the society, abolishing their 40-year monopoly on power and clearing the way for further democratic reform. The party leadership scheduled an emergency session of the 163-member policy-making <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> for Sunday that could show how much support <ORGANIZATION> Krenz </ORGANIZATION> has going into a key party congress Dec. 15-17. Communist Premier <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Modrow </PERSON>, in an interview released Saturday by the West German news magazine <ORGANIZATION> Der </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Spiegel </ORGANIZATION>, said the Communists could win no more than 20 percent of the vote if elections were held now.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, at a summit meeting abbreviated by stormy winds and high seas, presented <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> on Saturday with a wide-ranging plan to speed work on arms control treaties and lower trade barriers to help <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s ailing economy, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said The Soviet leader made no immediate response to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposals, officials added, although both sides said the first day of talks went smoothly `` Things went well. They talked about everything: arms, <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, philosophical questions,'' Soviet spokesman <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> said after five hours of discussions. Later came the embarrassing announcement that weather had stranded <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> aboard his ship _ the <ORGANIZATION> USS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Belknap </ORGANIZATION> _ within view of the luxury liner Maxim Gorky where <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> awaited him for afternoon talks. The session was scrubbed, along with dinner. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> recommended that next year's proposed summit in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> _ the target date for signing a pact for deep cuts in long range nuclear weapons _ be held in late June, and called for speedy work on a treaty to reduce conventional forces in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. They added that the trade proposals included granting the Soviets observer status at a 97-nation international trade organization, conditioned on loosened Soviet emigration policies. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also urged <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to resolve the problems of divided families in 1990 and gave him a list of names of people that he recommended should be granted emigration rights, officials said. Officials, speaking on condition of anonymity, said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> complained about the continued delivery of Soviet-made weapons through third countries to leftist rebels in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, saying it was the most destructive element of superpower relations. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> replied he did n't know how the arms were getting to the rebels. The two leaders were smiling and in high spirits as they began their session, clasping hands across a long rectangular table that measured barely a yard across. `` It's so narrow that if we do n't have enough arguments, we'll kick each other,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> told <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> If the schedule holds, the two leaders will end their summit early Sunday afternoon and depart from this storm-tossed <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> island, with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> heading for <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> to brief <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> allies and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> flying to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to report to <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact leaders. Soviet officials, told that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was putting out its side of the story, said they would wait until Sunday to react publicly. But earlier, senior Soviet officials said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> wanted the summit to produce a timetable for completing U.S.-Soviet treaties on reducing strategic nuclear weapons, conventional forces in central <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and chemical weapons. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> recommended that Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> and Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> meet next month to resolve key obstacles to a treaty to slash long-range nuclear weapons by up to 50 percent, officials said. On another arms front, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact should conclude a treaty to reduce conventional forces in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> next year and sign the agreement at an international summit in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, the officials added. And, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he would be willing to halt production of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> chemical weapons once an international treaty is reach to ban poison gas. On the economic front, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> promised anew to lift trade restrictions against the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> once it enacts legislation to ease emigration barriers, the officials said. If that condition is met, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would support Soviet participation as an observer at an international trade forum, the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-. He also called on <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to join him in recommending <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> as the site for the Olympic Games in 2004, officials said, a gesture that would dramatize the changes taking place in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, stuck with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on the <PERSON> Belknap </PERSON>, issued a statement from the cruiser saying the president thought the talks had been `` extremely productive.'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> seemed unperturbed by the foul weather and scrambled schedule, escorted his wife, <PERSON> Raisa </PERSON>, on a tour of the Maxim Gorky. The Gorbachevs spent several minutes in a shipboard ballroom and then poked their heads into the adjacent library. Outside, three wind surfers showed off by darting around the bay while <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was stranded. A printed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> statement said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> opened the morning meeting with an hour-long presentation, proposing more than a dozen ideas for economic and political progress in U.S.-Soviet relations. It said the talks ranged from the economic situation in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> to arms control and <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, and added that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> spoke at length about perestroika, his program of economic restructuring, and the goals of his reform program. `` The meetings were sparked by a spirit of forward-looking cooperation during these increasingly charged times,'' said the White House statement. `` They recognized that economic and political challenges were ahead for <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, and vowed to consider the opportunities presented with sensitivity and firm initiative.'' `` The first thing to do is eliminate those types of ships which you can not board in this kind of weather,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> joked to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as he welcomed him aboard. `` We will have a secret agenda in this way to disarm the -LRB- <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> -RRB- Sixth Fleet,'' the Soviet leader said with a laugh. The Soviets are serious, however, in pressing the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to agree to reductions in naval forces as part of arms control negotiations and to remove nuclear weapons from the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> zone. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> braved the choppy seas in a small launch to get to the Soviet liner, and then ran into trouble when he returned to his command ship, the cruiser USS Belknap, also anchored about 500 yards from land. His launch had to make four passes at the <PERSON> Belknap </PERSON> before he could board. A White House statement later said the obvious: `` The 60 miles per hour winds preclude any movements off the ship this evening, but they have made for a very exciting afternoon sail.'' Asked by reporters if they would reach any achievements, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> replied, `` da, da -LRB- yes, yes -RRB-.'' On what? he was asked. `` Mnogovo,'' which was translated as meaning `` a lot of things.'' Asked the same question, the president echoed <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. `` Mnogovo,'' he said. The two leaders met in the plush surroundings of a library-like room known as the Card Room, next to the ship's lounge and nightclub, on the Maxim Gorky's promenade deck. They sat in deep captain's chairs, accompanied by aides on either side. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who had spent the night on the storm-buffeted <PERSON> Belknap </PERSON>, said he had not been bothered by the rough weather. `` Piece of cake,'' he said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> began with an expanded meeting that included at least 16 people and then held a one-on-one session, with note takers, that lasted about 1 -LCB- hours. That was followed by a working lunch, after which <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> returned to the Belknap.

<TEXT>
 A London-bound <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> 747 with 133 people aboard lost cabin pressure at 37,000 feet and dived for several minutes before returning safely to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, officials said. The decompression of Flight 120 Friday afternoon began with a bang and was followed by a cold rush of air and automatic deployment of oxygen masks, passengers said. No one was injured and the cause was not immediately known. `` We were very scared,'' said <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Hinckley </PERSON>, a tourist from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>. `` We went down so fast that we were pressed back flat against out seats. We could hear the wind rushing and it suddenly got freezing cold.'' The pilot, whose name was withheld by the airline, followed standard emergency procedures by diving to a lower altitude where the crew and passengers could breathe without oxygen masks. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> and the airline were investigating, said an <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> regional officer who declined to give his name. The airliner left <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> shortly after noon Friday and was heading east at an announced cruising altitude of 37,000 feet when it lost pressure, passengers said. `` The scariest thing was that we were dropping for three or four minutes and they never told us that we were going to level off,'' said <PERSON> Jal </PERSON> <PERSON> Haemel </PERSON>, a member of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> international sailing team on his way to a competition in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The jumbo jet eventually leveled off and the pilot informed passengers they would be returning to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. Passengers were offered spots on a later flight Friday night.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> appealed to Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> during their summit talks Saturday to halt the flow of Soviet weapons to rebels in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, but <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said the issue was not resolved. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, according to the officials, said he did not know how the arms get to the Central American country. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> alleges that the weapons, including Soviet anti-aircraft launchers, are channeled through the leftist governments of <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. A plane that crashed last weekend in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> carried a cache of Soviet weapons, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> charged. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials at the summit, declining to be identified, called the dispute the biggest stumbling block to a further improvement in superpower relations. Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> last week denounced the weapons flow as a `` relic of the Cold War.'' He had taken the issue up in September with Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard A. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> in Jackson Hole, <LOCATION> Wyo </LOCATION>. The Soviets promised at that time to stop direct deliveries and to try to stem the flow, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said. The Salavadoran rebels are using the arms in their war against a U.S.-backed, right-wing government. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration, meanwhile, refuses to stop providing weapons to rebels fighting a Marxist government in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has ruled out a tradeoff with <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> halting Soviet arms for Salvadoran rebels and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arms to the Afghans.

<HEAD>Delay Reported in Start of Search for Lost Commuter Plane</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WESTERLY, R.I. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The search for a commuter plane that disappeared off <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> last week was delayed at least 20 minutes until somebody at the Westerly airport noticed it was late, a newspaper reported Saturday. Eight people were aboard when the plane presumably crashed into Block Island Sound while flying the 17 miles from the island to Westerly on Tuesday. The <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> gave up searching for survivors Wednesday night after finding debris and two dead dogs from the plane. <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> officials said investigators had not recovered the plane, but were compiling various evidence, including records showing the aircraft underwent extensive repairs for a crack three years ago. Officials planned to use sonar Monday to scan the ocean floor for debris. New England Airlines President <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bendokas </PERSON> told The <ORGANIZATION> Providence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal-Bulletin </ORGANIZATION> the search was delayed because ticket agents at Westerly did not realize the flight had not arrived until 7 p.m., when they called him at home and said it was 20 minutes overdue. The pilots commonly fuel and unload planes before checking in with the terminal desk, he said. <PERSON> Bendokas </PERSON> said he called the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> at 7:15 p.m., alhough <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferreira </PERSON>, manager of the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> center at Quonset Point, said his logs show the call coming in at 7:35 p.m. <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> records from the agency's <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> office indicate the airplane underwent repairs for a crack on July 1, 1986. Seventeen separate steps were taken to fix the hole, said <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitfield </PERSON>. `` The company was doing more maintenance than required by the manufacturer'' on the 1969 model <PERSON> Britten-Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Islander </PERSON>, said <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Pollock </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Pollock </PERSON> said an examination of a dog that was accompanying one of the missing passengers indicated the animal drowned. He would not speculate whether that meant the airplane broke up when it hit the water. Seas were 5 to 6 feet and water temperatures about 45 degrees, making survival unlikely for anyone in the water. The plane was not tracked on air traffic control radar and there were no radio calls for help before the crash, <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopatkiewicz </PERSON> said. Since older commuter planes normally do n't carry the `` black box'' flight recorders that are on larger commercial airliners, the <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> said investigators were piecing together other evidence, including the pilot's background. Pilot <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Beck </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, 46, had flown part-time for the airline for about six months, <PERSON> Bendokas </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Beck </PERSON> previously flew for the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> and for about 10 years with area charter operations, he said.

 Soviet spokesmen expressed satisfaction Saturday after five hours of talks in which <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> advocated a quicker timetable for completion of nuclear and conventional arms treaties next year and edged toward a chemical arms deal. `` Things went well,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s spokesman <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> told reporters who waited in vain aboard the Soviet passenger liner <PERSON> Maksim </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorky </PERSON> for an afternoon session. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was forced to postpone the meeting and a dinner because gale force winds prevented him from leaving the USS Belknap, anchored a few hundreds yards offshore from the Gorky, which was tied ashore. `` They talked about everything, arms, <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, philosophical questions,'' <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> said of the morning and luncheon talks. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> suggested that the two men meet again in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in the last two weeks of June, said a White House offical who spoke on condition of anonymity. And the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> president reiterated his commitment, which is shared by <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, that they should use the occasion to sign a treaty to slash superpower strategic nuclear aresenals by 30 to 50 percent, to 6,000 warheads apiece. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> planned to brief his <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> allies Monday in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> on the summit, said Soviet officials, but it was unclear whether problems with the weather here would delay that meeting. For the first time, a non-communist _ Polish Prime Minister <PERSON> Tadeusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> _ likely will sit around the table with <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact leaders. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> was pressing <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for greater speed on the strategic arms treaty, said <PERSON> Vitaly </PERSON> <PERSON> Churkin </PERSON>, a spokesman for Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> also wanted a commitment from <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to attend a proposed 35-nation summit of <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> leaders in late 1990 to sign a pact, now under negotiation, to remove 30,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and 325,000 Soviet troops from <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The White House spokesmen said that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had proposed completing the deal and signing it at a summit of the 23 <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact alliance members at a summit in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, last next year. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> also appeared successful in prodding <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> toward an agreement to curb or eliminate <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet chemical weapons. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> proposed at the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> in September that the superpowers cut their chemical arms by 80 percent, but the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would continue to produce a new generation of chemical weapons. The bilateral treaty would be intended to build momentum for a 40-nation accord to eliminate chemical weapons over 10 years. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would destroy all its chemical arms by that deadline if all chemical-capable nations did likewise and signed the accord, but administation officials that American would retain 2 percent of its stockpiles through the 10th year. The White House official said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> now was willing to drop the idea of continuing chemical weapons production, and that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would stop making a new generation of chemical weapons as soon as a multi-lateral agreement to ban such weapons take effect. The leaders also agreed to schedule two or three arms control meetings between between Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> and <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>, the first in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in January and the next at a multinational meeting in <LOCATION> Ottawa </LOCATION> in February. A Soviet media commentator, <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Posner </PERSON>, said it was possible that the summit would stretch into late Sunday to cope with the interruption Saturday, but stressed he was not speaking for the Kremlin. Such a delay might force postponement of the planned meeting in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> of <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact leaders, convening amid sweeping changes in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> that the Soviet officials said would require a restructuring of the Soviet-led military alliance, which was formed in 1955 in response to the creation of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>. In the past, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and other Soviet leaders have met with the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leaders of the six <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> members, but the dissolution of the Hungarian party and the creation of a Solidarity-led government in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> has complicated the process, said the officials. `` It is now up to the countries to decide who to send to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>,'' said a Soviet official. `` It will be the bosses as usual.'' <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, for example, is likely to send President <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader, and <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON>, the Solidarity official who last August formed the first non-Communist government in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bloc </LOCATION>. The communists retain control of the defense and internal security minstries. The reorganization of the alliance, however, will not be settled Monday. `` It's a hot period now. We need to wait until the situation sorts itself out in these countries,'' said one official. `` The future of the blocs must be discussed'' by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, said the official, who minimized talk of a reunified <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> along the lines proposed last week by German Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>. `` They should work on the basis of two Germanies for the foreseeable future,'' said the official. `` That means as long as you can see.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has said he will not negotiate the future of <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 The opposition made strong gains in the island's first multiparty elections and handed the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> an embarrassing defeat in the hometown of <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s president, according to election results Sunday. Ballot-rigging and noisy protests marred Saturday's election, the first national vote since the <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> lifted martial law in 1987. The Nationalists have been in power since they fled to <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> following their 1949 defeat by the Communists in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s civil war Thousands of angry opposition supporters surrounded government office buildings in several cities Saturday, calling for recounts or demanding results. Protesters broke windows in one city. The opposition <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> claimed `` a great victory.'' With nearly all districts reporting, the Nationalists were garnering 55 percent of the popular vote, while the opposition won about 35 percent. The rest went to independents. `` This is a setback for the Nationalists,'' said <PERSON> Ting </PERSON> <PERSON> Tin-yu </PERSON>, a professor of sociology. `` They should have won 70 percent of the vote.'' In 1986 elections, the opposition won 22 percent of the vote campaigning as independents. In the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION>, the opposition won 21 seats; it previously held 12. The Nationalists won 72 seats. In county and mayoral races, the opposition won six posts, up from two before the vote. The Nationalists won 14. One seat went to an independent allied with the opposition. An opposition faction that ran on an illegal campaign platform calling for an end to <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s claim on the Communist mainland also polled well. In a slap in the face to the Nationalists, opposition candidate <PERSON> You </PERSON> <PERSON> Ching </PERSON>, a 47-year-old legislator, won the executive post in <LOCATION> Taipei </LOCATION> <LOCATION> county </LOCATION>, President <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Teng-hui </PERSON>'s hometown. The president is a symbol of Nationalist power. `` One of the first things I will do is demolish the <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> headquarters,'' You told a screaming crowd early Sunday. `` Then you will be able to walk your dogs on the property.'' Tens of thousands of revelers celebrated You's victory in what the local press had dubbed `` the war of the century.'' Supporters set off firecrackers and danced in the streets near You's campaign headquarters in <LOCATION> Panchiao </LOCATION>. In all, 722 candidates ran in the legislative, mayoral and county executive races. The Nationalists can not lose power in the election. The 256-seat Legislature and the electoral college are dominated by elderly Nationalists elected for life on the Chinese mainland in the late 1940s and frozen in office to support the party's claim to be the legitimate government of all <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. Still, the vote is of tremendous importance to this highly-industrialized island of 20 million, considered an economic miracle in <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. It is the first nationwide election since 38 years of martial law ended in 1987 and the first with a legal opposition. It is also the first to witness relatively open debate on taboo subjects such as <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> independence and official corruption. At least 20 of 32 candidates of the opposition <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Country </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> won seats in a variety of races. One member, the widow of a dissident who committed suicide to avoid prosecution for his beliefs, got one of highest vote tallies in the election. Another woman, whose husband has been jailed on political charges, also won. Even those who chose Nationalists had a preference for change. Two crusading reformers from the liberal wing of the party polled the highest in southern and northern <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>. Reports of vote-buying were widespread. Several voters in <LOCATION> Taipei </LOCATION> on Saturday told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> they had been paid for their votes. The going rate was $ 19. Earlier Saturday, the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> said it was investigating scores of reports of voter intimidation and ballot rigging. Angry crowds surrounded county government buildings in <LOCATION> Nantou </LOCATION>, in central <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Tainan </LOCATION>, in the south, alleging that the <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> had cheated at the polls. In <LOCATION> Tainan </LOCATION>, a rowdy crowd smashed windows at the government offices and beat government officials, the state-run radio said. Protests also broke out in <LOCATION> Taichung </LOCATION> in central <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>. But police said crowds dispersed Sunday. The opposition's campaign focused on the local, rather than legislative, elections. `` We can not control the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION>, but we can rule the local governments,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Chang </PERSON> Chun-hung. In <LOCATION> Kaohsiung </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Hsu </PERSON> <PERSON> Hsiao-dan </PERSON>, a dancer who used nude pictures of herself as campaign posters, lost. She ran a campaign based on love and freedom.

 As leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> prepare to meet to set policy on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> health-care issues, some members are questioning how well the group is running itself after recent revelations about money-losing deals. The <ORGANIZATION> AMA </ORGANIZATION> is coping with a controversy involving an executive's pension losses in a high-risk stock market fund and a loan to another executive who defaulted The disclosures have shaken the conservative image of the Chicago-based <ORGANIZATION> AMA </ORGANIZATION>, which with 300,000 members is the nation's largest organization for doctors `` It's a huge embarrassment to us, to the profession and to the organization,'' said one <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> doctor and <ORGANIZATION> AMA </ORGANIZATION> member who spoke on condition of anonymity. `` We are concerned about our image because so much of medicine is based on trust.'' A resolution calling for the <ORGANIZATION> AMA </ORGANIZATION>'s top executive to step aside during an investigation is expected to go this week to the group's <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Delegates </ORGANIZATION> The policy-setting body is meeting in <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> Sunday through Wednesday to consider a host of other issues as well, including patients' rights and funding for AIDS care. Last month, four <ORGANIZATION> AMA </ORGANIZATION> affiliates passed resolutions concerning revelations that Executive Vice President Dr. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sammons </PERSON> had approved two money-losing deals for other top association executives. Making the matter even more painful, doctors say, is that <PERSON> Sammons </PERSON> is widely admired within the association as an eloquent and effective spokesman and has been credited with saving the <ORGANIZATION> AMA </ORGANIZATION> from financial disaster when he took the job in 1974. The <ORGANIZATION> AMA </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trustees </ORGANIZATION>, after receiving a report from the law firm doing the investigation, issued its own report Saturday concluding <PERSON> Sammons </PERSON> had `` acted within the scope of his authority.'' The report, which will go to delegates for ratification this week, also said the board will restructure its committees and hire a new outside auditing firm to try to provide the type of accountability sought in the affiliates' resolutions. The trustees declined to comment on the report. In 1987, <PERSON> Sammons </PERSON> approved a $ 353,000 reimbursement to Chief Operating Officer <PERSON> Whalen </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Strobhar </PERSON> for losses he suffered in the `` Black Monday'' stock market crash. <PERSON> Sammons </PERSON> said he ordered the reimbursement after <PERSON> Strohbar </PERSON> reported that his $ 1.4 million in pension funds was moved by mistake from relatively safe money-market funds to high-risk but potentially more lucrative investments. Two years later, <PERSON> Sammons </PERSON> reversed his decision after <ORGANIZATION> AMA </ORGANIZATION> attorneys said the transfer of funds before the Oct. 19, 1987, market crash was not a mistake but a `` deliberate act.'' When the deal was reported in a <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sun-Times </ORGANIZATION> investigation in October, <PERSON> Strobhar </PERSON>, 57, resigned and agreed to repay with interest what he acknowledged was an `` inappropriate'' reimbursement. In the second deal, the <ORGANIZATION> AMA </ORGANIZATION> lost $ 50,000 on a $ 267,000 loan <PERSON> Sammons </PERSON> approved in May 1985 to help another top executive buy a luxury condominium while he was going through a divorce. <ORGANIZATION> AMA </ORGANIZATION> counsel <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said there was nothing unusual about the loan to <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Noffke </PERSON>, 42, then deputy executive vice president in charge of real estate and other financial affairs. But <PERSON> Noffke </PERSON> defaulted on the loan, forcing the <ORGANIZATION> AMA </ORGANIZATION> to foreclose and costing it $ 50,000. Several months after the loan, <PERSON> Noffke </PERSON> lost his $ 187,500-a-year job in a management reorganization. The revelations about <PERSON> Strobhar </PERSON>'s stock market loss prompted the <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> to call for the investigation of <ORGANIZATION> AMA </ORGANIZATION> financial practices, as well as a review of the association's administrative structure The doctors' societies of <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> asked for a curtailment of the broad financial discretion of the chief executive. The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Sammons </PERSON> should be put on administrative leave until the investigation is closed. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Meister </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Delaware </ORGANIZATION>, said his group's resolution was n't meant to express a lack of confidence in the <ORGANIZATION> AMA </ORGANIZATION> or <PERSON> Sammons </PERSON>. He said the society is urging establishment of a system of financial accountability and checks and balances so the chief executive wo n't be solely responsible for non-budget disbursements such as those made to <LOCATION> Strobhar </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Noffke </PERSON>.

 An Episcopalian minister and eight members of his church detained two weeks ago were charged with helping leftist rebels and transferred to prison, a human rights group said Saturday. Americas Watch, the human rights group, said the nine Salvadorans who had been in police custody since Nov. 19-20were transferred to prison to await trial after charges were filed against them Friday. The human rights group, which is based in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, made the statement from its office in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. There was sporadic shooting in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>'s northern <LOCATION> Mejicanos </LOCATION> district early Saturday, but it ended by daylight and military officials said the capital was quiet. The rebels launched a major offensive three weeks ago, attacking numerous targets in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. The military press office said 19 guerrillas and 10 soldiers were killed in clashes Friday in <LOCATION> Mejicanos </LOCATION> and the eastern <LOCATION> Soyapango </LOCATION> district. More than 1,000 people were reported killed during the rebels' offensive. Business activity was generally normal in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> on Saturday, and crews were repairing eletrical lines destroyed by the guerrillas. The Rev. <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Serrano </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorente </PERSON> and eight members of his Episcopal church, including its lawyer and social programs directors, were arrested in police raids Nov. 19 and 20. They are accused of allowing rebels to hide trucks loaded with homemade mortars at their church the night before an Oct. 30 attack on the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>. Mortar shells were fired from two trucks, killing a gas station attendant working near the ministry compound and wounding 15 people. Sources at <PERSON> Serrano </PERSON>'s church told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> that armed guerrillas forced their way into the church compound on Oct. 29 and spent the night there. They said none of the church members was a participant in the mortar attack. The government has accused Salvadoran and foreign workers involved in church and human-rights organizations of supporting the rebels. President <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> on Friday referred to the rebels' <ORGANIZATION> Farabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> as a `` minority joined by internationalists who come here to murder Salvadorans.

 A man accused of helping his wife kill a couple in order to take their 9-day-old son was acquitted Saturday on all counts in the Christmas Eve 1987 kidnap-slaying. Jurors returned the innocent verdicts after more than three days of deliberations in the case of <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON>. <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON> claimed his wife, <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON>, had duped him into thinking she was pregnant, and that he was unaware the child he thought was <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> was not their child. `` Oh Daddy, it's over,'' the defendant said as he embraced his father after court was adjourned. <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON> was found guilty in June of killing <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> and <PERSON> Beverly </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Hazletteville </LOCATION>, snatching their infant son, <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON>, and trying to pass him off as her own. She was sentenced to life in prison without possibility of parole. At her trial, Mrs. <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON> had argued unsuccessfully that her husband controlled her by injecting her with overdoses of a strong painkiller and that she thought the killings were all a dream. The victims' parents avoided reporters after Saturday's verdict. But the Rev. <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Valentine </PERSON>, a spokesman for the families, said they were shocked by the decision, which he called `` a nightmare.'' `` It's hard for us to fathom that one person could have done all that they did _ murdered two people, kidnapped a baby, Christmas Eve morning at 1:30 or so,'' he said. Asked outside the courthouse if he planned to divorce his wife, <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON> said, `` More than likely.'' Concerning the <ORGANIZATION> Gibsons </ORGANIZATION>, he said, `` I feel sorry for what happened. Ai n't nothing I can do to change it.'' Prosecutors accused the couple of stalking <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON>, 32, and his wife, 27, for at least a week before gunning then down at the mobile home on Dec. 24, 1987, and then taking the infant. The <ORGANIZATION> Gibsons </ORGANIZATION>' 5-year-old daughter and 1-year-old son were not hurt. When the Lynches were arrested Jan. 7, 1988, they still had <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON>, whom they referred to as their son <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>. Police found them by tracing telephone calls from their <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Del. </LOCATION>, home to the <ORGANIZATION> Gibsons </ORGANIZATION>' home.

<HEAD>Investigator To Question Subcontractor in San Francisco Crane Collapse</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The investigation of a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> crane collapse that killed five people will explore possible criminal wrongdoing by a subcontractor for rehiring a crane operator after he made nearly `` catastrophic'' mistakes, a newspaper reported Saturday. In <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION>, meanwhile, it was reported that the subcontractor had been cited for safety violations four times in the past four months. <ORGANIZATION> Erection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> executives will be questioned about the work and medical history of operator <PERSON> Lonnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Boggess </PERSON>, who died in the accident, <LOCATION> Hamilton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fairburn </LOCATION>, deputy chief of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Occupational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, told the <ORGANIZATION> Seattle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post-Intelligencer </ORGANIZATION> Any criminal involvement `` would depend on why they rehired him and what evidence they had at that time to feel assured that he was OK,'' <LOCATION> Fairburn </LOCATION> said. Newspapers have reported that <PERSON> Boggess </PERSON> said in a sworn statement last summer in his divorce case that he was upset over a custody dispute and made job mistakes that nearly caused `` catastrophic injury to fellow employees.'' <PERSON> Boggess </PERSON> had tried to commit suicide twice during the past nine months and had been hospitalized for psychiatric observation twice since March, according to court documents obtained by <ORGANIZATION> McClatchy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspapers </ORGANIZATION>. There also have been published reports that <PERSON> Boggess </PERSON> had a history of alcohol problems, as well as suggestions that he may have suffered a heart attack at the time of the accident. <PERSON> Boggess </PERSON> did n't report for work between April and October, according to employees of his union. If the firm laid him off because of his mental state, it `` would have to show how he was able to return to work,'' <LOCATION> Fairburn </LOCATION> said. The cab of the crane made a sudden 180-degree turn Tuesday while the crane's height was being increased from 16 to 20 stories at the construction site of a new high-rise. <LOCATION> Fairburn </LOCATION> said investigators are focusing on human error as the likely cause of the crane collapse, which showered tons of steel on the city's busy financial district. It takes deliberate action to release the `` dead man's switch,'' which locks the crane in place, <LOCATION> Fairburn </LOCATION> said. Investigators still have n't ruled out a mechanical failure, though, he added. The cab, along with other parts of the crane, has been taken to an undisclosed yard where it will be studied by experts. <LOCATION> Fairburn </LOCATION> said he is aware of published reports that <PERSON> Boggess </PERSON> had a history of alcohol and drug abuse and has asked the coroner to speed a toxicology report. Coroner's officials have said blood alcohol test results will be available in about two weeks. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanley </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> OSHA </ORGANIZATION> office in <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION> said state inspectors have cited <ORGANIZATION> Erection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> four times and fined it $ 1,500 since Aug. 4 for work on a $ 122 million, 22-story building in that city, The <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> reported Saturday. The company was cited for not requiring a worker to wear a safety belt, failing to provide adequate safety platforms for workers, failing to post safety rules at the site and carrying out hazardous crane operations by lifting more than one steel beam at a time. The first citation came after an ironworker fell 35 feet and was injured while welding at the site. Earlier this week, the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state, where Erection is based and <PERSON> Boggess </PERSON> lived, said the subcontractor had been cited 20 times for safety violations in the past three years, including once for a fatal accident and four times for accidents involving injuries. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> regulators have fined the company $ 117,610 since the beginning of 1987 but Erection is appealing six cases representing $ 99,770 of the fines.

 An affluent accountant whose wife was strangled last week was ordered to cooperate in the murder investigation by giving fingernail scrapings, blood and hair samples to authorities. The order Friday by <ORGANIZATION> Cabell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Hanlon </PERSON> came several hours before a land company sued <PERSON> Lyle </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> McGinnis </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, 42, charging he swindled the company out of more than $ 5.64 million since 1980 and set a fire in his office to destroy the evidence. <ORGANIZATION> Nighbert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Land </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, which handles coal leases in <LOCATION> Mingo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, alleged that <PERSON> McGinnis </PERSON> also took $ 649,000 from a corporate stock account he established for <PERSON> Nighbert </PERSON>. <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> McGinnis </PERSON> was found dead behind a St. Albans shopping center Wednesday afternoon, 15 hours after apparently being strangled at her home in <LOCATION> Huntington </LOCATION>. Police did not find <PERSON> Lyle </PERSON> <PERSON> McGinnis </PERSON> until 36 hours later, when he was involved in a single-car accident in eastern <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>. <PERSON> McGinnis </PERSON> did not return telephone calls left at his house or at his parents' home Friday. <LOCATION> Cabell </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff <PERSON> Ottie </PERSON> <PERSON> Adkins </PERSON> said <PERSON> McGinnis </PERSON> has refused to talk to officers on the advice of his attorney. Police visited <PERSON> McGinnis </PERSON> in an <LOCATION> Ashland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, hospital after the accident to question him about his wife's slaying, but allowed him to be released when he would n't answer questions. `` His attorney was down there last night, but he did n't want to make any comment,'' <PERSON> Adkins </PERSON> said Friday. The sheriff would n't say whether <PERSON> McGinnis </PERSON> was a suspect. State police and sheriff's officials from <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> pored over <PERSON> McGinnis </PERSON>' car Friday to look for evidence. <PERSON> Nighbert </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrell </PERSON>, said <PERSON> McGinnis </PERSON> purchased an interest in the land company in 1979 or 1980 and was named its accountant in early 1980. Beginning that same year, he allegedly diverted money to himself, his business or a joint account with his wife, <PERSON> Farrell </PERSON> said. In addition, the lawsuit said, <PERSON> McGinnis </PERSON> failed to pay <PERSON> Nighbert </PERSON>'s taxes since 1980, prompting federal officials to seize the company's assets <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> agents were to look over the records Aug. 22, but the documents were lost in an Aug. 20 fire at <PERSON> McGinnis </PERSON>' office. `` <PERSON> McGinnis </PERSON> caused a fire to be set for the purpose of destroying <PERSON> Nighbert </PERSON> records,'' the lawsuit said. The lawsuit seeks the return of $ 5 million and punitive damages of $ 10 million. It also seeks any additional money that might be found and asks that <PERSON> McGinnis </PERSON> be forced to pay any federal or state penalties. <PERSON> Nighbert </PERSON> fired <PERSON> McGinnis </PERSON> in October, <PERSON> Farrell </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Nighbert </PERSON> obtained an injunction prohibiting <PERSON> McGinnis </PERSON> from disposing of any of his assets, which <PERSON> Farrell </PERSON> said included a jet and several cars. Court records show <PERSON> McGinnis </PERSON> in June 1986 paid $ 495,500 for an elaborate home just east of <LOCATION> Huntington </LOCATION> and held other property in the county. In the August fire, <PERSON> McGinnis </PERSON> said robbers broke into his office, tied him to a chair and set a fire. There were signs of a scuffle, but police did not close the books on that case.

<TEXT>
 This <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> suburb's city council changed its mind and agreed to seek a sister city in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> even though many residents made it clear they consider the Cold War far from over. Council members voted 5-2 to endorse a program that will provide for student, cultural and business exchanges with a Soviet city to be determined later, according to The Dallas Morning News. `` I think the city council should be proud of themselves,'' <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Weidman </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Plano </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sister </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said after Friday's vote. `` They came through and in my estimate did what was right.'' Nevertheless, most of the more than 40 people who spoke on the issue before the council vote opposed the plan. <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said he still believes Communists are out to dominate the world despite the recent liberalization sweeping across <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. `` This is part of the most massive propaganda campaign, which we swallow hook, line and sinker,'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said. `` If <LOCATION> Plano </LOCATION> becomes part of this program, we are approving of the Communist government by adding the city of <LOCATION> Plano </LOCATION> stamp of approval.'' Councilman <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Teague </PERSON>, who opposed the measure, said there has been `` too much sacrifice and too much loss to just forgive and forget.'' `` I'm about as excited as anybody else about the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall, but what's been torn down can be built back up.'' The council had rejected a similar proposal seven months ago. Several members who changed their minds said they were influenced by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cities </ORGANIZATION> meeting last week in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. The preservation of the human spirit was stressed at the conference, `` and a new spirit needs to be generated,'' Councilman <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON> said. `` This is a good chance for us to do that.''

<TEXT>
 A correspondent for a Spanish-language radio network who was reporting from <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> was last heard from early last week and a network official said Saturday he feared the reporter was dead. <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON> <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON> had not be in contact with <ORGANIZATION> Cadena </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Centro </ORGANIZATION> since Tuesday, said <PERSON> Barrett </PERSON> <PERSON> Alley </PERSON>, president of the Dallas-based network that provides programming for 26 affiliates in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` If a foreign correspondent has n't filed -LRB- a story -RRB- in four full days, then there's a problem,'' <PERSON> Alley </PERSON> said. The 44-year-old reporter was staying at a hotel in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, but had checked out early Tuesday after interviewing top government officials, including President <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON>. <PERSON> Alley </PERSON> said <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON> called in seven stories and was not heard from again. `` We believe his last call may have been from somewhere other than the hotel,'' said <PERSON> Alley </PERSON>, who was in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> for business. The news agency has contacted the Embassy of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, and the press officer at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, but have yet to get any responses, said <PERSON> Alley </PERSON>. Officials with the Embassy of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> were not available for comment. Calls to the embassy were not answered. <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON> left for the war-torn Central American country Nov. 25 after leftist rebels mounted an offensive in the nation's capital of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. More than 70,000 people have been killed in the conflict between leftist guerrillas and the U.S.-supported government, the majority of them civilians. <PERSON> Gilberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Cortez </PERSON>, news director for the agency, said in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> he is trying to stay positive about his colleague's condition. <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON> had not registered with the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> there or with military authorities, a standard procedure for journalists in foreign countries. `` He had orders to register and he had all the proper press credentials,'' <PERSON> Cortez </PERSON> said. `` What I believe is that maybe he got involved too deep with the information he is sending us.'' <PERSON> Cortez </PERSON> said <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON> is the operations manager for the agency, but was sent to cover reaction of the uprising because the agency was short-staffed and <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON> has extensive experience as a reporter. <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON> had interviewed a number of government officials, including defense and health ministers, over four days, <PERSON> Cortez </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON> was born in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, and is a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizen whose home is in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>. He has worked for the radio network since its inception 3 -LCB- years ago. <ORGANIZATION> Cadena </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Centro </ORGANIZATION> provides 18 Spanish newscasts a day to affiliates across the country, including radio stations in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. The network also provides music programming and sports information.

<TEXT>
 The bosom-baring models at Yves Saint <PERSON> Laurent </PERSON> and the very proper late Duchess of <LOCATION> Windsor </LOCATION> had one thing in common _ perfectly coiffed tresses cared for by <PERSON> Alexandre </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Paris </PERSON>. His hairstyles add zing to styles shown at nearly every major fashion show in town _ from <LOCATION> Saint </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Laurent </LOCATION> to <ORGANIZATION> Chanel </ORGANIZATION> and from <PERSON> Jean-Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Scherrer </PERSON> to <PERSON> Emanuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ungaro </PERSON>. During the shows, <PERSON> Alexandre </PERSON> and 20 assistants turn out everything from `` snail'' chignons to lion locks on hundreds of models. `` I have to know what's going on in the designers' minds,'' said <PERSON> Alexandre </PERSON> during an interview in his office above the salon on the Champs Elysees. `` I ca n't just play the matador with hair. It has to be a logical part of fashion.'' Known as king of coiffeurs, <PERSON> Alexandre </PERSON> also performs at royal marriages such as Princess <PERSON> Caroline </PERSON>'s first big wedding in <LOCATION> Monaco </LOCATION>. He is on constant call for friends like <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sophia </PERSON> <PERSON> Loren </PERSON>. He admires <PERSON> Loren </PERSON> `` who actually does her own hair almost every day.'' Born <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexandre </PERSON> <PERSON> Raimondi </PERSON> to a family of vintners in the <LOCATION> Riviera </LOCATION> seaport of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tropez </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Alexandre </PERSON> started cutting hair in 1938 when he was 15, working for <PERSON> Antoine </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Cannes </LOCATION> hairdresser who was known as <ORGANIZATION> Coco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chanel </ORGANIZATION>'s favorite. <PERSON> Alexandre </PERSON> was encouraged by the bushy-haired writer <PERSON> Colette </PERSON>, a neighbor and friend of his grandmother `` who talked about <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> all the time. I knew I had to go there.'' After World War II, he met the <PERSON> Begum </PERSON> and the Duchess of <LOCATION> Windsor </LOCATION>, who insisted he come to <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, and he transferred his salon. <PERSON> Alexandre </PERSON> kept <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Cocteau </PERSON>'s wavy gray locks in line. The artist-writer-film creator called <PERSON> Alexandre </PERSON> the sphinx, which became the hair stylist's logo. When he met the <ORGANIZATION> Carita </ORGANIZATION> sisters the trio decided to set up shop in 1952 on the rue du <ORGANIZATION> Faubourg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Saint-Honore </ORGANIZATION>, not far from the presidential Elysees Palace. Five years later, he branched off and hired a staff of 150, becoming `` <PERSON> Alexandre </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Paris </PERSON>.'' In 1980, he moved to the present salon. With outlets throughout the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and his own salon in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Alexandre </PERSON>'s turnover is about $ 7 million a year _ much of it from his accessory and cosmetics business. In November, he opened a small luxury accessory shop on the rue du Faubourg Saint <PERSON> Honore </PERSON> with <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Lesage </PERSON>, the master embroiderer of haute couture. The whirlwind of fashion shows, royal weddings and openings are all taken in stride, but some events are more memorable _ such as a wedding in 1951 in <LOCATION> Venice </LOCATION> where he made a real splash. `` I'd done Princess <PERSON> Ira </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Furstenburg </PERSON>'s hair for her wedding and was walking the gangplank from the gondola to attend the ceremony.'' he recalled. `` Suddenly, I tripped and fell in the <LOCATION> Venice </LOCATION> canal like a piece of lead.'' <PERSON> Alexandre </PERSON> spends much of his free time with his two children -LRB- neither in the hair business -RRB- and five grandchildren, often spending holidays with them at his villa in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tropez </LOCATION>. But his obsession remains with tresses, and he loves to give advice: `` Long hair is for young girls or women who can afford to have their hair done every day.'' he said. `` Most women should wear something more modern, easier to care for.'' As for older women letting their hair go gray, <PERSON> Alexandre </PERSON> does n't think much of it `` unless the woman has a lovely silvery sheen or a snowy white color, as my grandmother did. Though <PERSON> Alexandre </PERSON> is coiffeur to the stars, he also finds time for ordinary customers `` provided they reserve well in advance.'' A cut and restyling at the salon costs $ 35 dollars, inexpensive by <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> standards. The price for styling by the master himself is higher and is set according to the client. `` I've done the job so well on a few that their own husbands did n't recognize them,'' he said.

 Leftist guerrillas raided an irrigation project, drowned a worker in a tank of gasoline and tried to recruit others to join the insurgency, police reported Friday. They said 30 rebels armed with guns, dynamite and machetes attacked a workers camp at <LOCATION> Ichucruz </LOCATION>, 25 miles south of <LOCATION> Ayachuco </LOCATION> in the Andean highlands, Thursday night. The guerrillas of the <ORGANIZATION> Maoist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shining </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Path </ORGANIZATION> group dynamited vehicles and machinery and ransacked the warehouse, authorities said. When a watchman resisted they tied his hands behind his back and threw him into a tank of gasoline, according to police. About 80 workers were at the camp of the <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cachi </LOCATION> project. Before leaving, the guerrillas urged the workers to join the revolt and threatened those who remained with the project. <PERSON> Godofredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordoba </PERSON>, the engineer in charge of the project, said it is designed to irrigate 37,000 acres of cropland, produce electricity and provide drinking water. He said Thursday's attack was the fifth time Shining Path rebels have raided the camp. In December 1988 they killed four engineers. Police said 200 people were detained in a search for suspects and army units were dispatched to pursue the rebels. The Shining Path began its insurgency in 1980 near <LOCATION> Ayacucho </LOCATION>, 235 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>. The government says more than 17,000 people have been killed in guerrilla-related violence.

 President <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>, nearing the end of his 16 years of military rule, said Friday the Chilean people will soon want the armed forces back in power.

The 73-year-old general and army commander responded: `` Do n't forget that I am a soldier, and since the people asked me to leave, I'm leaving. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> came to power in a bloody 1973 coup that deposed the elected government of Marxist President <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON> <PERSON> Allende </PERSON>. He had to call this month's election after voters in an October 1988 referendum massively rejected a military proposal to extend his rule until 1997. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> will remain army commander after leaving the presidency, as allowed by the 1980 constitution written by his government. He said that as commander, `` I'll be watching what happens in our country, not as a bird of prey, but with a wish of collaborating.''

 An interim, all-party government headed by Premier <PERSON> Xenophon </PERSON> <PERSON> Zolotas </PERSON> won a vote of confidence in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> Saturday and a mandate to stabilize the Greek economy. With all three major parties supporting his administration, <PERSON> Zolotas </PERSON>, an 85-year-old economist, received 292 votes in the 300-member Parliament. Five deputies were absent, one voted against and two abstained in the roll call. <PERSON> Marina </PERSON> <PERSON> Dizi </PERSON>, the lone <ORGANIZATION> Environmentalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> deputy, voted against the government. Two legislators from former Premier <PERSON> Andreas </PERSON> <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Panhellenic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> abstained. The conservative, socialist and communist parties, which control 297 seats, agreed last month to form a joint government until new elections in April. National elections in June and November left no clear winner. <PERSON> Zolotas </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> when debate began Wednesday that his priority will be to tackle government deficits and reduce the government borrowing rate. According to central bank figures, the government will spend $ 1.9 billion more than it receives in taxes this year, up from $ 1.22 billion in 1988 and $ 844 million in 1987. Zolotas, widely credited with <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>'s economic recovery after World War II, blamed `` oversights of the last 20 years'' for the economic situation. He promised `` frugality with economic development.'' The three parties will have to agree on specific measures, such as boosting public utility rates and a proposed one-time tax on personal and company earnings. They put aside their differences on Nov. 22 and asked <PERSON> Zolotas </PERSON>, an independent, to head the government <PERSON> Constantine </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitsotakis </PERSON>'s conservative <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> won the most votes in elections on June 18 and Nov. 5, but fell short of a governing majority <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> urged immediate acceptance of Zolotas' measures, telling Parliament: `` Fiscal developments are serious, but they can be controlled if quick measures are taken and are successful, and they will be successful if they are taken quickly.'' <PERSON> Mitsotakis </PERSON> also called for immediate action. `` If measures are not taken before the holidays it will be too late,'' he said. `` We will have a cash flow shortage by the end of December of ... -LRB- $ 1.3 billion -RRB- which the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Greece </ORGANIZATION> will not be able to make up.'' <PERSON> Hariloas </PERSON> <PERSON> Florakis </PERSON>, head of the communist-led <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Left </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Progress </ORGANIZATION>, asked the government to protect the standard of living and wages of the workers, `` so as to allow us to support the government until the end of its term.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Greece </ORGANIZATION>, the central bank, has said the real income of salaried workers decreased by 10 percent in the last two years because of an annual inflation rate now estimated at 15-16 percent. All three party leaders told <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> an unprecedented spirit of cooperation exists among their organizations. The conservatives and communists joined forces this year to indict <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON>, then premier, on corruption charges. He is to be tried by a special court next year. <PERSON> Mitsotakis </PERSON> said, `` The cleanup can continue, without anyone claiming that petty political interests are being served.''

<HEAD>Public Employees Strike To Get Promised Pay</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. GEORGE'S, Grenada (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 About 7,000 public employees began a strike Friday after Prime Minister <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Blaize </PERSON> said his government could not keep its promise to deliver about $ 9.3 million in back pay. The strike call came near the end of the business day. It was expected to shut down virtually all government offices starting Monday. At a meeting attended by about 1,000 workers, union leaders criticized <PERSON> Blaize </PERSON>'s announcement Thursday night that the government could not pay the retroactive wage increases covering the last three years. <PERSON> Blaize </PERSON> said the government could not pay the money on Friday as promised because it had not received funds `` from expected external sources.'' He did not elaborate but said the money would be paid within three months. The government has had trouble collecting export, property and other taxes, and revenue shortfalls have forced it to borrow heavily from banks. In 1987, imports were nearly three times the value of exports, and the trade deficit was about $ 55 million for this <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> island of 100,000 people. Leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Grenada </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teachers </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Technical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Allied </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> vowed to continue the strike until the money is paid.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Friday it was resuming commercial sale of a key component of nuclear warheads after concluding that amounts listed as missing had n't been stolen after all. The material, tritium, has been sold for 25 years in small amounts for research and for making glow-in-the-dark markings, as for clock faces, exit signs and airport runway markings in remote areas. It is also used to boost the power of nuclear warheads and the power thermonuclear weapons. Twice this year, the Department suspended commercial shipments from the <ORGANIZATION> Oak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ridge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>. The first time followed complaints of customers that they had not received as much as 40 percent of the material they were billed for; the second time, in October, followed the loss of a substantial fraction from a trial shipment designed to test handling procedures. The department's announcement late Friday of the resumption of shipments said: `` Four investigations of the tritium shipping discrepancies have found no evidence to support the possibility of theft or diversion ... Among the causes of the discrepancies were deficiencies in equipment, measurement methods, procedures, records and management and technical oversight'' as well as the unique properties of tritium. Department spokesman <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Keif </PERSON> said he was unable to assign a percentage of the 5 grams listed as missing from commercial shipments to the reasons given, but `` We think it is explainable'' by those reasons. `` We do n't think tritium was stolen,'' <PERSON> Keif </PERSON> said. Tritium is a radioactive form of hydrogen, notoriously difficult to confine in piping and containers. Officials said in October they believed undetected leaks could be one cause of the missing material. The department said it had revised its measurement techniques and saw no need to revise its handling regulations. The nation's tritium production and inventories are secret, but there have been estimates that only about 4 grams is needed for a plutonium-powered warhead.

 Investigators want to know why the `` dead man's switch'' failed on a crane, letting tons of steel pour down on a busy street and killing five people, a state official said Friday. `` The brakes on the crane are its dead man's switch,'' said <LOCATION> Hamilton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fairburn </LOCATION>, deputy chief of the state <ORGANIZATION> Occupational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. `` It takes energy to release brakes.'' The crane's cab made a sudden 180 degree turn Tuesday as the crane's height was being increased from 16 to 20 stories at the construction site of a new high-rise. There have been published reports that the crane's operator, who was among those killed, had a history of alcohol problems and also suggestions that he may have suffered a heart attack. The crane is being studied by experts, but <LOCATION> Fairburn </LOCATION> said going over the wreckage would not be a quick job. The crane, capable of lifting 177 tons, had to be perfectly balanced during the repositioning operation, according to <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Marks </PERSON>, a vice president with <ORGANIZATION> Swinerton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Walberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the general contractor for the project. Despite the necessary balancing, both <LOCATION> Fairburn </LOCATION> and company officials agreed that repositioning a crane is not considered dangerous. `` No one in our firm has ever seen or heard of an incident where a crane collapsed while being raised from one position to another,'' said <PERSON> Ned </PERSON> <PERSON> Gates </PERSON>, the firm's chairman. `` Historically, it's a very safe operation,'' said <LOCATION> Fairburn </LOCATION>. Both government and company investigators are trying to find out why the cab suddenly went out of control. `` The crane's dead-man arrangement is n't like it is on a motorcycle,'' said the investigator. `` There, it's the throttle. You let go, it shuts off. With brakes that are locked in place, you have to take deliberate action.'' He said investigators must find out `` whether it was released by the operator or if there was some malfunction.'' Right now, he said, the probe is focusing on human error. <LOCATION> Fairburn </LOCATION> said he is aware of published reports that crane operator <PERSON> Lonnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Boggess </PERSON> had a history that included alcohol and drug abuse. `` We have expanded our investigation to look into that and have asked the coroner to speed the toxicology report. The alcohol concerns me because of the psychological and physiological problems associated with it,'' he said. Coroner's officials have said blood alcohol test results will be available in about two weeks. There also has been speculation that <PERSON> Boggess </PERSON> may have suffered a heart attack. <PERSON> Boggess </PERSON>' sister, <ORGANIZATION> Genoa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hefke </ORGANIZATION>, said she spoke with a worker who was on the ground and in radio contact with <PERSON> Boggess </PERSON> before the accident. She said the worker told her that the radio suddenly went silent and that <PERSON> Boggess </PERSON>, 45, may have had a heart attack. `` All of a sudden he stopped answering, and then it started rocking back and forth,'' she said. But, said <LOCATION> Fairburn </LOCATION>, a heart attack would n't account for the cab suddenly going out of control. `` Even if he had a heart attack and slumped forward, it is relatively safe because the brakes are locked up. They have guards on them so you ca n't slump over them. Again, it would take deliberate action to release them.''

<TEXT>
 A congressional committee ignored government appeals Friday and approved a bill to have voters decide if suspected drug traffickers should be extradited to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for prosecution. Telling the committee members not to make themselves `` accomplices of drug traffickers,'' Interior Minister <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Lemos </PERSON> <PERSON> Simmonds </PERSON> said approval of the measure would increase drug-related violence. He also suggested drug traffickers were responsible for the crash of a Colombian jetliner Monday. All 107 passengers and crew were killed. If adopted by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and signed by President <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Barco </PERSON>, the bill would provide for a referendum to determine if the extradition of Colombian drug suspects should continue. The Barco administration has sent nine suspected traffickers to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> since it reinstituted extradition on Aug. 18 as part of an anti-drug fight following the assassination of a presidential candidate. Drug traffickers were blamed for the killing. <PERSON> Lemos </PERSON> <PERSON> Simmonds </PERSON> called the proposed bill `` monstrous'' and `` shameful.'' He said a referendum would lead to a national bloodbath as drug traffickers would step up violence to intimidate citizens into rejecting extradition. `` You are inviting Colombians not to a referendum but to the slaughterhouse, because -LRB- the election -RRB- will provoke tremendous violence, deaths and intimidation,'' he said. He also said he feared more drug-linked violence before the presidential elections in May 1990. `` Do n't dirty <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>,'' the minister told the 35-member committee. `` Do n't become the accomplices of drug traffickers.'' The committee voted 24-11 in favor of attaching the referendum bill to legislation to amend the constitution. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION> is scheduled to vote on the legislation Monday. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> then will have to ratify the referendum. <PERSON> Lemos </PERSON> <PERSON> Simmonds </PERSON> said he would ask Barco not to sign the measure. Some members of the committee objected to the minister's suggestion they were pandering to drug traffickers Several said the public had a right to decide if extradition should continue amid a wave of terrorist violence. Authorities have blamed drug traffickers for some 200 bombings that have killed 29 people and injured 238 across <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> in less than four months. <PERSON> Lemos </PERSON> <PERSON> Simmonds </PERSON>, citing examples of violence by drug traffickers, spoke of `` planes that do n't finish their journeys because they are blown up.'' Drug smugglers `` bring down aircraft,'' he added. He was referring to the <ORGANIZATION> Avianca </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727 that exploded minutes after taking off from <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>'s international airport Monday on its way to the southern city of <LOCATION> Cali </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Lemos </PERSON> <PERSON> Simmonds </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Caracol </ORGANIZATION> radio later that he based his statements on claims of responsibility for the jetliner crash by the Extraditables, a terrorist group linked to the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cocaine cartel. A man saying he represented the group told <ORGANIZATION> Caracol </ORGANIZATION> it blew up the plane in retaliation for a police raid on the hideout of <PERSON> Pablo </PERSON> <PERSON> Escobar </PERSON>, a leader of the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cartel, on Nov. 22. <PERSON> Caracol </PERSON> later said it doubted the call's authenticity. Government investigators said they have not determined the cause of the crash but it could have been from an explosive device.

 Nearly 200,000 AIDS cases have been reported worldwide to the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> agency said Friday in a report published to coincide with World AIDS Day. The WHO report covers only people diagnosed as having the disease. The number of notified cases seriously underestimates the true extent of the problem as many cases, especially in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, go unreported. The WHO report also does not include people infected by the HIV virus who have not developed the disease itself. WHO headquarters in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> were draped on Friday with patchwork quilts bearing names and mementos of AIDS victims, including `` <PERSON> Baby </PERSON> <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON>,'' as a poignant reminder of the global tragedy. WHO said in its AIDS Update that 11,000 new victims of the deadly disease, acquired immune deficiency syndrome, were registered by the end of last month, bringing the total number of cases to 198,165. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> reported 3,025 of the new cases, raising its mid-November total to 110,333, about 56 percent of the world total. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has recorded 18,043 new victims so far this year, according to the <ORGANIZATION> WHO </ORGANIZATION> report. Updated figures from <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> brought the total of cases there to 8,025, the second highest behind the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> has reported 7,787 cases and <LOCATION> Uganda </LOCATION>, which has not revised its statistics since April, 7,375 cases. <LOCATION> Bermuda </LOCATION>, with 122 notified cases, has the highest rate of the disease, with 49.1 cases per 100,000 people. Another popular holiday resort, the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION>, follows with 38.0 cases per 100,000. The rate in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is 12.0 per 100,000. WHO said that <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>, the tiny <LOCATION> Comoro </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> republic off <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Marino </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> reported their first case of AIDS <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mann </PERSON>, director of <ORGANIZATION> WHO </ORGANIZATION>'s AIDS program, said that during the 1980s, full blown cases of AIDS are believed to have numbered 600,000 and of those, some 300,000 were thought to have died. He said more than 5 million people became infected with the HIV virus. `` The <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> predicts that by the year 2000, 6 million AIDS cases may have occurred. If HIV spread accelerates, especially in <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, these estimates will be too conservative,'' he told his audience in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. AIDS is a disease in which a virus attacks the body's immune system, leaving victims susceptible to a wide variety of infections and cancers. It is most often transmitted through sexual contact. Other means include sharing of contaminated hypodermic needles or syringes by drug abusers and transfusions of tainted blood or blood products. AIDS can also be passed from mother to child at or before birth. At a ceremony to mark the second World AIDS day at <ORGANIZATION> WHO </ORGANIZATION>'s headquarters, its director-general, Dr. <PERSON> Hiroshi </PERSON> <PERSON> Nakajima </PERSON>, appointed Princess <PERSON> Chulabhorn </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> as <ORGANIZATION> WHO </ORGANIZATION>'s goodwill ambassador for the next two years <PERSON> Chulabhorn </PERSON>, who holds a doctorate in organic chemistry, said she saw as her main task promoting WHO's health objectives among heads of state throughout the world. The daylong event, which focused on young people, included panel discussions, workshops with local schoolchildren and release of two new films on AIDS. Brightly colored quilts hung on the walls of the WHO building. `` Baby <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON>'' was embroidered among pictures of teddy bears on one large piece of patchwork. A huge patchwork map of <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> hung in silent tribute to the unknown number of victims on the continent.

 A minister whose controversial children's home spurred a law governing such operations is being sued by the state for not complying with the statute The Rev. <PERSON> Herman </PERSON> <PERSON> Fountain </PERSON> and his <ORGANIZATION> Bethel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Children </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> are named in the lawsuit as failing to register the church-operated boarding home with the state. Fountain has contended he answers only to God and does n't have to abide by state law. The minister is free on $ 40,000 bond pending appeal of a year's prison sentence stemming from a raid in 1988 that led to 72 children being taken into custody following allegations of abuse at the home. The incident spurred the Legislature this year to pass a law regulating all 24-hour child-care services, including those with a religious affiliation. Fountain, a 40-year-old independent Baptist minister, was found guilty of assault on a police officer, but was never charged with any mistreatment or abuse of the children. Reached by telephone, the minister declined to comment on the lawsuit. Fountain is accused of failing to turn over information to the state concerning his boarding home for primarily wayward youths, located on a 28-acre complex on the outskirts of <LOCATION> Lucedale </LOCATION>. The complaint also alleges that Fountain refused an inspection by the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marshal </ORGANIZATION>'s Office.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> on Friday decried a county sheriff's policy that forces homosexual jail inmates to wear pink bracelets. `` It reflects homophobia,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> attorney in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>. `` Labeling people's clothing based on a sexual preference seems an extreme response to a situation that does n't warrant it. For at least 15 years, homosexual inmates at the <LOCATION> Polk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jail </LOCATION> have been kept separate from other inmates and labeled with pink wrist bands. The sheriff says it's for their own safety. `` All hell would break loose'' in the prison if homosexuals were allowed to mix with the general population, said Sheriff <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Crow </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> `` If this system was n't needed for their own protection, I'd change it in a minute.'' <PERSON> Crow </PERSON> said homosexual inmates are often the targets of ridicule and beatings, so jailers ask all inmates their sexual preference when they enter the facility. If the inmate says he is homosexual, `` he is given a wrist band and kept separate from the general population,'' said sheriff's spokeswoman <PERSON> Lynne </PERSON> <PERSON> Breidenbach </PERSON> `` If we find out things later and have probable cause that he's a homosexual, then we put the wrist band on.'' Ms. <PERSON> Breidenbach </PERSON> said different colored bands are used to distinguish inmates for other reasons, such as green for escape-risk inmates. She said there was no special reason pink was chosen to distinguish homosexuals. `` It's really an off-red,'' she said. `` That's just the color that was available.'' The county jail has 1,199 inmates, of which 25 to 35 are wearing bracelets identifying them as homosexuals, <PERSON> Breidenbach </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> attorney <PERSON> Green </PERSON> said he is studying possible civil action to have the practice stopped as unconstitutional. He cited a case in <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> two years ago in which a federal court ruled against segregation of homosexual inmates. <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> <PERSON> Warren </PERSON>, the sheriff's legal counsel, said Thursday the practice of labeling inmates is legal and `` in the best interest of the safety of all the inmates.'' The sheriff, while not acknowledging complaints from inmates or the <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION>, said he has been looking into switching the colored bands to bands that have bar codes similar to those used in supermarkets. Waving a scanner over the bracelets would tell staff members whether inmates have medical problems or are wanted in another county, according to <LOCATION> Crow </LOCATION>, who said no immediate plans have been made to switch to the system. While bands with bar codes would be an improvement, they're not a solution, <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> officials said. <PERSON> Robyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Blumner </PERSON>, executive director for <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION>, described the bar codes as `` more palatable than pink tags.'' But she maintained that sexual orientation should n't have anything to do with inmate classifications. `` Predator inmates should be separated from victim inmates, but sexual preference should have nothing to do with it,'' she said. Gays who seek protection from others should be granted it, <PERSON> Blumner </PERSON> said, but only at their choice _ not the sheriff's. <PERSON> Blumner </PERSON> said six lesbian inmates have written to her with complaints that being `` pink tagged'' has limited their privileges and brought harsh treatment from corrections officers. <PERSON> Crow </PERSON> denies the charges.

 Investigators hope to make a map of two cemeteries where it is believed thousands of bodies might have been buried in already occupied graves, a state official said Friday. Attorney General <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Cowan </PERSON>'s consumer protection division launched an investigation of the cemeteries in May after a tip from a grave-digger that old burial lots were being re-used. Investigators have since unearthed old headstones at the Eastern Cemetery, near downtown, and at <LOCATION> Greenwood </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cemetery </LOCATION>, on the city's west side, and have speculated that many old graves were not marked properly, if at all The cemeteries are thought to contain about 81,000 bodies.

The burial grounds are owned by <ORGANIZATION> Louisville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crematory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cemeteries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, founded in 1854. The corporation and three of its officers were charged with 60 criminal counts, including theft, corpse abuse and grave desecration.

 A Soviet official on Friday denied that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> ambassador here ordered the Nicaraguan and <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> governments at a secret meeting in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> to stop shipping weapons to leftist rebels in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. The French newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Le </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monde </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday quoted an unidentified leader of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s leftist <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> government as its source. According to <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Monde </PERSON>, the man said Soviet Ambassador <PERSON> Valeri </PERSON> <PERSON> Nikolaenko </PERSON> gave the order after Salvadoran authorities reported finding two light planes bound from <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> with arms for Salvadoran rebels. `` We have spoken with our ambassador ... and he utterly denies having made statements in this sense,'' said <PERSON> Igor </PERSON> <PERSON> Rybalkin </PERSON>, of the international department of the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s policy-making <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> `` Besides, because of the very principle of our relations with countries like <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, like <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, this is excluded.'' President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> has not denied the Salvadoran accusation. <PERSON> Rybalkin </PERSON> said his government was concerned about the situation in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, and the region's conflicts will probably be discussed at the weekend summit between presidents <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. He said that althouth the agenda was open for the <LOCATION> Gorbachev-Bush </LOCATION> summit, `` it's very possible, and I'm even sure, that the <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> conflict is going to figure'' in their discussions. <PERSON> Rybalkin </PERSON> is on a goodwill tour of the region.

 Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> assured visiting <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> senators on the eve of a superpower summit that <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> will not forsake <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> to reunite with <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, one of the senators said Friday. `` He strongly affirmed under no circumstances would a reunified <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> be neutral,'' Sen. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lugar </PERSON>, head of the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> delegation, said of the Friday meeting with <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>. Asked whether he thought the West Germans were committed to staying in the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> military alliance of Western nations, the <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> Republican said: `` Without any reservations.'' There is growing discussion in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> about German reunification as a result of sweeping social and political reforms underway in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. There has been speculation that <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> might someday be tempted to agree to neutrality if the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> stipulates it as the price for reunification. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> on Tuesday unveiled a 10-point proposal with German reunification as its ultimate goal. But the Soviets, who suffered millions of deaths fighting a unified <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> in World War II, have said the idea of German reunification is `` dangerous and unrealistic.'' President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> are to begin a shipboard summit off <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> on Saturday. The dramatic events in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and whirlwind reforms elsewhere in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc are likely to be a main topic of their talks. <PERSON> Lugar </PERSON> came to <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> with eight other members of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s arms control observer group He said the purpose of the trip was to `` visit with the Germans on their judgments about all of these procedures that are going on.'' <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walters </PERSON> joined the senators for their 75-minute closed-door talks with <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>. The senators also met with Foreign Minister <PERSON> Hans-Dietrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> and Defense Minister <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Stoltenberg </PERSON> during the day. <PERSON> Lugar </PERSON> said <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> told the Americans that reunification would be a `` procedure that depends on many events in <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'' and that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> have a role to play. <PERSON> Lugar </PERSON> said of <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s proposals, `` There is much to work with there with regard to the future of <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and the future of the -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- alliance.''

<HEAD>Jurors May Have Reached Decision on Five More Counts, Judge Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Jurors who turned in one verdict in the McMartin preschool molestation case may be withholding five others for fear of disrupting work on dozens of remaining counts, the judge said Friday. The panelists may be trying to avoid explaining their verdicts to friends and work colleagues while on a scheduled two-week vacation that begins Dec. 16, Superior Court Judge <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Pounders </PERSON> said. On Tuesday, jurors handed in one sealed verdict, but they may have reached a decision on five more of the 65 counts against <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Buckey </PERSON> and his mother, <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> McMartin </PERSON> <PERSON> Buckey </PERSON>, <PERSON> Pounders </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Buckey </PERSON>, 31, and his mother, 63, are charged with molestation and conspiracy in connection with the alleged sexual molestation of 11 students at their now-defunct, family-owned school in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>. The 2 -LCB- - year-old proceeding, the nation's longest criminal trial, has cost <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> more than $ 15 million Meanwhile, the judge said he may not read the sealed verdict by Dec. 15 as he had previously considered. The judge said he is considering sequestering the jury and waiting until all the verdicts are in before reading them. Earlier, he had indicated he had tentative plans to read the verdicts piecemeal. <PERSON> Pounders </PERSON> previously had ordered the jurors to return verdicts as they were reached, calling it `` an insane process'' but a way of avoiding a potential mistrial if one of the 12 panelists is unable to continue. No alternates are available, and the sealed verdicts become legal only when the jurors affirm their decisions in court. `` The worst possible situation is to have verdicts that are not legally effective and then lose jurors,'' <PERSON> Pounders </PERSON> said Friday. However, the judge said last month he could find no case law to support his plan to accept sealed verdicts one at a time, and <PERSON> Buckey </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, had objected to the procedure. Attorneys were to meet with the judge on Monday to discuss when the verdicts should be read.

 The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> on Friday ended the search for a lobster boat and its five-member crew after 11 days of rescue efforts spanning thousands of miles of the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION>. `` It's a very difficult conclusion to reach, but we've come to the point where our chances of success are about nil,'' Rear Admiral <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Rybacki </PERSON> said in a statement. <PERSON> Rybacki </PERSON> commands the <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, the search operation headquarters where the search was launched after the 72-foot <PERSON> Heidi </PERSON> <PERSON> Marie </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Stonington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, was reported missing last week.

The program is scheduled to air Dec. 7. <PERSON> Darden </PERSON>, who has not seen a UFO himself, told <PERSON> Rivers </PERSON> he has thought about abandoning the issue since the council overwhelmingly defeated his bill earlier this year to build a landing pad. `` But something keeps pushing me to do it and folks keep calling me about sitings,'' <PERSON> Darden </PERSON> said.

 Evidence of the AIDS epidemic is everywhere in this city, from the political coalitions formed to battle the lethal illness to the millions being spent to care for its victims. Most residents know of someone who has AIDS. The health care system is saturated, local officials are pleading for federal funds and the gay community has rallied as never before. <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> has the nation's highest per-capita incidence of AIDS. Authorities expect that by the end of the year more than 24,000 residents will have been infected with the virus. Of 7,416 people reported with full-blown AIDS, 4,827 have died. Eight years after AIDS began to cut its deadly swath across <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, changes are apparent. Instead of organizing to get government `` off our backs and out of our bedrooms,'' gay activists have launched a powerful movement to make government work for them. `` We realized that government did have a role to play in our lives,'' said <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Braithwaite </PERSON>, president of the <PERSON> Alice </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Toklas </PERSON> <PERSON> Lesbian </PERSON> and Gay Democratic Club. As gay men and lesbians work together on AIDS, they are forging an alliance some believe will exert unprecedented influence. `` It has made us politically stronger, wiser and better organized than we have ever been,'' said <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, an aide to Board of Supervisors President <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Britt </PERSON> and chairwoman of the Gay and Lesbian Caucus of the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Democratic Party. The city has become an international model for low-cost, patient-oriented AIDS care that relies on an enormous base of volunteers, but the cost of the epidemic is daunting. Total AIDS spending this year is estimated at $ 115 million, according to mayoral aide <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ehrlich </PERSON>. Most of the $ 80 million from the private sector will come from private health insurers, the city will add $ 7.6 million, and state and federal government will provide the rest, she said. And officials expect an additional $ 30 million will be needed when the city formally endorses early care programs for people without symptoms. The city's AIDS Office has 75 employees and a budget this year of $ 25 million, including state and federal funds, to coordinate more than 200 different AIDS organizations and service providers. When it was established in 1983, the office had one director, a secretary and $ 150,000. At <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, AIDS care will cost between $ 15 million and $ 20 million this year, executive director <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Sowa </PERSON> said. The 20 beds designated for AIDS patients are always full and 20 overflow patients are hospitalized in different wards, he said. A crisis looms in the city's inability to provide sufficient post-hospital care at skilled nursing facilities and board-and-care homes, he said. Many speak of the `` talent drain'' as the city loses so many people in their prime. The impact can be devastating. `` Who would've thought I'd be reading the obits at 40? Every day,'' said <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, former lover and business partner of <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> Milk </PERSON>, the city's first openly gay supervisor, who was slain in 1978 along with Mayor <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Moscone </PERSON>. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said he ca n't bear to replace his outdated address book `` and leave out all the names that would n't move into the new one.'' AIDS also has politicized a new generation of activists who scrutinize anything having to do with the disease. Organizations like Stop AIDS Now Or Else have staged controversial protests like blockading the Golden Gate Bridge and disrupting the glittery opening night of the opera season to call attention to demands for faster action on drug testing and increased financing for AIDS care and research. `` I think AIDS is one of the new exciting things to be radical about,'' said <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Rofes </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Shanti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Project </ORGANIZATION>, a volunteer-based AIDS agency that serves 1,200 a month. In the gay community, AIDS prevention and education remain a top priority. Some credit AIDS with triggering a trend toward long-term, committed relationships between gay men, while others say the health crisis simply speeded up a process that began before AIDS. `` I believe that without AIDS, the picture would look very similar in terms of more coupling and more -LRB- adopted -RRB- children,'' said <PERSON> Rofes </PERSON>. Public health experts worry that their greatest challenge in the gay community now is keeping the `` safe sex'' message alive. Researchers have noted a slight increase in the number of gay men who are engaging in unsafe sex again, despite the high risk. About half of the gay men in the city are believed to be infected with HIV. Having saturated their own community with prevention information, gays are forming alliances with other high-risk groups, including intravenous drug users. Fighting AIDS also has united gay men and lesbians. Although some doubt the durability of the alliance, <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> points to <PERSON> Britt </PERSON>'s domestic partnership legislation as a byproduct of the AIDS epidemic and a signal of future struggles. The proposal, which was narrowly defeated by city voters in November, would have recognized unions between unmarried live-in lovers who register with the city, and would have extended visitation and bereavement-leave rights to city workers. The proposal had strong backing from gays in the age of AIDS who had been denied hospital access to their dying lovers or were turned down when requesting time off to attend funerals, <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> said. Large corporations have developed AIDS education programs and provide referrals for employees seeking counseling or other services. But many small businesses can not get affordable health coverage, according to <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Hauge </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Small </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, who said one company with 200 workers faced across-the-board rate increases of 125 percent after two employees came down with AIDS. `` We've demonstrated that the health care system in this country is very fragile and a lot of people are slipping through it,'' said <PERSON> Braithwaite </PERSON> of the <PERSON> Toklas </PERSON> club. Signs of the AIDS epidemic are everywhere _ even in the chirp of personal electronic timers frequently heard in restaurants and movie theaters in predominantly gay neighborhoods. They're reminding AIDS patients to take the anti-viral drug AZT

<HEAD>Muni Bonds in Moscow? Consultant Trying To Point the Way</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BART ZIEGLER</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
 Is <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> ready for muni bonds? An American financial consultant is trying to find that out. <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sachs </PERSON> has signed an agreement with Soviet officials to help develop the concept of public bond financing in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Sachs </PERSON> says his plan is aimed at giving Soviet residents a place to put their huge savings of rubles and at the same time aid the rebuilding of the nation's economy. Any bond program would have to overcome intense skepticism on the part of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> people, but <PERSON> Sachs </PERSON> believes it is worth a try. `` The whole essence of the program is to put the ruble to work,'' he said in an interview last week. <PERSON> Sachs </PERSON>, 37, runs a consulting firm in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and used to be chief of staff for Rep. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Downey </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Democrat. Last summer he directed government affairs for the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> Peace Festival, a rock concert. He is not to be confused with the <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> professor of the same name who advises Latin American debtor nations and <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s Solidarity movement. The president of <ORGANIZATION> Jeffrey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> A. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sachs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said he developed his contacts with Soviet officials while helping set up the Make a <ORGANIZATION> Difference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> concert, whose proceeds went to programs fighting drug and alcohol abuse. `` I realized that in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, public finance is a very logical place to begin developing an investment banking system _ everything is government there,'' he said. He said the Soviets were taken with the idea, including ones from the influential Institute of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S.A. </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. In a letter to <ORGANIZATION> Sachs </ORGANIZATION> in September, <PERSON> Georgy </PERSON> <PERSON> Arbatov </PERSON>, the institute's director and a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, said the biggest concern was the non-convertibility of the ruble into hard Western currencies. To tailor public finance bonds to Soviet investors _ who may not be attracted by the prospect of earning more rubles, since there is little to buy with them _ <ORGANIZATION> Sachs </ORGANIZATION> proposes that the bonds pay interest in the form of foreign currency certificates. These certificates could be spent in the country's hard-currency shops. <PERSON> Sachs </PERSON> also suggested to the Soviets that they create a savings bond program, which would pay interest in rubles rather than hard currencies. Such an issue would need to address concerns about inflation and compensate for any devaluations in the ruble, <ORGANIZATION> Sachs </ORGANIZATION> said, in order to attract Soviet investors. These bonds would leverage the vast amounts of rubles Soviet citizens have salted away, and be a good use of the country's scarce hard currency, <PERSON> Sachs </PERSON> said Under the `` protocol of intentions'' <ORGANIZATION> Sachs </ORGANIZATION> signed last month <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> officials, including <PERSON> Arbatov </PERSON>, <PERSON> Sachs </PERSON> agreed to assemble a group of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic and investment advisers to help devise a demonstration project using a bond issue. Possibilities under consideration include housing, a manufacturing plant and a hospital. <PERSON> Sachs </PERSON> said he has had preliminary discussions with several Wall Street firms, which he declined to identify. He said the protocol is the first step in a process that is expected to lead to a joint-venture agreement with the Soviets. The protocol, which also was signed by the deputy chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reform </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministers </ORGANIZATION>, states that `` the development of a system of public finance in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is a critical component of economic reform.'' One expert on the Soviet economy was skeptical of <PERSON> Sachs </PERSON>'s proposals `` Bonds have a bad reputation among the Soviet people,'' said <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brada </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> professor. <PERSON> Brada </PERSON> said Soviets were soured on bonds by a Stalin-era bond program used to help finance the government. `` Everyone had to buy these bonds. They hated it,'' he said in a telephone interview. The bonds were repudiated by <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON>, who said the government would not make payments on them. <PERSON> Brada </PERSON> said Soviets also would question any plan to index a bond's return to inflation or currency changes. `` People see that real inflation is much higher than what the state's index shows,'' he said. `` No one is going to believe that the indexing is going to be done honestly.'' <PERSON> Brada </PERSON> believes a better way to improve the Soviet economy would be to devalue the ruble sharply and make it convertible into Western currencies.

 Big success has come in small packages for <ORGANIZATION> Lewis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Galoob </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Toys </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. Its tiny vehicles have been zooming off store shelves Micro Machines have ridden onto Toy and Hobby World magazine's monthly lineup of fast sellers all year, consistently finishing in the top 10 places and frequently in the first, second or third slots. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Galoob </PERSON> says the company is headed toward being a major player in the toy business in the 1990s. Analysts are impressed with its progress so far. <PERSON> Galoob </PERSON> provided an early look at next year's toys Friday in a tour of the company's <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> showroom. `` Miniature has worked for <PERSON> Galoob </PERSON> and we believe that it can work again,'' the president and chief executive officer said in an interview. The company is named for his father, who founded it more than three decades ago and died in 1971. Many of the new toys <PERSON> Galoob </PERSON> will roll out next year continue the small-size theme that has helped the company stage a strong comeback from a 1987 industrywide slump. <PERSON> Galoob </PERSON> lost almost $ 25 million that year but returned to profitability in 1988 by earning more than $ 6 million. New models of the thimble-sized <ORGANIZATION> Micro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> will be added to the hundreds already available. Some will have a magnifying lens in place of a sun roof so children can peer into the teeny interior. New playsets are being added to the car-wash and service station already on the market. Ultra-small vehicles inside regular-sized <ORGANIZATION> Micro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> will be brought out in 1990. A motorized train and track set also will be unveiled. The existing collection, which appeals to children's acquisitive instincts, includes commonplace and fancy cars from diminutive Rolls Royces to souped-up Dodge Vans. The line also has ambulances, fire engines, trucks, boats, tanks, planes and trains. One 1990 addition to <PERSON> Galoob </PERSON>'s miniatures for girls is Secret Places, a series of dolls in rooms with furniture and appliances that open to reveal even smaller but virtually identical versions. New offspring of the successful Bouncin' Baby miniature doll line will make their debut. <PERSON> Galoob </PERSON> started thinking small in 1987 when consumers soured on high-priced, high-tech toys. Keeping prices down _ a package of five <ORGANIZATION> Micro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> can be bought for under $ 10 _ proved wise over the past two years when so much money was being spent on home video games. Children and their parents have n't had much left over for other toys after buying <ORGANIZATION> Nintendo </ORGANIZATION> games. `` We were able to live and compete very well with the video game onslaught,'' <PERSON> Galoob </PERSON> boasts. Retail analysts say <PERSON> Galoob </PERSON> is one of the only companies that has kept coming up with creative products despite the competitive challenge of video games. While industry leaders like <ORGANIZATION> Hasbro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Mattel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> turned to classics like G.I. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> and <PERSON> Barbie </PERSON>, <PERSON> Galoob </PERSON> has established a new category of miniature collectibles. In the process, <ORGANIZATION> Micro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> have whizzed past <ORGANIZATION> Mattel </ORGANIZATION>'s Hot Wheels and <ORGANIZATION> Universal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Matchbox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>'s matchbox cars to become the most popular collectible vehicle line in the world. The company expects to have $ 200 million in sales this year, up from $ 140 million in 1988. It has managed to do it with less money to spend on research and development than its larger competitors, such as No. 1 <ORGANIZATION> Hasbro </ORGANIZATION>, which analysts estimate will have $ 1.5 billion in 1989 sales `` It really is a challenge for us to compete with those gentlemen that have bigger dollars at their disposal,'' <PERSON> Galoob </PERSON> said. After previewing next year's toys, analyst <ORGANIZATION> Paul </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valentine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Poor </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said he upgraded his investment opinion on <PERSON> Galoob </PERSON> to a strong buy from neutral. `` I was very impressed with what they had,'' <PERSON> Valentine </PERSON> said. Besides the miniature items, one of <PERSON> Galoob </PERSON>'s 1990 toys is a stuffed animal with battery-powered, illuminated eyes that small children can take to bed as a night light. A talking doll that moves her lips also is waiting in the wings and will sell for about $ 60. `` We do n't mind getting into higher priced, high-tech toys _ we just do n't want to be dependent on them,'' <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Galoob </PERSON> said. How well <PERSON> Galoob </PERSON> does outside the miniature category could determine whether it can make the transition to a big-time toy company. Analyst <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirchberger </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> PaineWebber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said the verdict is still out on whether <PERSON> Galoob </PERSON> has done enough to diversify and protect itself if <ORGANIZATION> Micro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> fall out of favor. Micro Machines will account for more than half of <PERSON> Galoob </PERSON>'s 1989 business, which was the case in 1988 as well. It will be tougher for <PERSON> Galoob </PERSON> to impress Wall Street next year because the company will face a much higher tax rate, eroding after-tax earnings. `` For earnings to be up in 1990, sales will have to be up quite a bit,'' <PERSON> Kirchberger </PERSON> said. Through three quarters of this year, <PERSON> Galoob </PERSON> has earned about $ 14 million, up more than three-fold from a year earlier, while sales totaled about $ 170 million, up 80 percent. Eighty-five percent of <PERSON> Galoob </PERSON>'s manufacturing is done in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. The company is trying to spread out to other Asian nations and was planning to rely more on <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION> even before the June uprising in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Galoob </PERSON> said. Growth in the next decade will partly come through acquisitions and <PERSON> Galoob </PERSON> says the company, which is based in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, has put aside $ 40 million for the purpose. In the meantime, he expressed confidence about business prospects despite weakness in the economy. `` There are always children so the toy industry is sort of recession-proof.''

<HEAD>Judge Denies U-Haul Motion in Suit Against Ryder</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A judge on Friday denied Phoenix-based <ORGANIZATION> U-Haul </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s request to order 2,500 of a competitor's biggest trucks off the road U-Haul had asked Judge <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenblatt </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> for a preliminary injunction against <ORGANIZATION> Ryder </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, claiming that Miami-based Ryder had equipped a fleet of 24-foot rental trucks with a loading device similar to one U-Haul patented Jan. 30, 1973. The patent expires Jan. 30, 1990. The patented device, U-Haul maintained, gives its trucks a competitive advantage of having lower rear decks, making them easier for consumers to load and unload. Ryder told the judge it would suffer an $ 8 million loss in the fourth quarter if it had to remove its trucks from the marketplace. The trucks were introduced in early 1989. Both sides claimed victory Friday. `` It was very favorable to the U-Haul patent,'' said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, an attorney for U-Haul. <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> said <PERSON> Rosenblatt </PERSON> refused to issue the injunction largely because the `` damage to Ryder, by having all 2,500 of its infringing trucks parked, outweighed U-Haul's need for such a short injunction.'' `` We are gratified that the court has so far supported Ryder's position,'' <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Ryder </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Truck </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rental </ORGANIZATION>, said in a statement Ryder contends it did not infringe on U-Haul's patent. The 2,500 trucks, which each cost about $ 30,000, represent about 8 percent of Ryder's fleet of consumer rental vehicles, Ryder said. U-Haul on Aug. 23 filed a patent-infringement suit against Ryder, and on Sept. 15 filed for the preliminary injunction asking that the trucks be taken off the road. A trial has yet to be scheduled in the case, but is expected to go before <PERSON> Rosenblatt </PERSON> during the first half of 1990.

<HEAD>Securities Industry Group Proposals Ending Barrier With Banks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BOCA RATON, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Wall Street leaders have declared an end to their lengthy battle to keep banks out of the stocks and bonds business, proposing to repeal the law that has governed the nation's basic banking structure since the Depression. Directors of the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, at the trade group's annual convention here, on Friday endorsed a proposal for new legislation to let subsidiaries of banks `` engage in a broad range of securities and securities-related activities.'' At the same time, the <ORGANIZATION> SIA </ORGANIZATION> said its plan would let brokers engage in consumer banking businesses and join banks in having access to the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>'s banking system, including the right to borrow from the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> in emergencies. The move appears to herald one of the biggest breaks yet in the gradually crumbling wall separating banking and brokerage activities, erected by the Glass-Steagall Act of 1933 amid the financial crisis that followed the stock market crash four years earlier. The barrier has been weakened chink by chink in recent years, with the move toward financial deregulation and court decisions permitting banks to make increasing inroads into what had formerly been the brokers' turf. For example, many banks now participate in new offerings of some kinds of securities, offer discount stock brokerage and sell shares in mutual funds. Brokers, for their part, have also successfully launched forays into businesses once considered the domain of the banks. In 1977, for example, they began to offer `` central assets accounts'' that are technically not bank deposits, but come with such features as check-writing, credit cards and lines of credit. The banking industry itself has used such brokerage services as an argument for dismantling Glass-Steagall and allowing them greater authority to enter the securities, insurance and real estate businesses. Nevertheless, brokers have until now consistently sought to hold the Glass-Steagall line, arguing that banks would enjoy several unfair advantages in any arena of unfettered competition. They also say banks, with their federal deposit insurance and links to the Federal Reserve System, should not be allowed to expose themselves to risky ventures involving such things as the sale of stocks. <ORGANIZATION> SIA </ORGANIZATION> officials said that banking groups played no part in formulating their plan, which was made after a lengthy board meeting late Friday. <PERSON> Hardwick </PERSON> <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>, of <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION>, the outgoing chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> SIA </ORGANIZATION>, said the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, which regulates Wall Street, had been consulted and indicated that it `` applauded the initiative.'' The <ORGANIZATION> SIA </ORGANIZATION> said it would be holding talks with the next few weeks with the <ORGANIZATION> Bush </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and regulators to work out details of what could amount to one of the most sweeping changes in basic financial legislation in 56 years. One widely discussed possible result of any Glass-Steagall reform has been mergers between the biggest banks and brokerage firms. <ORGANIZATION> SIA </ORGANIZATION> did not address such specifics. However, most observers point out that after any merger banking and brokerage activities still would have to be conducted by separate subsidiaries of the same company because brokers are regulated by the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> while banking is regulated by a different set of agencies, including the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>, Comptroller of the Currency and <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> `` We think that anything that leads to vastly increased financial concentration is not in the broader interests of our financial system,'' said <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Guenther </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, which represents thousands of community banks. Asked about the late-afternoon development, <ORGANIZATION> Citicorp </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Maloney </PERSON> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> said executives at the nation's largest banking company would want to study the full resolution. But he added, `` It's been a bad month for walls.'' Outside observers see a variety of possible motives for the <ORGANIZATION> SIA </ORGANIZATION>'s change of strategy. Some believe that influential members of the securities business felt it was useless and costly to keep fighting pitched battles, a good many of which were being lost. Also, the proposal comes at a time when brokers are confronted with a barrage of other problems, including high overhead and shrinking profits from many of their traditional activities. When one prominent Wall Street figure, Chairman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Gutfreund </PERSON> of the investment banking firm <ORGANIZATION> Salomon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, spoke to the convention on Thursday, he declared: `` It is time for all the institutions in the financial services industry to find some common ground.'' A major mission facing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> financial institutions, he said, is to `` work to design the post-Glass-Steagall world.''
