 <PERSON> Bond </PERSON> was revoked Tuesday for a couple facing sentencing for income tax evasion after an <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> agent testified they stashed $ 1 million in valuables in hiding places such as trucks and a chicken coop. <PERSON> Randall </PERSON> and <PERSON> Trula </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION> are accused of plundering <ORGANIZATION> Campbell </ORGANIZATION> 66, once a nationwide trucking firm run by <PERSON> Trula </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>'s father. <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, the company's former secretary-treasurer, pleaded guilty Aug. 2 to concealing income by submitting false income tax returns from 1981-85. He also pleaded guilty to filing false income reports to the <ORGANIZATION> Interstate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Campbell </ORGANIZATION> 66. Mrs. <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> was found guilty in August of tax evasion and conspiring to defraud the federal government. The Walkers were jailed Friday after authorities discovered caches of jewelry, furniture and cash at several sites in <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>. `` By the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> recovering part of this treasure trove, the risk that the Walkers might flee is enhanced, not lessened,'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Whipple </PERSON> said in ordering them held without bond. `` It is obvious that they intended to keep these assets hidden until they paid whatever fines might be assessed, and then still have a mother lode to start over with.'' <PERSON> Whipple </PERSON> said he hoped to sentence the couple this week. <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> agent <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> testified Tuesday that two confidential sources led agents to the stashed assets, some of which had been buried in a chicken coop and a machine shed. Agents also found semi-truck loads of furniture, including a 5-foot-tall chandelier and several pieces of antique furniture. <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> said as many as four truckloads may have been filled with the Walkers' assets in the past two years. Other assets uncovered included about $ 315,000 in cash, nearly 600 precious stones and 30 pounds of gold flatware. <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> testified that agents were still trying to determine the whereabouts of furs and `` almost priceless'' jeweled Faberge Easter eggs. Once, about $ 150,000 of the buried money became wet and one of the confidential sources dried it in a clothes dryer, <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> said. `` The confidential source said that at one point, with both Walkers present, he put jewelry in a pipe,'' <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> said. `` The jewelry was found in a machine shop near the source's home, buried under a floor.'' <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> also said agents found jewelry and cash encased in cement in a tool shed and about $ 150,000 to $ 160,000 in a chicken coop. Another $ 180,000 was found buried in two glass jars. He said a preliminary assessment showed that the items found were valued at a little over $ 1 million. The Walkers owe the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> at least that much, he said. <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Kabonic </PERSON>, a probation officer in <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>, testified that the Walkers submitted 1988 financial statements to him in August saying they had $ 6,250 cash on hand and total personal property of about $ 5,000.

 Three anti-nuclear protesters were arrested for trying to cling to the hull of a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> frigate, and activists charged Tuesday that crew members turned high-powered water hoses on the demonstrators. The protesters, who were in rubber dinghies,, were charged with disorderly conduct after the incident Monday. They tried to hang onto the hull of the <ORGANIZATION> USS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brewton </ORGANIZATION>, which was moored near <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION> off the southern coast of <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>. Cmdr. <PERSON> Kraig </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, the <PERSON> Brewton </PERSON>'s commander, said hoses were turned on the protesters because they planned to deface the vessel with spray paint. Earlier, the three attached a banner to the ship. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said the action may have been `` heavy-handed'' but that every precaution was taken to prevent injury. <PERSON> Jo </PERSON> <PERSON> Vallentine </PERSON>, a member of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> and an activist in the Party for Nuclear Disarmament, demanded an apology, saying one protester was treated at a hospital for an eye injury and facial bruises. ` I believe it is the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> that should be charged with disorderly conduct,'' she told reporters after a meeting with <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>.

 Teachers carried picket signs in more than 20 public school districts in four states Tuesday. Many held out for raises, and the biggest pay demand, 42 percent over three years, drew the ire of a mayor as `` irresponsible.'' `` The teachers decided it's time to take a stand and that stand actually is a walk and that's what we'll be doing tomorrow morning: walking a picket line,'' said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Grady </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teachers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lowell </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, after a unanimous strike vote there Tuesday. The first day of school was canceled Wednesday for the city's 13,100 pupils. Nationally, walkouts affected more than 100,000 pupils in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>. A strike in its third week in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> was settled Tuesday night. More than 1,400 professors and academic staff members at <ORGANIZATION> Wayne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> also went on strike Tuesday over union work rules and salary. University president <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Adamany </PERSON> predicted classes for the roughly 30,000 students would continue with other full-time and part-time instructors, but professors said they expected few classes to be held. An additional 950 clerical workers and secretaries represented by the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> have been on strike at <ORGANIZATION> Wayne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> since Aug. 25. In <LOCATION> Pontiac </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, bargainers representing 991 teachers met with school officials through the weekend with no success. Major issues were class size and salary, with teachers asking for a 10 percent raise and being offered 2 percent, <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Colleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Hudgens </PERSON> said. Superintendent <PERSON> LaBarbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Gragg </PERSON> said Monday night that talks would be scheduled later in the week. Meanwhile, classes that opened Sept. 1 were canceled Tuesday for <LOCATION> Pontiac </LOCATION>'s 17,284 students as teachers picketed, Deputy Superintendent <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> <PERSON> Love </PERSON> said. In State College, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, 415 teachers staged the first strike in the district's history, said union spokesman <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Apaliski </PERSON>. About 5,900 students missed the scheduled opening day of school Tuesday. `` We are not at all close,'' district spokeswoman <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Best </PERSON> said. `` It's very discouraging.'' The school board offered a 33 percent raise over three years, Ms. <PERSON> Best </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Area </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> has not made public its pay demand. In <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, teachers in nearly 40 school districts are going to work this week without a contract. The only strike votes taken, however, were in <LOCATION> Lowell </LOCATION> and Peabody. Teacher strikes are illegal in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. Officials canceled the first day of school for 13,100 pupils Wednesday in <LOCATION> Lowell </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, after the district's 970 teachers voted unanimously to strike for more pay and to preserve longevity bonuses. In Peabody, the city's 408 teachers rejected a 17 percent wage increase over three years and held out for 42 percent over the same time span. `` To sit at the table locked in at 42 percent is totally irresponsible,'' said Peabody Mayor <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Torigian </PERSON>. School Superintendent <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Buckley </PERSON> said administrators were trying to bring in enough substitutes to keep classes going. <PERSON> Bert </PERSON> <PERSON> Latessa </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teachers </ORGANIZATION> defended the union's position. The 42 percent wage request, <PERSON> Latessa </PERSON> said, is smaller than it appears because the teachers maintain that they have been performing extra duties such as elementary preparation and handling oversized classes without extra pay. Here was the picture by state-by-state: <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>: Strikes in 10 districts idled nearly 45,000 students and more than 2,000 teachers, the <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said. <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>: Strikes by about 2,200 teachers in nine districts affected about 36,000 students, according to <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Badner </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Pennsylvania </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>: Strike votes by union representing 1,378 teachers affected two districts. <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>: Strikes in two districts affected 501 teachers and 9,145 pupils in <LOCATION> Granite </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Farmer </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Mansfield </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Bellflower </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>: About 600 teachers, joined by bus drivers, ended a strike Tuesday night after school officials agreed to collective bargaining in Vermilion Parish, where a 6 percent pay cut was imposed in 1987.

 The death of an 11-year-old girl caught in a cross fire between rival drug-dealing street gangs has galvanized a <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> community `` like nothing else in years,'' one city official says. <PERSON> Tiffany </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, who had been sent away by her mother to live with relatives in the South because of the violence in her <LOCATION> Roxbury </LOCATION> neighborhood, was home for a visit when she was shot twice in the head Aug. 19 while sitting on a corner mailbox talking with friends. More than 400 people attended the funeral. In the weeks since the shooting, neighborhood leaders have met with the mayor and police commissioner to demand a war on crime. Some even suggested that the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> be called up. At meetings in the adjacent <LOCATION> Roxbury </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Dorchester </LOCATION> sections, people have developed proposals that include circulating the names and pictures of known drug dealers. Some activists have gathered hundreds of signatures on petitions calling for evening court sessions to handle drug-related cases. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Bolling </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Roxbury </LOCATION>'s representative in the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, said the shooting had `` galvanized this community ... like nothing else in years.'' In 29 years of law enforcement, said Deputy Police Superintendent <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Celester </PERSON>, `` I have never seen the cooperation I have seen in the past three weeks ... People are telling me to take the gloves off and take back the streets.'' <PERSON> Bolling </PERSON> suggested why the death of the girl had touched people so deeply. `` A little girl, totally innocent _ people can relate to that, because they think of their own families, and suddenly they recognize how vulnerable they are and how pervasive this problem has become,'' he said. Violence in <LOCATION> Roxbury </LOCATION> had captured the community's attention by the time of <PERSON> Tiffany </PERSON>'s killing. In July, two undercover state police troopers were wounded when they attempted to make a drug `` buy.'' Within hours of the two shootings, a <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> police office also was wounded, and police wounded a suspect in an unrelated shooting. A week after <PERSON> Tiffany </PERSON>'s death, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON>, 14, was fatally stabbed in front of his sister and other children. Police said the stabbing stemmed from an earlier fight and may have been connected to young gang activity. The pressure on police was intense to make quick arrests in the two killings. At one point, <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> police Commissioner <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> Roache </PERSON> publicly rejected the calls by activists to call in the National Guard. <PERSON> Roache </PERSON> said the city's 1,900-member police force could handle the situation. Thirty detectives were assigned full-time to hunt for <ORGANIZATION> Tiffany </ORGANIZATION>'s killers; within two weeks, they had arrested two suspects Four suspects were arrested in the 14-year-old boy's stabbing. Police also have assigned two police officers to walk the street in the <LOCATION> Roxbury </LOCATION> neighborhood where <PERSON> Tiffany </PERSON> was killed. Two years ago, the violence in <LOCATION> Roxbury </LOCATION> had so alarmed <PERSON> Tiffany </PERSON>'s mother that she sent <PERSON> Tiffany </PERSON> and an older sister to live with relatives in <LOCATION> Greenville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION> <PERSON> Tiffany </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> for a two-week visit with her mother; on Aug. 21, two days after the shooting, she was supposed to return to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> <PERSON> Alice </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, her mother, was upstairs in her apartment that hot night, lying on her bed and talking with a friend, when `` A little girl ran up and said <PERSON> Tiffany </PERSON> get shot and I ran down. `` I did n't take time to put on my shoes or lock my door or nothing, but when I got there, she was already dead. I was rubbing her skin and it was tightening up. I called her name and I called her name and she did n't say nothing.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, sitting in her living room under a tapestry of <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> and a portrait of Marthur Luther King Jr., said people cared about her daughter's death not just because she was so innocent but because she was special. <PERSON> Tiffany </PERSON>'s ambition, she said, was to become a doctor or teacher. She played the organ and trombone. She like to talk with her friends as they took turns braiding each other's hair. Mrs. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said she's talked with all the politicians, reporters and television crews who visit her apartment because `` It makes me feel like people care.'' Holding a diary <PERSON> Tiffany </PERSON> kept and looking at family snapshots, Mrs. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said: `` I was trying for them to be somebody, not just hanging on the street.''

 Burglars recently broke into the home of an elderly couple, ransacked the house and stabbed the wife. A few weeks later, a city councilman was found dead after exposing members of a car theft ring. On the surface, such incidents appear regrettably routine in a city with one of the world's highest crime rates. But in both cases officials admit the crimes were carried out by police. Hardly a day passes without newspapers reporting crimes of violence in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> and elsewhere that were carried out by the very people charged with protecting society. During the first seven months of 1988, 67 policemen were fired for involvement in crimes nationwide. Most were assigned in the <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> area. Of the 67 policemen, 18 were charged with murder, according to official figures. <PERSON> Cicero </PERSON> <PERSON> Campos </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, said his agency receives an average of 1,500 complaints each year of criminal activity among the country's 52,000 policemen. But he admits the figure represents `` the tip of the iceberg'' because the majority of crimes committed by police and soldiers are never reported. Much of the crime involves petty `` shakedowns.'' For example, traffic policemen extorting motorists for unauthorized, on-the-spot `` fines'' are a common sight on <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>'s busy thoroughfares. Last month, Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Ramon </PERSON> <PERSON> Montano </PERSON>, commander of the Philippine Constabulary, told a congressional committee that investigators recently cracked a massive car-theft ring made up mostly of soldiers and police. <PERSON> Montano </PERSON> said the arrests of the corrupt officers contributed to a significant reduction in the number of car thefts in the country. Poorly paid policemen often moonlight as bouncers for bars and prostitution fronts. Others join crime syndicates involved in gambling, narcotics and prostitution, either by guaranteeing them virtual immunity from arrest or, in some cases, serving as bodyguards for mob leaders. Policemen are widely assumed to have been involved in the unsolved slaying of leftist leaders. Five policemen have been charged with the attempted murder in June of leftist <PERSON> Nemesio </PERSON> <PERSON> Prudente </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Polytechnic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Philippines </ORGANIZATION>. The officers, who were on duty when they allegedly attacked <ORGANIZATION> Prudente </ORGANIZATION>, are scheduled for arraignment this month. Crimes committed by police rose to unprecedented levels during the 20-year rule of President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, who was ousted on Feb. 25, 1986, after a civilian-military uprising that propelled <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> to the presidency. Many soldiers and police joined the uprising against <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>. Once in office, Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> pledged to restore honest government and end abuses by police and soldiers. But the police department's image, as well as the government's own prestige, is now threatened by a resurgence of corruption <PERSON> Julie </PERSON> <PERSON> Yap </PERSON> <PERSON> Daza </PERSON>, a prominent newspaper and broadcast commentator, wrote in the <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> Standard that corruption has reached unacceptable levels. `` Police corruption is not unique to us, all right,'' she wrote. `` But this is corruption with a different face, the face of perversion ... It is a dark time for the good cops, if there are any left.'' <PERSON> Campos </PERSON>, a retired Constabulary brigadier general, blames the problem on low salaries. A patrolman receives a monthly starting salary of $ 50, well below the government's poverty line of $ 120 a month for a family of five. `` We do not have a coterie of angels or saints in the police force,'' he said in an interview. `` But certainly these people are all humans, and they are up for temptation. Perhaps what we can do is insulate them from temptation.'' He said the commission has recommended that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> increase police salaries as a step toward curbing corruption.

<HEAD>Warmup for Hecht-Bryan Battle in Nevada; Florida Voters Narrow

<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> voters were expected to set the stage today for Democratic Gov. <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON>'s drive to oust Republican Sen. Chic <PERSON> Hecht </PERSON>, while six <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> Democrats and two Republicans fought over the seat of retiring Sen. <PERSON> Lawton </PERSON> <PERSON> Chiles </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hecht </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> faced only token opposition in today's primaries, and for months they have been attacking each other <PERSON> Hecht </PERSON>, who is seeking his second term, has criticized the governor as too pro-labor. <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON>, in the middle of his second term, has charged <PERSON> Hecht </PERSON> with lacking credibility and being ineffective. A poll taken in August for the gaming industry showed <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> with a 14-point lead over <PERSON> Hecht </PERSON>, who six years ago narrowly defeated Democratic Sen. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Cannon </PERSON> after the incumbent was implicated in a <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> union scandal. <PERSON> Hecht </PERSON> has stopped releasing his own poll results but said he is closing the gap and considers the race a toss-up. <PERSON> Hecht </PERSON>, whose voting record is extremely conservative, has become known for his occasional verbal miscues, once referring to a `` nuclear suppository'' when he meant `` repository.'' A recent survey of <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> administrative assistants ranked him as the least effective senator in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hecht </PERSON>'s only primary opponent is <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Scheffler </PERSON>, 38-year-old owner of a graphics business in <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON> who said he would press for reprocessing nuclear waste brought to <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> so that only low-level, less radioactive waste would remain. <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON>'s opponents in the Democratic primary are <LOCATION> Manford </LOCATION> `` Cave Rock Manny'' <PERSON> Beals </PERSON>, <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzpatrick </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Kepler </PERSON>. In <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, a two-man Republican primary matched Rep. <PERSON> Connie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mack </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, grandson of the legendary <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> A's baseball manager, against former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Merkle </PERSON>, who successfully prosecuted Colombian cocaine kingpin <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivas </PERSON>. <PERSON> Merkle </PERSON> entered the race late, in June, and <PERSON> Mack </PERSON> was heavily favored in pre-election polls after outspending his rival by about $ 2.2 million to $ 100,000. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and former Marine Lt. Col. <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> made appearances for <PERSON> Mack </PERSON>, who has one of the most conservative records in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Merkle </PERSON> was frustrated by <PERSON> Mack </PERSON>'s refusal to debate, and emphasized that point by carrying around a life-size replica of <PERSON> Mack </PERSON> he called `` Cardboard Connie.'' `` If he debates me, he knows the jig's up,'' said <PERSON> Merkle </PERSON>. `` He'd be forced to discuss issues ... People would see the lights are on but nobody's home.'' <PERSON> Mack </PERSON> said <PERSON> Merkle </PERSON> was n't `` a viable candidate,'' and that there was no reason `` to have been drawn into his campaign. My feeling was that we should continue with delivery of the message we started with in October, talking about the importance of freedom, free markets, less taxes, freedom as an objective of foreign policy.'' For the Democrats, state Insurance Commissioner <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Gunter </PERSON> appeared to hold a wide lead, but not wide enough to win a majority and avoid an Oct. 4 runoff with the second-place finisher. Others in the race were Reps. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mica </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> `` Buddy'' McKay, state Sen. <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, former Republican Gov. <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> and former <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> postal clerk <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Rader </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gunter </PERSON>, who lost to <PERSON> Paula </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON> in the 1980 <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> race, raised $ 1 million within six weeks of announcing, and opponents noted he took at least $ 160,000 from the insurance industry he regulates. <PERSON> MacKay </PERSON> campaign manager <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Farmer </PERSON> called <PERSON> Gunter </PERSON>'s department `` a saga of sleaze. The early Democratic frontrunner, former Gov. <PERSON> Reubin </PERSON> <PERSON> Askew </PERSON>, quit the race in May, saying running for office had become too expensive. Democrats acknowledge that their crowded field and likely runoff may hurt their prospects in November. `` I do n't think it'll be an easy race, but I think it's winnable,'' said <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitehead </PERSON>

<HEAD>Soviet Olympic Medalists Will Collect Cash in Seoul</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Soviets athletes who win gold medals at the <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> Olympics will be awarded the equivalent of $ 19,000 for their efforts, the head of the Soviet Olympic Committee says. <PERSON> Marat </PERSON> <PERSON> Gramov </PERSON> announced the new policy at a news conference Monday and denied such payments conflict with the purely amateur status Soviet athletes purportedly possess. He said those on the 550-member Soviet team in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> who win gold medals will be paid 12,000 rubles -LRB- $ 19,047 -RRB-. Silver medalists will receive 5,000 rubles, and bronze medalists will collect 3,000 rubles. Those are handsome sums in a country where the average monthly wage for a factory worker is around 200 rubles. According to <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Dmitrieyev </PERSON>, deputy foreign editor of the daily newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Sovietsky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sport </ORGANIZATION>, the sums earmarked for <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> medalists will be the largest ever paid to Soviet victors in a Summer Games. `` If they received $ 100 in the past, it was considered a large sum,'' <PERSON> Dmitrieyev </PERSON> said in a telephone interview, referring to payments made to Soviet participants in the 1976 <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> and 1980 <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> games.

<HEAD>Christian Leaders And Universal Cash In On `Last Temptation'</HEAD>

<DATELINE>HOLLYWOOD (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 `` The Last Temptation of Christ'' has proven to be a blessing for conservative Christians. Denounced by its critics as blasphemous and profane, the movie about a Jesus with human frailties not only has energized the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> right; it has revived stagnant fund-raising, <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> leaders say. The movie `` has helped our ministry more than anything else before,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Wildmon </PERSON>, leader of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Family </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. Said <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Beehler </PERSON>, director of communications for Campus Crusade for Christ: `` This gives us a wonderful opportunity to talk about the real <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Christ </PERSON>. ... We're taking lemons and making lemonade.'' At the same time, filmgoers are not avoiding the movie, as Christian leaders had hoped. In fact, the controversy seems to have prompted more people to see it. That price, though, might be a small one for <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> activists. Beset by negative publicity from the <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> scandals, conservative Christians have used `` Last Temptation'' as a lightning rod around which to organize and raise money. In addition to bringing together fundamentalists, Pentecostals, Prostestants and Catholics, the controversy makes for a natural fund-raiser: It pits the conservative Christian organizations, which often depict themselves as small and struggling, against a <ORGANIZATION> Hollywood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Goliath </ORGANIZATION>. The Concerned Women for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, in a fund-raising letter, said, `` Your gift of $ 100, $ 75, $ 50, $ 20 _ or whatever amount _ is sorely needed. We need your financial help to fight these rich <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> moguls.'' Similarly, the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Family </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> has said that those `` giving $ 15 or more to help AFA oppose the movie will receive a one year subscription to the <ORGANIZATION> AFA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION>.'' `` <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON> has been preaching about the movie for the last three weeks,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hymers </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> minister who has been one of the movie's most outspoken critics. `` <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON>'s doing a tremendous fund-rasing job through the film. The American Society for the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tradition </ORGANIZATION>, Family and Property used a four-page, full-color attack on the movie to solicit small contributions. `` People have put their money where their values are,'' said <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Drake </PERSON>, president of the organization. <PERSON> Drake </PERSON> said that a phone campaign brought in $ 39,000, enough for a full-page advertisement in The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Times against the movie. It also may be true that some Christian-themed organizations are trying to exploit the controversy for less-than-noble purposes. `` I've seen the fund-raising letters. -LRB- The movie -RRB- has become another hype button to raise funds,'' said <PERSON> Cal </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, a syndicated columnist and former comunications director for the Moral Majority. <ORGANIZATION> Universal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION>, meanwhile, appears to have benefited from the controversy. By telling people not to see the movie, <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> leaders may have encouraged the opposite response. `` Universal is raking in the dough,'' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said. Studio officials refused comment. Although `` Last Temptation'' is by no means a blockbuster, it has done respectable business for an art film, grossing more than $ 2 million since its limited release Aug. 12. `` It would n't have done anywhere near what's it's done without the controversy,'' said <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Block </PERSON>, editor of the industry newsletter Sow Biz News. `` Although some Christians might have stayed away, many other -LRB- filmgoers -RRB- went because of the controversy. People say, ` If they tell me I ca n't go, I'll go.''' At the same time, production plans for at least one movie with a Christian theme are not being stalled by the flap: `` Christ the Man,'' to be directed by <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Verhoeven </PERSON>, is in the planning stages at <PERSON> Mel </PERSON> <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON>' production company. Described by company spokeswoman <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Auerbach </PERSON> as a serious interpretation of <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON>' life, the movie will be `` absolutely unaffected'' by criticisms of `` Last Temptation.'' It is too early to tell if the attacks on <ORGANIZATION> Universal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION> will lead to any long-term losses, though <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> leaders are hopeful. `` What we're sensing is a lot of people _ in the tens of millions _ who are now angry at Universal,'' said <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Penland </PERSON>, who served as a consultant to film producer <ORGANIZATION> Universal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION> before becoming a leading critic of the movie. <PERSON> Wildmon </PERSON> and other activists will soon launch a boycott against Universal's videocassette of `` E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial,'' due out Oct. 27. After that, there are no announced plans aimed at Universal. But, said <PERSON> Beehler </PERSON>, `` Universal will always be remembered as the studio that made a film defaming <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Christ </PERSON>.''

 Fire trucks from as far away as <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> took position in two smoke-filled <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> towns Monday and residents here waited to see if a backfire would burn fast enough to protect them from a wind-driven forest fire. `` First it starts snowing ash. Then it starts raining fire,'' said fire information officer <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaunert </PERSON> as he stood in a 65-foot-wide fire break bulldozed through the forest. Top federal officials said that blaze and 12 other fires in and around <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> had burned 900,000 acres as of Monday. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Cargill </PERSON>, chief federal forester for the <LOCATION> Rocky </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION>, warned that an additional 300,000 acres may be consumed this week, despite the efforts of 9,000 firefighters. And <ORGANIZATION> Cargill </ORGANIZATION> warned that 20 to 30 mph southwesterly wind is expected to arrive in the region Tuesday with a weather front. Protection of life and property are the top priorities, he said at a news conference in <LOCATION> Bozeman </LOCATION>. `` Containment of further acreage is just not in the cards.'' He said many of the nation's best firefighters `` are being whipped day after day'' by the Yellowstone fires. Evacuation orders for <ORGANIZATION> Cooke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> and a town three miles west, <LOCATION> Silver </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gate </LOCATION>, were issued Sunday morning. By Monday night, about 30 of the approximately 150 residents in the two towns remained, said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Fry </PERSON>, an emergency services official. `` Some of them are staying around because they want to see what the fire does,'' Fry said. `` They're mostly packed up, though, and we're trying to push them out.'' A backfire had been set by firefighters as a shield against the approaching <ORGANIZATION> Storm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Creek </ORGANIZATION> fire Sunday just a half-mile from Silver Gate. Firefighters wanted to establish a two-mile buffer of charred forest between Silver Gate and the 61,300-acre Storm Creek fire. But by Monday, the backfire had burned only a half-mile swath, said fire information officer <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Comstock </PERSON>. `` With an 18 to 20 mph wind behind the fire, that line would n't stop it You'd just stand there in the line and watch it go over your head,'' he said. And if the backfire had n't gone far enough, the wind would blow embers from the backfire itself into residential areas, endangering the town it was meant to protect. To prepare for that possibility, fire trucks rolled into positions around the two towns. About 75 trucks were called in from as far as <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> to protect buildings, <PERSON> Comstock </PERSON> said. `` We're here till they tell us to get out of <ORGANIZATION> Dodge </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <PERSON> Ty </PERSON> <PERSON> Ripley </PERSON>, manning a fire truck from the eastern <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Glendive </LOCATION>, 400 miles away. <PERSON> Comstock </PERSON> said firefighters also were worried that the Storm Creek fire and three other major fires in and around <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> have created their own wind circulation, `` almost like a whirlpool of wind,'' around the <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Basin </LOCATION>. That circular wind pattern may encourage the fires to reach out toward each other, which could create a huge ring of flame that would eat its way inward through unburned forests, <PERSON> Comstock </PERSON> said. Also inside <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION>, firefighters worried that the expected wind would blow the 141,900-acre North Fork fire back toward the complex of visitor facilities around Old Faithful Geyser. But <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Iobst </PERSON>, a fire information officer, said a lack of vegetation in the Old Faithful area would make it easy to protect the development. On the western side of the park, which is largely in <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, fire officials were confident they could protect <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mont. </LOCATION>, a community of 750 people, from an advancing lobe of the North Fork fire just 2 -LCB- miles away Monday. `` Everything is based on what these winds do to us in a couple of days,'' said <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Avery </PERSON>, a senior <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> fire oficial, referring to the anticipated southwesterly wind. About 30 miles to the west in the <ORGANIZATION> Targhee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION>, about 55 firefighters battled a new 25-acre blaze believed caused by humans. The fire burned to within 50 yards of half dozen summer homes near <ORGANIZATION> Macks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inn </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, but the winds pushed the flames in the opposite direction, fire commander <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Bushnell </PERSON> said. In the northern Rockies, officials warned that an approaching weather front could drive existing blazes past fire lines and cause fires already brought under control to flare up again. The weather predictions prompted <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> officials to begin work on an evacuation plan for permanent and summer residences south of <LOCATION> Fortine </LOCATION>, in northwestern <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>. The Dry Fork fire there has scorched 12,300 acres. `` Right now, we've got our fingers crossed that this wind is n't going to be that harsh,'' said fire information officer <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Guth </PERSON> That fire is considered about 60 percent contained. Elsewhere, calmer wind and slightly lower temperatures Monday helped firefighters grapple with blazes that charred nearly 21,000 acres of southern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> brush. Oregon's largest fire of the season was nearly contained at just under 57,000 acres in the rugged Hell's <ORGANIZATION> Canyon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Recreation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Area </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Booth </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON> activated the National Guard to help provide support and transportation for hundreds of firefighters. Containment of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s largest fire, the 12,500-acre White Mountain Complex in Ferry County, was at least five days away, officials said Monday, but it had stopped moving toward the town of <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, air tankers and fire crews scrambled Monday to stop a runaway brush fire moving toward the northern <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> community of Paradise, authorities said. `` Right now they've got a problem,'' said <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Jo </PERSON> <PERSON> Pollock </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Interagency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman. `` They've got a 250-acre fire heading for the town. It just broke out a little while ago.'' The fire was the latest in a series of fires raging on <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>'s tinder-dry landscape Monday Air tankers that had been used for a 5,400-acre brush fire near <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> were diverted to the fire near <LOCATION> Paradise </LOCATION>, a community of about 500 residents between <LOCATION> Ogden </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Logan </LOCATION> in the <ORGANIZATION> Wasatch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION>. Forests also burned in <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Report: US Schools Lack Adequate Computers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Education Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 American schools have only one computer for every 30 students and even those pupils with access to computers get to use them an average of just one hour a week, a report to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> said today. The report by the <ORGANIZATION> congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assessment </ORGANIZATION> said `` today's classrooms typically resemble their ancestors of 50 years ago more closely than operating rooms or business offices resemble their 1938 versions.'' The agency estimated that schools have spent $ 2 billion on computer hardware over the past decade. There are now 1.2 million to 1.7 million computers in public schools, and fewer than 5 percent have no computers. But the agency said it would cost $ 4 billion to buy enough equipment to reduce the student-computer ratio from 30-1 to 3-1. The 246-page report, based on two years' research, said that between 1981 and 1987 the percentage of schools equipped with computers for instructional use grew from 18 percent to 95 percent. But `` the vast majority of schools still do not have enough of them to make the computer a central element of instruction,'' it said. Computers are not the only new machines in American classrooms. `` The 1980s witnessed a tremendous expansion in school use of advanced technology of all types,'' the report said. `` In 1980 very few schools had videocassette recorders. Today roughly 90 percent do,'' it said, adding that the availability of cable and satellite transmission has made the television a more potent teaching tool _ especially for schools in remote areas. `` In practice there is wide disparity _ one computer in a classroom, clusters of computers in the library or classrooms, full computer laboratories and classrooms with no computers,'' it said. `` Not all students use computers and ... those who do spend on average a little more than one hour per week on the computer.'' The report said that `` although new interactive technologies can not alone solve the problems of American education, they have already contributed to important improvements in learning. These tools can plan an even greater role ... both by helping children acquire basic skills and by endowing them with more sophisticated skills so they can acquire and apply knowledge over their lifetimes.'' To tap the potential of technology, the report said, `` a greater investment will be necessary,'' including a more active federal role in spurring research and helping spread the new teaching tools. The report warned that `` the vast majority of those now teaching or planning to teach have had little or no computer education or training.'' Most of what they have been taught is to how to use computers themselves, not how to teach with computers. `` Despite a nationwide call to improve teaching, there is almost no federal money for the training of new teachers,'' it said. It said there are more than 10,000 educational software products on the market, but the quality `` could be much better.'' The Office of Technology Assessment is a nonpartisan analytical agency for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Rep. <PERSON> Augustus </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON>, D-Calif., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION>, which commissioned the study, said increasing federal support for high-tech school aids `` would be good public policy and a wise investment for the future. The report cited several examples of schools putting computers and other gear to good use, including: _ <ORGANIZATION> Poteet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Mesquite </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, where interactive videodiscs are used throughout the physical science curriculum, allowing ninth graders to bring a volcanic eruption or solar flare to life at the touch of a computer keyboard _ Sacred <ORGANIZATION> Heart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Model </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, where fifth graders recently assembled a computer database of their pets -LRB- including 25 dogs, 4 hermit crabs and 1 guinea pig -RRB- and are currently testing the acidity of the city's tap water for a comparison with data from 199 other schools around the world

<HEAD>Hay Prices Highest Ever</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The drought-toasted 1988 hay crop is expected to be the smallest in 12 years and prices are likely to be the highest since the Agriculture Department began keeping annual figures in 1909. Preliminary figures show that hay prices at the farm in August averaged $ 83.10 per ton. Although that was unchanged from July, it was an increase of 35 percent from $ 61.60 per ton in August 1987. No dramatic declines in hay prices are in sight, say department economists. The supply is tight and demand is strong, meaning that prices probably will remain high until spring. According to <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> records, the record for hay prices over an entire season was $ 75.80 per ton set in 1983, another drought year. That was an increase of less than 10 percent from the 1982 average of $ 69.30 per ton. Historically, however, there have been larger year-to-year percentage jumps in hay prices. In 1934, for example, hay rose 52 percent to $ 11.70 per ton from $ 7.70 in 1933. But a year later, in 1935, prices plummeted just as fast to $ 7.60 per ton. The latest <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> production estimate on Aug. 11 put this year's hay harvest at 130.5 million tons on 66.2 million acres, down 12.5 percent from 1987 production of 149.1 million tons on 60.7 million acres It also is the smallest since the 1976 crop of 120.1 million tons, says the department's <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> in a new outlook report on the feed situation. `` Acreage harvested as reported in the August crop production report is almost 2.8 million acres more than the area indicated for harvest in the July report,'' the agency said. `` This increase likely reflects in part the emergency haying rules -LRB- for conservation land -RRB- under <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s drought assistance measures.'' At the beginning of the hay marketing year on May 1, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> inventory was estimated at 27.3 million tons. Counting this year's production, that makes a total hay supply of 157.8 million tons for 1988-89, down 13 percent from last season Meanwhile, the number of cattle and other `` roughage consuming animal units'' will be about the same as last year, meaning there will be less to go around. If each animal eats as much hay as it did last year, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> hay stockpile will be chewed down to only 3.8 million tons by May 1, 1989, a record low. Thus, the report said, it seems more reasonable that producers will reduce hay portions to ration available supplies. `` Hay use will depend on a number of additional factors,'' the report said. `` Silage yields will be sharply reduced by the drought. However, the area of silage harvested likely will be increased, because of abandonment of areas intended for harvest as grain.'' The report added: `` More straw likely will be baled this year to stretch out forage supplies. Fall pasture growth, or lack thereof, and spring pasture conditions also will be important to hay use. Good fall rains and pasture, and good early spring pasture would do a lot to ease the pressure on hay supplies.'' On the other hand, `` converse conditions would intensify supply pressures'' and push up hay prices even further, it said.

 Farm-raised catfish production continues to rise above year-earlier levels, according to <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reports. In July, production was an estimated 23.7 million pounds of live weight delivered to processors, the department reports. The July average price paid to growers was 80 cents per pound, up 19 cents from the same month in 1987. So far this year, production was about 169.7 million pounds, up from 160.4 million pounds through July 1987. In a related report, <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> said catfish farmers in 18 states had sales worth $ 247 million last year. It was the first such survey since 1981, when sales were $ 72 million, officials said. Of the 1987 sales total, hatchery operations accounted for $ 20.1 million, while sales from production were reported at $ 226.8 million. Last year's catfish sales, all sizes, were led by <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> at $ 178.5 million, compared with $ 44.7 million in 1981.

<HEAD>Average Cost of Lawyer for Poor Defendant Now $223</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> says it now costs an average of $ 223 to provide legal representation for a poor criminal defendant, and the number requiring such services has risen sharply since 1982. The <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION> said Monday the $ 223 cost, the average in 1986, is up from $ 196 per case in 1982. The caseload rose to nearly 4.5 million, up about 40 percent from the 3.2 million cases four years earlier, the bureau said in a report. The 50 states and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, spent a combined $ 991 million for indigent defendants in 1986, compared to $ 625 million in 1982 _ an increase of 60 percent. The programs are financed by state, county and local governments in each state. The rights of poor criminal defendants to legal representation were spelled out in a number of <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> rulings beginning in 1932. One case was the landmark <PERSON> Gideon </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wainright </PERSON> in 1963, when the court extended the right to counsel in state courts to all indigent defendants charged with a felony. Some states have expanded the program to include representation for proceedings involving parole, probation, parental rights, civil commitment and post-conviction matters. The department said <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> spent the least for indigent defendants _ an average of 69 cents per state resident. The District of <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> spent the most, $ 29 per capita. The average per capita expenditure nationwide was $ 4.11 in 1986, up from $ 2.76 in 1982. When average costs per indigent case were computed, <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> again was last, spending $ 63 per case in 1986. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> was first, spending an average of $ 540. There are three basic programs used to provide the legal services. Assigned counsel programs feature case-by-case appointments of lawyers; in contract programs, the government contracts with individual lawyers, law firms or local bar associations to provide services for a given period; and in public defender programs, a salaried staff is hired to provide legal services. The report was an update to a 1982 study on indigent defendants. Since the initial study, the report said, there was a movement from county to state financing; an increase in rates of compensation paid to private lawyers, and expanded use of contracts for providing representation to the poor. Here are the total state-by-state expenditures -LRB- including <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> -RRB- in 1986, in millions; the per capita expenditure in actual dollars; and the state's ranking in per capita spending: <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, $ 6.1 million, $ 1.52, 44; <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, $ 6.8 million, $ 12.91, 2; <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> $ 16.2 million, $ 4.89, 10; <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, $ 1.6 million, 69 cents, 51; <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, $ 251.5 million, $ 9.32, 3; <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, $ 12.1 million, $ 3.71, 21; <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, $ 9.2 million, $ 2.90, 25; <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>, $ 2.7 million, $ 4.34, 14; <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION>, $ 18 million, $ 28.90, 1; <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, $ 82.1 million, $ 7.03, 5. <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, $ 8.3 million, $ 1.36, 47; <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, $ 4.3 million, $ 4.13, 18; <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, $ 2.6 million, $ 2.62, 28; <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, $ 33.1 million, $ 2.87, 26; <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, $ 10.9 million, $ 1.99, 37; <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, $ 11.5 million, $ 4.05, 20; <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, $ 4.2 million, $ 1.73, 41; <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, $ 7.6 million, $ 2.06, 36; <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, $ 10.8 million, $ 2.41, 34; <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, $ 1.9 million, $ 1.67, 42. <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, $ 20 million, $ 4.49, 13; <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, $ 20.7 million, $ 3.56, 22; <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, $ 43.6 million, $ 4.77, 11; <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, $ 14.1 million, $ 3.36, 24; <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, $ 2.9 million, $ 1.11, 50; <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, $ 6.7 million, $ 1.33, 49; <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, $ 4.2 million, $ 5.15, 8; <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>, $ 4.3 million, $ 2.71, 27; <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>, $ 6.3 million, $ 6.63, 6. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, $ 4.3 million, $ 4.22, 16; <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, $ 31 million, $ 4.07, 19; <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, $ 6.2 million, $ 4.25, 15; <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, $ 111.6 million, $ 6.28, 7; <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, $ 16.4 million, $ 2.60, 29; <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, $ 1.2 million, $ 1.81, 39; <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, $ 26.5 million, $ 2.47, 32; <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, $ 4.4 million, $ 1.36, 48.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: Whistle-Blower's Victory May Not Bode Well For

<TEXT>
 A victory that could give $ 800,000 to a fired government whistle-blower sets precedents that he and his lawyers fear will make it riskier for other federal employees to expose waste and hazards. <PERSON> Bertrand </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Berube </PERSON>, fired in 1983 after he accused the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> of becoming `` the nation's slumlord,'' said he will take early retirement in a settlement with the agency. He had been <ORGANIZATION> GSA </ORGANIZATION>'s top regional director, overseeing all major government buildings in the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, area. Despite the settlement ordered by the <ORGANIZATION> Merit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Berube </PERSON> said laws are needed to prevent the government from punishing other employees who disclose overspending and dangerous conditions and that the federal system to protect such whistle-blowers actually worked against him. <PERSON> Berube </PERSON>, who says he is the highest ranking civil servant ever fired for whistle-blowing, said federal employees should not think they can duplicate what he did unless they have several hundred thousand dollars to spend on attorneys. He was defended by a public interest group that can afford to back only a fraction of those who go against government employers, he said. `` If a government employee has that kind of money, they're usually not working for the government,'' said <PERSON> Berube </PERSON> Those who think they can get help from the special government counsel set up to protect whistle-blowers may find `` they're going to the executioner when they think they're going to the doctor,'' he said. The special counsel for the merit board refused to take his case and ended up testifying in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> against him, saying there were other grounds for firing him besides his criticism of waste, fire danger and health hazards in federal buildings, <PERSON> Berube </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> GSA </ORGANIZATION> had claimed that <PERSON> Berube </PERSON>, who earned $ 64,000 a year overseeing 7,000 employees, engaged in `` irresponsible sensationalism'' in describing <ORGANIZATION> GSA </ORGANIZATION>'s problems. <PERSON> Herb </PERSON> <PERSON> Koster </PERSON>, a spokesman for <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Carmen </PERSON>, former <ORGANIZATION> GSA </ORGANIZATION> administrator who fired <PERSON> Berube </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Carmen </PERSON> would not comment on the settlement signed Aug. 18. <PERSON> Carmen </PERSON> now heads the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Asset </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disposition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> GSA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Costello </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> GSA </ORGANIZATION> officials also had no comment on the agreement. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Devine </PERSON>, legal director for the Government Accountability Project which represents <PERSON> Berube </PERSON> and other government and private industry whistle-blowers, said rulings by the merit board during its consideration of <PERSON> Berube </PERSON>'s case further inhibit whistle-blowing. `` Under the <PERSON> Berube </PERSON> standards, agencies have everything to gain and nothing to lose by opening up a witch hunt on a whistle-blower,'' he said. <PERSON> Devine </PERSON> said that under the precedent, government agencies are allowed to look after-the-fact for reasons to justify a dismissal. The <PERSON> Berube </PERSON> settlement agreement with <ORGANIZATION> GSA </ORGANIZATION> precludes further appeal by either side and says the settlement does not assume any `` unlawful personnel practice, discrimination, reprisal or any other unlawful or illegal acts'' by the agency or its officials. <PERSON> Devine </PERSON> said neither the merit board nor the courts have done anything to discourage government reprisals against whistle-blowing employees. The merit board's office of special counsel, which was set up to represent whistle-blowers, `` actually has been a <LOCATION> Troan </LOCATION> horse for civil servants who commit the truth,'' he said. <PERSON> Berube </PERSON> said in a telephone interview over the weekend that problems with government buildings have gotten `` worse rather than better'' since he was fired, with many buildings in serious disrepair while money is wasted. In a May 1983 memo, he had said 25 percent of <ORGANIZATION> GSA </ORGANIZATION> buildings were unsafe and `` for all practical purposes, we're becoming the nation's slumlord.'' <PERSON> Berube </PERSON> said he agreed not to go back to the agency so he could continue his successful woodworking business in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and continue to fight for whistle-blower legislation. <ORGANIZATION> GSA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Costello </PERSON> said Friday that a check for $ 530,000 would shortly be made out to <PERSON> Berube </PERSON> and his lawyers. <PERSON> Berube </PERSON>, 55, said that after legal fees he will get about $ 350,000, along with up to $ 430,000 in additional retirement pay based on his normal life expectancy. Lawyers said <ORGANIZATION> GSA </ORGANIZATION> also will have to pay $ 24,000 into <PERSON> Berube </PERSON>'s retirement account and reimburse the $ 6,000 paid him in unemployment compensation. <PERSON> Berube </PERSON> said he would retire with a $ 32,500 annual pension, based on 26 years of government service, including the five years since he was fired. <PERSON> Berube </PERSON> said that without the settlement he would have received annual retirement pay of $ 18,000 when he turns 65. A whistle-blower protection bill has passed the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. House leaders are discussing whether to consider similar legislation passed by a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> committee or a <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration bill opposed by whistle-blowers.

<HEAD>Brady's Wife Says Reagan Reaffirms Support for Gun Wait Period</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, whose husband was shot along with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, says <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> recently reaffirmed to her that he supports a mandatory waiting period for the purchase of handguns. The wife of presidential press secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> said she reminded <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in a telephone conversation that <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hinckley </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> shot him and <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> in March 1981 with a gun purchased in a state _ <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> _ without a waiting period. Mrs. <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> endorsed the concept of a federal waiting period, but not the specific language in a comprehensive anti-drug bill that the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> will consider this week _ and likely pass. `` He recognized the need for federal legislation,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> said, after she told him that states `` are not doing the job'' in stopping drug dealers from obtaining handguns. Debate on the overall drug bill begins Wednesday, and a final vote could take place Friday. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> will then follow with its own drug bill and the two versions would eventually be merged into final legislation. The House bill as introduced would carry a $ 1.5 billion to $ 2 billion annual price tag, money that would be added to the $ 3.9 billion a year the federal government is now spending to fight drug use. The legislation includes something for everyone involved in fighting illegal drugs: more money for education, treatment and rehabilitation; more resources for state and local law enforcement efforts to seize drugs on land, in the air and on the seas. Strict controls would be placed for the first time on the chemicals used as raw materials in the manufacture of heroin and cocaine. There will be controversies over Republican-inspired amendments for a federal death penalty against those who kill during a drug crime; a `` good faith'' exception that would allow use of illegally seized drug evidence in court, and denial of many federal benefits for convicted drug users. The gun language would require a seven-day wait in the purchase of a handgun from a licensed dealer. The dealer must send law enforcement authorities a sworn statement that includes a description of the gun, the serial number, the name, address and birth date of the buyer. Police may, but are not required, to conduct a background check. Purchasers who would be denied the pistol would be those already ineligible under existing federal law: convicted felons, fugitives from justice, illegal aliens, drug addicts, those adjudicated mentally ill or committed to a mental institution, those dishonorably discharged from the military and people under indictment for a felony. Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> McCollum </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Fla </LOCATION>., said he will offer an amendment to substitute a requirement that the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> establish a computerized system to identify felons trying to purchase handguns Access would be provided to local police and firearms dealers. `` I do n't think you should have a waiting period when it abridges the right to buy a gun'' for a law-abiding citizen, <PERSON> McCollum </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> first weighed in on the subject of waiting periods on June 21. The former <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> governor spoke favorably of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s 15-day waiting period with a mandatory background check, and added, `` Now, I would like to see that generally. I think that all states ought to take a look at that system.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, who became a gun-control activist after her husband's shooting, said she wrote <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> thanking him for the remarks, and he called her a week later. She brought up the federal waiting period during the conversation. `` He wished it could be handled by the states,'' she said, but added that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was willing to have a federal law `` because of the overwhelming problem'' of drug dealers and other criminals obtaining guns. `` I told him we were trying to get that attached to the drug bill,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> said. `` I told him there is overwhelming evidence through the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alcohol </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Firearms </ORGANIZATION> that guns used in crimes are traced back to states where there is no waiting period. I indicated <PERSON> Hinckley </PERSON>'s gun came from a state, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, where there is no waiting period.'' Other key provisions of the drug bill would: _ Require states to automatically `` pass through'' anti-drug money to local governments _ Revise banking laws to allow the government to closely watch institutions where drug money might be laundered _ Require recipients of federal grants or contracts to maintain a drug-free workplace _ Provide money for drug education, treatment and rehabilitation for AIDS victims and groups with a high risk of getting the disease _ Authorize $ 10 million for a Latin American regional anti-drug force if one is approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION>

<HEAD>Time Running Out on Environmental Bills</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has left itself about a month to solve major environmental problems that have eluded solution in the 1980s _ redoubling the battle against urban air pollution and launching an attack on acid rain. Lawmakers return to town Wednesday, shooting for an early October adjournment. As the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> enter the home stretch, clean air legislation is barely out of the starting gate. Neither chamber has even scheduled debate on the Clean Air Act revisions that are being watched closely by some 100 cities and metropolitan areas that failed to meet last December's deadline for bringing ozone and carbon monoxide levels within national health standards. A comprehensive package to control urban smog, acid rain and airborne toxic chemicals was ready for <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> debate last November, but it has been stalled by a variety of opponents, most notably Majority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, D-W. The package's principal sponsor, Sen. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, has been trying to negotiate floor time with <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> has said that if necessary, he will offer his air bill as an amendment to must-pass legislation. In the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, serious closed-door negotiations among leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> did n't begin until this summer, leaving little time to get a complicated proposal ready for the floor. Any package produced by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would most likely give cities more time to clean up their air but also require tougher actions to combat pollution, from local driving restrictions to stricter emissions standards for vehicles. Debate, a good bit of it in scientific terms, centers on how much more time will be granted and just what corrective steps will be required. A complicating factor is that the nation has already employed the measures that can bring large and quick reductions in pollution. Acid rain control is simpler scientifically but far more complicated economically and geographically. Acid rain, a byproduct of coal-burning factories and power plants, is a major concern of the East, which is downwind from the industrial <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>. Just who pays to clean up Midwestern emissions is a major question, with many Western lawmakers cool to a national subsidy for Midwestern cleanup costs. <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> not only has power plants in his state that would have to reduce their emissions, his state has huge deposits of high sulfur coal that could lose its market to cleaner burning coal from other states under an acid rain control bill. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has a fallback option if it fails to produce clean air legislation. It can, as it did last December, pass another stopgap bill that would prevent the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> from taking action against areas not meeting the standards. The environment surfaced as an issue last week in the presidential race between Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> claimed to be highly committed to a cleaner environment, although the record of the Reagan-Bush administration has been given dismal marks by environmental groups. The clean air fight is at the top of the environment-conservation agenda for the 100th <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, but other issues are vying for attention in the closing weeks of the election-year session. One that might not take much time is the early 1987 request by the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration and the oil industry to allow petroleum exploration in the <ORGANIZATION> Arctic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Refuge </ORGANIZATION> on <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s north coast The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Merchant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> and Fisheries committees have endorsed drilling bills, but the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, where the environmental lobby has more clout, is sitting on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> bill. Likely to emerge from <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> after a four-year struggle is a renewal of the Endangered Species Act authorizing a 50 percent increase in program spending in the early 1990s. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is also ready to pass a $ 9.8 billion fiscal 1989 spending bill for the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and other land and resource agencies. It is drawing veto threats because it would delay spending for clean-coal technology research and bar oil leasing off portions of the coasts of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. House and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> negotiators are putting the finishing touches on legislation that would encourage the use of less-polluting methanol, ethanol and natural gas as alternatives to imported petroleum for powering vehicles. Awaiting Senate action are House-passed bills that would reorganize the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> to make its director independent of political appointees in the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>; cut back on commercial timbering in the <ORGANIZATION> Tongass </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>; and prevent a shopping center from being built adjacent to the <LOCATION> Manassas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> National </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Battlefield </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> in northern <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>.

The <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> senator delivered a Labor Day tribute Monday to the Pledge of Allegiance, which the Republicans have attempted to turn into a political weapon against <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> presidential nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> blasted <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for vetoing a <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> bill that would have penalized teachers who did not lead their students in the pledge. The values embodied in the pledge `` deserve to be transmitted to our children,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said. `` To us, they are not hokey or cornball or passe,'' he said. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> also toured <LOCATION> Ellis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, where millions of immigrants entered the country and which is now undergoing restoration. The Quayles are of Scottish descent and their relatives did not come through <LOCATION> Ellis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. But the couple and their three children posed for photographs anyway with a group of people dressed in costumes of their native countries. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s speech at the base of <LOCATION> Lady </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Liberty </LOCATION>, with the <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> skyline in the background and <LOCATION> Ellis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> nearby, was planned as a moving kickoff to the countdown to Election Day. But it was disrupted briefly by about 30 demonstrators, members of a coalition that believes the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration and <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> have not done enough in the fight against AIDS. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s aides said later that the senator had an `` exemplary record'' on AIDS issues and had recently voted to provide $ 1.2 billion in funding for AIDS research, education and prevention. The demonstrators, however, said <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> voted against legislation to give the experimental drug AZT to AIDS victims. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s speech outlined what will be his themes this fall: the economy is doing well, inflation and interest rates are under control, and earnings and job growth are up. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s task will be to sell the voters on the idea that they will enjoy a bright future if they stick with the Republicans, according to campaign strategists. That was the message <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> had for the Liberty Island crowd. `` We will win this election because we are the party of the future. We believe in our families. We believe in the future and we believe in preserving freedom in this country. We will never let it go,'' he said. It was the same message <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> worked on last week during his Southern campaign swing, speaking before largely sympathetic audiences on conservative college campuses and elsewhere in the deep South. But <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> is also beginning to get some less receptive crowds as he ventures outside conservative territory. On Monday, he got a mixed reception when he dropped into <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> to address Polish-Americans after a parade. The audience booed and heckled him as he spoke, although he did get a cheer when he declared, `` We will never give up until there's freedom again in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>.''

 The federal government's $ 2 billion bailout of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stockton </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, will be the most costly rescue ever of a single savings institution. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> announced the plan on Monday, with chairman <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Wall </PERSON> saying the agency will provide $ 500 million in promissory notes and at least another $ 1.5 billion in cash assistance over the next 10 years. The <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> S & amp; L was the nation's largest insolvent savings institution. The largest previous rescue of a single savings and loan was the $ 1.3 billion infusion last November into <ORGANIZATION> Vernon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Robert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> M. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bass </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, will infuse $ 550 million in private funds and assume control of the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> institution, which is owned by <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Irvine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>. The bank board will own 30 percent of the institution and will receive 75 percent of the tax benefits arising from the transaction. Wall said <PERSON> Bass </PERSON> and negotiators for the bank board struck a deal late Friday and the board approved the agreement shortly after midnight on Saturday. He said the board decided to delay announcing it so the news would appear in newspapers on a business day. <PERSON> Wall </PERSON> said he expected the deal to be signed within `` a few days to a couple weeks'' after the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> approves the distribution of tax benefits in the transaction and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> officials approve a state charter for the reconstituted institution. <PERSON> Wall </PERSON> said regulators had agreed to provide cash assistance through the 10-year agreement, and that there was no upper limit on the assistance. He said $ 2 billion is the bank board's best estimate of its ultimate cost of the rescue after it sells its stake in the <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L, which <PERSON> Wall </PERSON> said should occur within less than five years, and reaps its share of the tax benefits. `` We gave some and they gave some. ... I do n't think we have given away the store by any means,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, with $ 30.2 billion in assets at the end of June, is the nation's second-largest thrift holding company, after Los Angeles-based <ORGANIZATION> H.F. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ahmanson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co. It has been S & amp; L regulators' biggest problem for four years. <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> first came under regulatory scrutiny in 1984 when it suffered a $ 6.8 billion run on deposits that sent shock waves through the industry. Another $ 490 million deposit run in the first two months of this year prompted regulators in March to promise to protect all of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION>'s depositors, even those with more than the $ 100,000 insurance limit. The old management resigned in August 1984 and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Popejoy </PERSON>, the current <ORGANIZATION> FCA </ORGANIZATION> chairman, was installed. But the company continued to lose money on its portfolio of soured loans, which had accumulated during <ORGANIZATION> FCA </ORGANIZATION>'s rapid expansion in 1983 and 1984. Most of it was secured by real estate in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and the economically-troubled oil country of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. In the first six months of this year, <ORGANIZATION> FCA </ORGANIZATION> reported losses of $ 223.7 million. Still, with enough federal assistance, American, <ORGANIZATION> FCA </ORGANIZATION>'s largest holding, has been considered a valuable purchase because of its broad access through 186 branches and 23 loan centers to the lucrative <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> market. The bank board, which regulates the nation's 3,000 <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls, had been negotiating exclusively since April 21, with the <ORGANIZATION> Bass </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, the investment arm of a member of a wealthy <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> family. The exclusive arrangement has drawn criticism from members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and executives of the San Francisco-based <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nationwide </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, a subsidiary of the <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. First Nationwide had unsuccessfully sought for nearly a year to acquire American before talks with regulators broke off The <ORGANIZATION> FCA </ORGANIZATION> rescue is the latest in a series of large transactions beginning in mid-August to clean up insolvent thrift associations. Since Aug. 18, the bank board has committed $ 12.2 billion in aid, including the <ORGANIZATION> FCA </ORGANIZATION> deal, to rescue 47 savings institutions: 21 in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, 14 in <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, five in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, two others in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and one each in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>. So far this year, the bank board has resolved the cases of 96 insolvent institutions, compared with 48 last year.

 Democratic vice presidential nominee <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> is stepping up his attacks on the Republicans while hammering home the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> theme that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy can do better and distribute the benefits more fairly. `` I think you'll see a more aggressive campaign,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> told reporters on Monday. He then went on to criticized Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as someone who gets his economic advice at `` Disneyland.'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> was visiting a job training program today in <LOCATION> Lawrenceville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, where people are taught to make computer circuit boards. He later planned to visit <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Polytechnic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Blacksburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, before returning this evening to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The visits appeared to be aimed directly at <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> positions _ <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential nominee <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s sponsorship of a jobs training bill and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s statement that he wanted to be `` the education president.'' Beginning his fall campaign on Labor Day in his native <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> attacked <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> as operating `` on autopilot'' when the nation needs to compete more aggressively in world markets. Echoing Democratic presidential nominee <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, he said ideology is not the issue. `` The Republicans like to talk about left and right. But this election is not about moving left or right,'' he said. `` It is about standing still with <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> or moving forward with <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, speaking to a partisan Democratic rally in <LOCATION> Beaumont </LOCATION>, ridiculed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s statement that the Republicans would create 30 million new jobs, noting there were only 6 million people out of work. `` I understand <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is out at <LOCATION> Disneyland </LOCATION> today. I think he's out there talking to his economist,'' he said. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> told reporters traveling with him that he expected to take <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and win the national election, but he acknowledged the Democrats were revising their tactics. `` You ca n't keep taking the kind of attacks that we saw,'' such as <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s repeated suggestions that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was unpatriotic. The <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> senator's events on Labor Day were boastfully patriotic. His speech in <LOCATION> Beaumont </LOCATION> was given standing before a huge American flag, and when he met <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for a picnic in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> later in the day, the thousands of spectators had been handed little flags. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s trip to <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> was his first campaign appearance in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> since he received the vice presidential nomination at the Democratic National Convention in July. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> had planned to visit <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> on his last campaign trip, but was forced to cancel when his campaign plane was grounded. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s spokesman, <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> McCurry </PERSON>, acknowledged that the Democrats were behind in the polls in both <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> but said with help from state Democratic officials they think there is a chance to reverse that by election day.

 A propane tank exploded Monday at a nudist camp, igniting a blaze that injured two people, forced 300 to flee and destroyed nine buildings and four vehicles, authorities said.

 <LOCATION> Libyan </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Moammar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> says his country and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> are moving in the same progressive direction and contends his ideas of socialist reform have influenced Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. In an interview Monday with <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> also challenged anyone to prove <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> accusations that he sponsors terrorism and said his relations with <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> may improve under <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> or <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. Asked about <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>'s relations with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, its chief arms supplier, <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> said: `` We are very close to each other, friends, we respect the policy of each other's side.'' `` Both of us are going in the same direction in the progression of socialism,'' <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> said, adding: `` I believe <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is affected by the Green Book.'' The Green Book is a collection of the colonel's philosophy on the `` revolution'' he has led in <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> since coming to power 19 years ago this month in a coup. <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> fielded questions in his office at the Bab el-Aziziya, or Heavenly Gate, military compound in <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION>. Soldiers were posted in watchtowers nearby and tanks were housed in camouflaged garages. The entire area was ringed by walls topped with rows of barbed-wire coils. The 46-year-old colonel _ dressed in a gold floor-length cape, green suede shirt and white slacks _ sat at a polished cherry desk, with glass and wood bookcases behind him. He said he would like to visit the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> `` if things were different'' and charaterized Americans who believe President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s charge that he sponsors terrorism are `` very simple people, ignorant people.'' `` I challenge everyone in the world to give evidence'' that <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> backs terrorism, he said, speaking English in the interview. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> accused <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> of sponsoring the December 1985 attacks that left 20 people dead at airports in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warplanes bombed <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> in April 1986 in an attack that killed 37 people, including <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON>'s 15-month-old adopted daughter. The raid was intended to punish <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> for its role in the April 5 bombing of a West German nightclub in which two <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> soldiers and a Turkish woman were killed. A July 11 terrorist attack that killed nine people on a Greek cruise ship was linked to <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON>, who is believed to travel frequently to <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>. `` Of course, we are against imperialism, racism and Zionism,'' said <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON>. `` We are not wrong, we are right to defend our interests. `` We are ready to improve our relations with <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> if the policy of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is changed. I expect this relation to improve.'' Earlier Monday, <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> was asked whether he preferred <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> nominee <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> or Democratic candidate <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` The one I would back would lose,'' <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> said laughing. Last spring, <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> told an American television news crew that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would be a `` better president because he has suffered with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and he would sort of make up for it.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> then said of the endorsement, `` I could have done without it. I'm going to ask him to reconsider.'' In conversations with foreigners, <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> has inquired about the background of both presidential candidates. <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> said on Monday he expects <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> foreign policy to change under the next administration, but did say how.

 With 25,000 firefighters in the West, the logistics of supplying all of them is staggering, say officials of the federal center established to do just that. As of Monday, the <ORGANIZATION> Boise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interagency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> has sent out 50,000 pairs of fire retardant gloves, 25,445 pairs of flame-proof trousers and nearly 32,000 paper sleeping bags. It also has distributed 41,607 canteens, 30,984 shirts, nearly 3,000 cans of foot powder, 15 pocket dictionaries, and for firefighters' internal blazes, 182 bottles of antacid. The center, established in 1965, is responsible for dispatching firefighters, aircraft and supplies to state and federal agencies throughout the country. More than 67,000 fires, burning a record of more than 3.6 million acres, have been reported in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> this year. The previous record was 3.2 million acres in 1985. `` This has been a very long fire season,'' said <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartigan </PERSON>, public affairs officer. `` It began early in June and now, almost three months later, it shows no signs of letting up.'' Labor Day was typical of the workload. While about 10 people might be on duty on a normal Labor Day, <PERSON> Hartigan </PERSON> said about 150 were working at center this year. The fire management center is made up of personnel from the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Land </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 The government says it arrested a 54-year-old Belgian air force colonel on suspicion of spying for an East European nation for profit, and that the suspect had confessed. Defense Minister Guy Coeme announced Monday that the suspect, Col. <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> Binet </PERSON>, had access to documents of the Belgian army and the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> and was believed to have started spying for a Soviet bloc country two years ago. He did not identify the country. `` At first sight it does not seem that the documents that he might have passed on are of a nature to destabilize the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> strategy or apparently have extremely important implications for the national defense,'' Coeme told reporters. He said <PERSON> Binet </PERSON> was arrested Saturday and had confessed. But he did not say what <PERSON> Binet </PERSON> had told investigators or where the suspect was being held. Coeme said it appeared that <PERSON> Binet </PERSON> was driven by profit rather than ideological reasons. `` He worked on his own and in direct contact with the foreign power,'' the minister said, and apparently received tens of thousands of dollars for the information he provided. A search of <PERSON> Binet </PERSON>'s house yielded material `` that certainly had to be used for espionage'' including a foreign-made suitcase with a secret compartment and special photographic material, Coeme said. `` We have a list of documents that were sought by the foreign power,'' he added. `` We do not know whether these documents have been provided but the documents concerned the Belgian army and <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> strategy.'' <PERSON> Binet </PERSON> was two years away from retirement. He was charged with treason and `` infractions against the external security of the state'' according to Coeme. If convicted <PERSON> Binet </PERSON> could be sentenced to life in prison. Coeme said <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> authorities had been informed of the arrest. <PERSON> Binet </PERSON> worked for the air force purchasing department and had access to files on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> F-16 jet fighter and contracts for the acquisition of helicopters for the Belgian army. Coeme said military authorities began investigating <PERSON> Binet </PERSON> a year ago after the colonel `` aroused suspicion.'' He did not elaborate. <PERSON> Binet </PERSON> was questioned Friday and arrested Saturday, the minister said. He said the case could lead to diplomatic problems between <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION> and the unidentified East European nation.

<HEAD>`Domino Effect' Seen Among Ailing Inner City Hospitals</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRENDA C. COLEMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Inner city hospitals collapsing in financial failure are likely to topple their ailing neighbors in a `` domino effect'' hastened by growing tides of poor and eroding government support, medical authorities say. Rural hospitals are shutting down at an equal rate and are leaving large gaps in the availability of health care, the authorities say. Last week, a 437-bed hospital in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and a 30-bed institution in rural southwestern <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> announced they would close, becoming casualties in an accelerating national trend. `` It's a fragile environment for hospitals,'' says <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Shulman </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which tallied a record 79 hospital closings nationwide last year. In <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, for example, five closed in 1987. Twenty-five of the state's 226 remaining hospitals fit the profile of endangered institutions, most in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and one in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. Typically, the shaky hospitals are in poor, inner-city neighborhoods, with 25 percent of their patients poor people covered under Medicaid, 30 percent to 40 percent elderly people covered under <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION>, and 5 percent to 10 percent indigent people with no way of paying, <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON> said. The state pays hospitals only 73 cents for every dollar they spend treating Medicaid patients, and the federal government pays only 90 cents for every dollar spent treating <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> patients, he said. `` Nearly 60 percent of all community hospitals lost money providing patient-care services in 1986,'' Ms. <PERSON> Shulman </PERSON> said. She noted that the number of uninsured people has risen from 33 million in 1983 to 37 million. `` There's a certain domino effect that accompanies the closing of any hospital,'' <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON> said. If a neighboring hospital has been treating many poor patients, `` and it has to absorb even more, the additional load could be the straw that breaks the back of that hospital.'' <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON>, outgoing director of the <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aid </ORGANIZATION>, says surplus beds as much as inadequate government support are to blame for much of the trouble. He cited the soon-to-be closed <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Anne </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> as an example, noting that it has been using only about one-quarter of its 437 beds. `` Hospitals like <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Anne </PERSON>'s are the steel mills of the hospital industry,'' <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON> said after the hospital announced its closing last week. `` People do n't use hospitals like they used to. I could have tripled my rates -LRB- of Medicaid reimbursement -RRB- but that would not have kept that hospital open.'' `` I totally disagree,'' said <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON>, adding that <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Anne </PERSON>'s scaled back on beds as an appropriate response to falling demand `` In the final analysis, it was inadequate payment that killed them, not just ... this year or last year, but over a period of years.'' Inner city hospitals are not alone in these difficulties. <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, whose 43 hospital closings since the beginning of 1987 are the most for any state during the period, sees most of the shutdowns among tiny rural hospitals, said <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. Besides inadequate government reimbursement and falling occupancy rates, rural hospitals have trouble attracting qualified doctors and nurses, she said in a telephone interview last week from <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> has 48 counties with no hospital, Mrs. <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> said, noting that residents of such counties must travel to seek health care. `` If it's a non-emergency situation that may be OK, but if it's a life-threatening situation, that might be too far,'' she said <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON> said solutions to the problem will come only through more adequate Medicaid and Medicare financing; better incentives for physicians to treat poor patients in their offices, relieving the burden of indigent patients on hospitals; and better provision of nursing home care. That will require more activism than in the past, according to <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Bird </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Healthcare </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, an organization of 96 hospitals. `` Individuals and agencies that represent the poor and elderly have got to tell their legislators that we ca n't afford any more underfinancing,'' he said. `` And the legislators have got to respond, or there are going to be more closures.''

 Paramilitary police, some carrying truncheons, broke up a demonstration and arrested protesters marking the 70th anniversary of the launching of a Bolshevik campaign to stifle political opposition. At least 100 police officers, occasionally aided by civilian auxiliary police, also detained some pedestrians who shouted that the arrests were `` a disgrace.'' Monday's demonstration was on the 70th anniversary of the `` Red Terror,'' the Bolshevik campaign that decreed `` class enemies'' should be put in concentration camps and political opponents shot. The demonstration in downtown Pushkin Square was called by the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, an unofficial political group. Reporters saw five people arrested and put into buses. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>, the official news agency, said 17 members of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> were detained and a court would decide punishment. <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Mityunov </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, said none of the members had been in touch with him by late Monday, and interpreted that to mean they still were in jail. During the demonstration, police hauled away an elderly woman and arrested a man after he put a black ribbon over his mouth, apparently to symbolize that authorities prevented freedom of speech. It was not clear whether the man or the woman belonged to the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>. More than 100 people gathered around the woman as she spoke of being jailed and sent to internal exile years ago. When a police officer yelled `` Disperse!'' a column of about 50 policemen forced the crowd aside and grabbed the woman. The <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> called the demonstration to remember the `` Red Terror,'' which began with the Sept. 5, 1918 decree against opponents. That started government repression of political dissidents, the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement, and serves to show that only a multiparty system and pluralistic economy can safeguard human rights. On Aug. 21, the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> tried to demonstrate in <LOCATION> Pushkin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> against the Soviet-led invasion of Czechsolovakia 20 years earlier. Police broke up the rally, arresting more than 100 people. Protesters said later they were beaten at the police station. A dozen police officers carried rubber truncheons Monday but did not appear to use them on demonstrators. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said the program the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> calls the `` Red Terror'' was necessary and all revolutionary regimes use such measures to protect themselves from `` external and internal enemies.''

 A summer marred by fouled beaches, drought and sweltering heat came to its unofficial Labor Day finale with frustrated beachgoers demonstrating against pollution, and a nip in the air over much of the nation. Millions of Americans attended parades, foods fests and political rallies Monday. And though labor seems to have little to do with Labor Day 106 years after the holiday's inauguration, some people were even on the job. In <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, a third day of sizzling heat over 100 degrees drove an estimated 1 million people to beaches. `` It's pretty much a towel-to-towel beach gridlock out there by the water,'' said <LOCATION> Malibu </LOCATION> lifeguard <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Barker </PERSON>, estimating that more than 200,000 sunbathers hit the beach. But east of the upper <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, afternoon temperatures remained below 70 degrees. The city-owned Wave Pool in <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, drew only about 30 people as the temperature rose to the high 60s. The normal Labor Day crowd is 1,000. As night fell, frost advisories were issued in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>. A human chain of about 1,000 people stretched across two <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, beaches, singing `` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> the Beautiful'' and calling for an end to ocean dumping. Medical waste and other debris has washed ashore this summer from the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lakes </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, ruining vacations for hundreds of thousands of people. Others spent Labor Day laboring. But they did n't seem to mind. `` I feel working on Labor Day is appropriate,'' said <PERSON> Pam </PERSON> <PERSON> Pettegrew </PERSON>, a receptionist at the <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> Hotel. In <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>, Archbishop <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Borders </PERSON> honored workers with the Blessing of the Tools at the Cathedral of Mary Our Queen. Rank-and-file members of unions placed the tools of their trades at the altar. In the West, forest fires interfered with Labor Day traditions for some outdoorsmen. <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> _ full of smoke _ closed roads and campgrounds, some public forests closed, and the governors of <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> asked people to voluntarily stay out of the tinder-dry woods. Thousands swarmed to the third annual Railroad Days celebration at <LOCATION> Topeka </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION>, an observance of the role the <ORGANIZATION> Santa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> played in the city's history. Tickets were sold out weeks for rides on a 1940s vintage train. <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, held its fourth-annual Bread and Roses Heritage Day Festival. The celebration, marked by a parade and concerts by folk singer <PERSON> Odetta </PERSON> and others, commemorates the Great Strike of 1912 against textile mills, also known as the Bread and Roses Strike. Labor Day's role as the traditional end to the summer season was seen in <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, where southbound traffic reached more than 3,400 vehicles an hour on the <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Turnpike </LOCATION> as vacationers left the state. Entertainer <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> conducted his annual telethon drive for the <ORGANIZATION> Muscular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dystrophy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, raising a record $ 41,132,113. <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> marked Labor Day with a 12-hour sampling festival with food from 40 restaurants and a downtown celebration that included live music and entertainment, with proceeds donated to <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>' telethon On <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Side </ORGANIZATION>, thousands gathered at the Taste of <LOCATION> Polonia </LOCATION> festival to eat sausage, play bingo and listen to polka bands and an Elvis impersonator. The weekendlong Rock ` A' Rama in downtown <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> celebrated the fads, music and food of the 1950s. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, <PERSON> Chubby </PERSON> <PERSON> Checker </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Perkins </PERSON>, the Shangri-Las and others were on the weekend's entertainment schedule.

Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> addressed a rally that followed <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>'s three-hour Labor Day parade, and Republican <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> addressed people who had gathered for the Polish Day parade at <LOCATION> Hamtramck </LOCATION>, a Polish enclave in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> stumped in vote-rich southern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>94-Year-Old Former Teamsters President Sees Stronger Days For
Labor</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Labor Day Rdp</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 With 94 Labor Days under his belt, former <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Beck </PERSON> sees stronger days ahead for organized labor. `` Labor is strictly a business,'' <PERSON> Beck </PERSON> said. `` All I ever did in the labor union movement was sell labor for the best price I could get. And that's the only ... thing labor's got to sell, is labor.'' Although statistics indicate the percentage of unionized workers in the labor force is declining, <PERSON> Beck </PERSON> is n't worried. `` We're doing just fine,'' he said last week at his home in suburban <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Forest </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>. `` Now, you take all these mergers. Sure, every time there's a merger it does cut 200 or 300 jobs. But let it reverse _ and it will _ and we'll reverse it -LRB- union representation -RRB-, too.'' <PERSON> Beck </PERSON>'s own success was due as much to his own business deals as his rise to the top of organized labor. He quit school in his early teens to support his family by driving a laundry truck in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, and became a multimillionaire from real-estate investments. Some of his activities led to trouble. He spent 2 -LCB- years on <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> charges at <LOCATION> McNeil </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> when it was a federal penitentiary, and paid $ 1.3 million in back taxes and penalties. <PERSON> Beck </PERSON> is largely unconcerned with that history. But he does recall his days as reigning power in the <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> union, when presidents <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> Delano </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON>, <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dwight </PERSON> <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON> asked him to join their cabinets as secretary of labor. He turned all down. `` <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON> said, ` You ca n't say no to the president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,''' recalled <PERSON> Beck </PERSON>. `` I said ` I not only can, I am.''' <PERSON> Beck </PERSON> also oversaw the <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION>' withdrawal from the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> when the <ORGANIZATION> AFL </ORGANIZATION> merged with the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industrial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organizations </ORGANIZATION>. `` The greatest mistake -LRB- former <ORGANIZATION> AFL </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Meany </PERSON> -RRB- ever made was throwing the <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> out, because the <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> did n't need the <ORGANIZATION> AFL </ORGANIZATION> but the <ORGANIZATION> AFL </ORGANIZATION> sure needed the Teamsters,'' <PERSON> Beck </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Beck </PERSON> also has observations about the current scene, including the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s recent civil lawsuit seeking to vacate <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> union leadership to rid it of alleged corruption. It `` was definitely politics _ and bad politics'' that will never reach trial, he predicted. `` How <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> could do that to us I'll never understand,'' he said. `` I sat at the same table with him in our <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> days'' when <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was Screen Actors Guild president. There is no mob influence in today's unions, <PERSON> Beck </PERSON> said, and if there is union racketeering going on, `` not one ounce of it goes on west of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>.'' `` I'm not here to say somewhere along the line you're not gon na find some evidence -LRB- of illegality -RRB-, but you can go right over to Wall Street and find people who stole hundreds of millions of dollars,'' he said. As for <PERSON> Beck </PERSON> himself, he said he hopes to see his 100th Labor Day, `` and I plan to.'' `` But,'' he added, `` I do n't know that I'd bank on it.''

<HEAD>Journalists Strike to Protest Defamation Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RAJU GOPALAKRISHNAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Thousands of journalists across <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> went on strike today to protest a proposed new defamation law they say aims to curtail press freedom. All but one of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>'s 17 dailies carried front-page notices announcing they would not publish Wednesday. The two national news agencies, the <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION>, stopped working at 3 a.m. and said they would resume after the 24-hour strike. The proposed Defamation Act expands the concept of defamation and negates the presumption of innocence of journalists or others making disclosures. Newspapers branded it `` draconian,'' `` fascist,'' and `` undemocratic.'' The legislation would allow punishment of up to two years in prison for first offenders and up to five years for subsequent convictions. It shifts the burden of proof from plaintiff to journalists and calls for speedy trials _ something not stipulated for murder, treason or rape trials. Professional organizations and the political opposition called the bill censorship in disguise, an attempt by Prime Minister <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> to muzzle the press following reports that top government officials accepted millions of dollars in kickbacks from defense purchases. `` The suspension of publication is an extreme step,'' the anti-government <ORGANIZATION> Indian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> said in an editorial. But it said the strike `` is bound to be just one in a long struggle against a cabal which has lost its head.'' Even the normally pro-government <ORGANIZATION> Hindustan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> newspaper said it supported the strike. `` It will be honorable for the government to admit its mistake and rectify it,'' it said in an editorial. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> said he was `` fully convinced'' of the need for the bill. The Lok Sabha, the lower house of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, approved the Defamation Act on Aug. 30. The Rajya Sabha, the upper house, was supposed to take up the bill Monday, but <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> delayed consideration and appointed a committee of seven Cabinet ministers to discuss the matter with journalists. The bill must be passed by both houses and then signed by President <PERSON> Ramaswamy </PERSON> <PERSON> Venkataraman </PERSON> before becoming law. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s move to delay consideration on the bill `` does not does not fully meet the purport of the objections to and the grave apprehensions about this draconian bill,'' said the leftist Patriot newspaper. But the pro-government <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION>, the only <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION> newspaper which worked today, said: `` The government has shown it has an open mind and that it does not stand on prestige. It is now for all of us to display a constructive approach so that the measure is discussed ... without any kind of acrimony.''

 Comedian <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> says his 23rd-annual Labor Day telethon was `` the wildest ride of emotions I've ever gone through'' as he raised a record $ 41,132,113 in the 21 -LCB- - hour nationally broadcast program <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> had vowed to tug at the hearts of the 120 million viewers, and did so with a parade of celebrities and poignant stories from muscular dystrophy victims and their families. `` This is the wildest roller coaster I've ever been on, the wildest ride of emotions I've ever gone through,'' <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> said as the tote board surpassed last year's record of $ 39,021,723. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> has been involved with the New York-based <ORGANIZATION> Muscular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dystrophy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> for 39 years, beginning his annual Labor Day telethons in 1966. The show featured appearances by corporate sponsors who contributed $ 34,379,537, which was not included in the telethon's final tote Because of the longevity and the money raised to date _ $ 484,314,483 _ the annual Labor Day event has become known as `` the'' telethon. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> saved some of the most touching moments for the final hours of the show, including a farewell to <PERSON> Mikey </PERSON> <PERSON> Neufeldt </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> MDA </ORGANIZATION> poster child the past two years. Researchers chronicled the progress that had been made during the past year in fighting muscular dystrophy, a chronic, non-contagious disease characterized by a progressive wasting of the muscles. And celebrities such as Ann-Margret and her husband, <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, appealed for help in fighting diseases that have touched their lives. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> suffers from myasthenia gravis, a sometimes fatal muscle disease that is among the 40 targeted by the <ORGANIZATION> MDA </ORGANIZATION>. `` It is difficult to sit by and wait and hope'' while cures are sought, his wife said. The show also featured a segment on <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON>, who died in June of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, known as <PERSON> Lou </PERSON> <PERSON> Gehrig </PERSON>'s disease. Two of Day's 10 children were featured on a tape with their father as he talked of his hope of beating the disease. `` I could see it in his eyes,'' said son <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> McNulty </PERSON>. `` He was afraid. I was afraid, too, afraid of losing him.'' The telethon also featured some of the victims of muscular dystrophy. <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> DeStefano </PERSON> wept as they talked of the death of their 6 -LCB- - month-old girl from muscular dystrophy <PERSON> DeStefano </PERSON> said his daughter, weakened by the disease, did n't have the strength to smile at him until the couple left her hospital bed for the last time. `` I turned and she gave me this huge smile,'' <PERSON> DeStefano </PERSON> said, weeping. `` That was <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON>'s way of saying goodbye to me.''

<DATELINE>MBABANE, Swaziland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Ruled by the world's youngest monarch, tiny <LOCATION> Swaziland </LOCATION> marked 20 years of independence today as a nation rich in tradition and largely free of the turbulence that plagues its neighbors. Wedged between <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>, this kingdom of rolling hills and lush valleys has spent the past two decades pursuing both Western-style modernization and preservation of age-old customs. Progress means a new <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION> bottling plant in the capital of <LOCATION> Mbabane </LOCATION>, video cassette recorders in the expanding shops and luxury tourist hotels. Tradition, meanwhile, calls for regular celebrations with singing and dancing by bare-breasted maidens in tribute to 20-year-old spear-wielding King <PERSON> Mswati </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> and his mother, known as the Great She Elephant. For these festive occasions, including a nine-hour independence celebration planned today at the country's main stadium, both men and women appear in traditional red, orange and yellow skirts, with long strands of beads and feathers in their hair. The men carry animal skin shields, the women wear beehive hairnets. The baby-faced king, who already has four wives, was barely four months old when his nation received independence from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> on Sept. 6, 1968. Two years ago, he replaced his father, the late <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Sobhuza </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, who ruled for 62 years and had at least 68 sons. Economically, landlocked <LOCATION> Swaziland </LOCATION> remains an agricultural nation heavily dependent on <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, which borders it on three sides. Thousands of Swazi men work in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s mines and the vast majority of <LOCATION> Swaziland </LOCATION>'s imports reach the country via its powerful neighbor. A handful of foreign firms that disinvested from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> _ such as <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION> _ have moved their plants to <LOCATION> Swaziland </LOCATION>. Another approach has been for firms in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> to falsely label their goods as `` Made in <LOCATION> Swaziland </LOCATION>'' to evade embargoes against <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> has received `` Made in <LOCATION> Swaziland </LOCATION>'' wine, even though there are no vineyards in <LOCATION> Swaziland </LOCATION>. Citrus produce amounting to four times <LOCATION> Swaziland </LOCATION>'s annual output has turned up with Swazi labels in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Swaziland </LOCATION>'s eastern neighbor, <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>, offers access to the <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> and alternatives to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> transport routes. But <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>'s main contribution at present is an unwelcome one _ more than 100,000 refugees who have fled into <LOCATION> Swaziland </LOCATION> from famine and civil war in their country. <LOCATION> Swaziland </LOCATION>, half the size of <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, has two refugee centers designed to hold just a few thousand people. Aside from the refugees, who swell the country's population by about 15 percent, <LOCATION> Swaziland </LOCATION> is ethnically homogenous and has avoided the inter-tribal strife that has plagued many other African countries. The relatively few indidents of political violence in recent years generally have involved anti-apartheid activists and guerrillas from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, who on occasion have been targets of cross-border raids and kidnappings by South African agents. The king and the royal family have the final say on all major matters. But most day-to-day business is left in the hands of the Cabinet, <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> and the bureaucracy, which conduct the political affairs with a distinctive <LOCATION> Swazi </LOCATION> touch. When the parliamentary electoral college was selected last November, members were chosen by voters who passed through cattle gates next to the candidate of their choice. When retired white farmer <PERSON> Rex </PERSON> <PERSON> Baxter </PERSON> and his wife arrived to vote, policemen grabbed him, placed him at a gate and told him he had been chosen as a candidate. While being whisked away for week-long private consultations with the other winners, <PERSON> Baxter </PERSON> shouted to his wife to bring his heart tablets and cigarettes from home.

<HEAD>Prime Minister Signs Historic Pact To Give Indians Arctic Tract</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: Dollar figures U.S.</NOTE>
<TEXT>
 RAE-EDZO, <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Territories </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ Two native groups in the Arctic will become the largest non-government landholders in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> under a historic agreement signed by Prime Minister <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON>. The long-delayed agreement, signed in this tiny community 200 miles south of the <LOCATION> Arctic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Circle </LOCATION> on the shores of <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Slave </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION>, will give the Denes and Metis Indian nations nearly 4,000 square miles of land and special rights to an area the size of <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> said the signing marked a `` day of justice'' and heralds `` new economic and political development'' for the north. But native leaders say many specifics must be negotiated before a final pact is signed in two years. Monday's agreement gives about 15,000 natives of the Dene and Metis Indian nations ownership and oil and mineral rights to about 3,850 square miles of the rocky bush land bordering the <LOCATION> Arctic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION>. It would also give them special rights and interests _ including a voice in wildlife, forestry and land management _ for a nearly 70,000 square miles area. The agreement, which followed 15 years of negotiations, includes a $ 405 million cash settlement that would be paid out over 20 years beginning in 1990 _ the year negotiators hope to have a final settlement. `` This agreement of principle, when carried forward to its final form, will establish a new, stronger and healthier relationship between the people of this area and the governments which serve them,'' said <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON>, who was welcomed with the beat of drums and a ceremonial prayer chant. He added that the agreement marks `` real progress'' in the Dene quest for self-determination. But the chief of the Dene nation warned that <LOCATION> Ottawa </LOCATION> and native leaders must still negotiate issues such as aboriginal title and self-government. `` We will be seeking changes before we reach the final agreement,'' <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Erasmus </PERSON> told about 1,000 <ORGANIZATION> Dogrib </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION> on the steps of the village's Roman Catholic church. The Dogribs are the largest of seven groups making up the Dene nation. <LOCATION> Ottawa </LOCATION> said the Dene handed over their aboriginal rights when they signed 1899 and 1921 treaties. But the Dene contend they never gave up their aboriginal rights and, under Monday's agreement, are handing over some of their land in return for financial compensation and the guarantee of hunting and fishing rights. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Paulette </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Territories </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Metis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said he was sure `` we can now negotiate a satisfactory deal within the next two years.'' <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON>'s visit to Rae-Edzo, 65 miles northwest of the territorial capital of <LOCATION> Yellowknife </LOCATION>, marked his first trip to the <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Territories </LOCATION> since his Conservatives gained power four years ago.

The dollar closed lower at 135.60 yen, down 0.43 yen, following Monday's loss of 0.72 yen.

`Domestic adoption ...'</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By PAUL SHIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 To avoid possible controversy during the Olympics, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> has temporarily halted foreign adoption of its babies. The government has not officially confirmed the ban, but adoption agencies acknowledged they were asked to stop sending babies overseas for adoption for two months before and during the Olympics, which run from Sept. 17 to Oct. 2. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> sends about 7,000 children abroad annually for adoption in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Adoption officials say <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> is one of the easiest nations for overseas adoptions. `` We are getting a lot of complaints from foreign adoptive parents, but we have to follow the government order,'' said one senior official at a <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> adoption agency, speaking on condition of anonymity. He said his agency alone would not be able to send 200 babies for adoption in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> during the two-month period. Baby adoption is an embarrassing issue for <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, with critics saying that now that the nation has achieved prosperity it should care for its orphans and other unwanted children. Overseas baby adoption began when <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> was poor, its economy devastated by the Korean War of 1950-53, and the government encouraged the practice to help alleviate the country's social and economic problems. Some unofficial estimates indicate that about 14,000 South Korean babies are adopted at home and abroad each year. They are given up for adoption by unwed mothers or abandoned by their parents. Government officials refused to give out any figures or grant interviews, but many social workers agree that <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> probably was the largest supplier of babies for adoption in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1987. Social workers estimated that about half of the 12,000 foreign babies adopted in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> last year came from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. Domestic adoption continues to be a problem, because most Koreans value blood ties and do not want to take in unrelated children. There are signs, however, that the problem could ease in several years because the number of babies given up for adoption or abandoned continues to decrease, social workers say. The changing trend is extending the waiting period for foreign adoptions of Korean children from about 1 -LCB- years to 2 -LCB- years, they said. About 80 percent of the babies given up for adoption are born to unwed mothers and, social workers said, the government's active birth control and other programs are helping reduce the number of babies born out of wedlock. In Confucian-oriented Korean society, babies born out of wedlock tend to be despised and considered castaways. Foreign adoptive parents now pay $ 4,000 in adoption fees that include care costs, transporation and adoption processing expenses.

 Three hundred people left their clothes behind as they fled a nudist camp when a propane gas tank exploded, igniting a fire that injured two people and damaged several buildings, authorities said. Residents of the Tree House Fun Ranch were nude when the fire broke out Monday afternoon, said <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bernardino </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Fire dispatcher <PERSON> Martha </PERSON> <PERSON> Pfrommer </PERSON>. One naked woman flagged down a fire truck and directed it to the blaze. `` It gave them pause at first,'' Ms. <PERSON> Pfrommer </PERSON> said of the firefighters who answered the call. `` They have n't been to a fire like that in recent memory.'' About 150 of those who fled were permanent residents of the 53-acre ranch, located in this rural area about 50 east of downtown <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>; the other 150 were Labor Day visitors, she said. <PERSON> Rocco </PERSON> <PERSON> Lollo </PERSON>, whose age was not available, suffered burns over 50 percent of his body and was treated at a hospital, said fire department spokeswoman <PERSON> Lesley </PERSON> <PERSON> Dale </PERSON>. An unidentified woman suffered minor injuries, Ms. <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> said. The fire started in some brush and spread to three acres before it was contained in about 1 -LCB- hours, fire officials said. Two homes were destroyed and three were damaged. Seven outside structures were destroyed as were four vehicles. Damage was estimated at $ 250,000, said Ms. <PERSON> Dale </PERSON>. The cause of the explosion was under investigation, but arson was ruled out, she added. People were allowed to return to the camp by 10 p.m. Repeated attempts to contact the camp by phone were unsuccessful. A Pacific Bell operator said the phone appeared to have been taken off the hook.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Musavi </PERSON> submitted his resignation after seven years as <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s prime minister, but President <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON> rejected it today, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> reported. <PERSON> Musavi </PERSON> had tendered his resignation Monday, saying in a letter to <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON> that he wanted to step down primarily because he believed as many as eight of his <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION>'s 21 members would fail to win a vote of confidence in the <ORGANIZATION> Majlis </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s 270-seat parliament, the agency said. It was not immediately clear whether <PERSON> Musavi </PERSON> would accept <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON>'s action. <PERSON> Musavi </PERSON> had indicated in the letter printed today in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Jomhuri </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eslami </ORGANIZATION> newspaper that he would remain as a caretaker premier until a successor was named, <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> reported The agency, monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, quoted <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON>'s office as saying the president turned down the premier's resignation in a letter to <PERSON> Musavi </PERSON>. The Majlis had been scheduled to vote on <PERSON> Musavi </PERSON>'s Cabinet today but called off the session after the announced resignation, which took foreign observers by surprise. <PERSON> Musavi </PERSON>, a 46-year-old radical, has sought major economic reforms in the face of bitter opposition from conservative clerics. In his letter, <PERSON> Musavi </PERSON> apparently did not explain why he believed the <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> members would not win the confidence vote, but did say his administration would not be able to function with eight vacant Cabinet posts. He did not identify the Cabinet members, who have been at their posts since <PERSON> Musavi </PERSON> carried out minor shuffles following two-stage parliamentary elections in April and May. <PERSON> Musavi </PERSON>'s appeared to have strengthened his hand in the balloting, with radicals who seek sweeping reforms making major gains. <PERSON> Musavi </PERSON>'s Cabinet includes Foreign Minister <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Akbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON>, who heads <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s delegation to the U.N.-sponsored peace talks in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> aimed at ending the 8-year-old war with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> ended years of playing off one faction against the other earlier this year by openly supporting the Musavi-led radicals and their campaign for economic reform. Amid persistent reports that <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>, 88, is ailing, a power struggle between rival factions in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> to fill the vacuum when the aging patriarch dies has intensified in recent months. <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s unexpected decision last month to unconditionally accept a U.N.-sponsored cease-fire in the gulf war, after a string of military defeats, also sharpened divisions that have plagued <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>. The bearded <PERSON> Musavi </PERSON>, a militant fundamentalist who trained as an engineer and architect at <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Melli </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, was named prime minister in October 1981. <PERSON> Musavi </PERSON> has been criticized by conservative factions, who favor private enterprise, for his handling of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s war-battered economy. He favors wider state control of the economy and a major redistribution of land _ much of it still held by the merchants and religious groups _ and the nation's wealth to help the poor. Before being named prime minister, <PERSON> Musavi </PERSON> had been foreign minister and a member of the central council of the governing <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> disbanded last year. He was one of the few laymen in the initial post-revolution period to take high office in the theocratic <LOCATION> Islamic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Musavi </PERSON> began his revolutionary career as a clerk for <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Beheshti </PERSON>, secretary-general of the <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and one of the key revolutionary figures. <PERSON> Beheshti </PERSON> was killed with other senior political leaders in June 1981 when leftist opponents bombed the party headquarters.

<TEXT>
 Foreign Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> kicked off the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s election campaign by calling on Palestinians to end their uprising and start a peace dialogue with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> also vowed to return occupied territory in exchange for peace, saying such a move would assure a stronger <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> with a clear Jewish majority. `` We shall rid ourselves of <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>, we shall rid ourselves of areas densely populated by Arabs,'' <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> told a crowd of 3,000 supporters Monday night in a concert hall. <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> called on Palestinians in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> to end their 9-month-old rebellion and negotiate with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. `` We do not wish to oppress them, humiliate them or deport them. The road is open before them, instead of fighting, there can be dialogue,'' <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> said. `` The Palestinians will come -LRB- to negotiate -RRB- because a military option does not exist for them and they still do not have a political option of their own,'' <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> added and was wildly applauded. The Palestinian revolt is the major campaign issue in the Nov. 1 elections, billed as the most crucial in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s 40-year history. At least 258 Palestinians and four Israelis have died in the unrest, which began Dec. 8. In its new platform, the left-leaning <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> calls for the first time for direct talks with Palestinians and `` leaves the door open for'' dialogue with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> aide <PERSON> Yossi </PERSON> <PERSON> Beilin </PERSON>. Labor `` will be willing to hold a dialogue with <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> people or agents who recognize <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, oppose terror,'' and accept two <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> resolutions which implicitly recognize the Jewish state, the platform says. The <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> is now banned in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> as a terrorist organization. Labor's platform supports relinqushing parts of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> for peace. The territories are home to about 1.5 million Palestinians and about 60,000 Jewish settlers. However, <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> made it clear that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> would not yield all the land captured in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. `` Defensible borders can not be the pre-1967 borders,'' <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> told the rally. `` We will not return to those lines, not even for peace.'' Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s rival <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bloc </ORGANIZATION> objects to relinquishing territory to the Arabs and to talks with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. But it favors a peace dialogue with other Palestinians on the basis of the 1978 U.S.-brokered Camp David Accord, which preceded <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s 1979 peace treaty with <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> The Camp David Agreement calls for five years of <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> self-rule in the occupied territories as an interim solution. On July 31, King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> announced he was cutting administrative ties with the occupied lands and yielding responsibility for their affairs to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> said he still believed a peace settlement with <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> is possible. `` We shall invite <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and we shall invite the Palestinians,'' to peace talks, he said. `` The Jordanians will come because when we talk peace, <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> will not turn away.'' Speaker after speaker attacked the <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION>, setting the stage for what promises to be a vitriolic election campaign. `` We have 55 days -LRB- until election day -RRB- to confront the coalition of annexationists, a right wing which has become more extreme,'' said <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>. `` It is a coalition based on fear, a coalition which spreads fear of peace.'' While party leaders raised their arms, clenched their fists and promised victory, many spectators appeared doubtful. Recent public opinion polls indicate that the rightist parties led by the <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> have a slight edge over the liberal coalition headed by Labor. <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> and Labor have maintained a tenuous coalition since 1984 because neither party won a majority that year in the 120-seat <ORGANIZATION> Knesset </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s parliament.

 The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> trailed one its 10 most wanted fugitives from <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> before arresting him there for the 1987 slaying of a policeman. <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Otsuki </PERSON>, 36, was being extradited to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> late Monday after a yearlong search that culminated in his arrest Sunday in <LOCATION> Guadalajara </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, authorities said. `` <PERSON> Otsuki </PERSON> is a very very violent and dangerous fugitive,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahearn </PERSON>, special agent in charge of the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> bureau. `` I characterized him ... as one of the most dangerous I had ever encountered.'' <PERSON> Otsuki </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Harlingen </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, native, was on parole after serving a prison sentence for robbing a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> bank when he allegedly shot detective <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON>, 42, and rookie officer <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Torres </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> Special Agent <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallagher </PERSON>. On Oct. 2, 1987, the two <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> police officers had stopped a suspect after they spotted him trying to climb a fence behind a building While <PERSON> Otsuki </PERSON> was being taken into custody, police say, he reached inside his pocket and fired a 9mm pistol through his coat, striking <PERSON> Torres </PERSON> in the chest and left arm. The suspect fled through an alley where he was confronted by <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> and his partner. He fired again, striking <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> in the chest, buttocks and right arm. <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> police obtained a murder warrant for <PERSON> Otsuki </PERSON> after <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON>, who was recovering from his wounds, died of a heart attack Oct. 26. An autopsy concluded that <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON>'s heart attack resulted from an embolism directly related to his wounds. <PERSON> Torres </PERSON>, 21 at the time of the shooting, recovered from his wounds. During the search, investigators traced <PERSON> Otsuki </PERSON> to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, where police discovered two pipe bombs in a downtown storage area that <PERSON> Otsuki </PERSON> was renting, authorities said. The bombs were dismantled and no one was injured. Besides the police killing, <PERSON> Otsuki </PERSON> faces charges of unlawful possession of explosives, felonious posession of a firearm, interstate flight to avoid prosecution and parole violations, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> said.

<HEAD>Amnesty: Human Rights Improved In Cuba, But Critics Still Jailed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The communist leaders of <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> continue to imprison citizens who speak out against them, but have also taken significant steps toward improving human rights, <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> says in a report today. <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s recent release of large numbers of political prisoners, improvement of prison conditions and limiting of the scope of the death penalty were welcomed by the international human rights organization. However, laws that have been used to stifle opposition and jail `` prisoners of conscience'' remain in force and seriously threaten government critics, it said. The report was written after a three-member team led by Amnesty Secretary-General <PERSON> Ian </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> visited <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> in March for the first time since 1977. The group repeated its longstanding appeal to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> for the unconditional release of prisoners of conscience, people jailed for their political or religious beliefs. Many recently released prisoners have been forced to leave <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, it said. Most political prisoners were charged with `` enemy propaganda'' after writing or saying things the government disapproved of, sometimes in private letters sent abroad or to foreign embassies in <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Amnesty </PERSON> said. It said others were convicted of trying to leave <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> without permission or of insulting behavior toward state officials. The group believes others were sentenced for politically related criminal offenses `` where there is reason to believe that they may have been convicted solely on account of their peaceful opposition to the <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> government,'' the report said. Amnesty urged the <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION> government to speed up a promised review of hundreds of political prisoners and expressed concern about their ability to obtain a proper defense and trial. It said the `` steady pace'' of recent releases of political prisoners made it difficult to estimate how many are still held in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. As of early August, about 250 prisoners were being held for crimes against state security and an unknown number _ believed to be in the hundreds _ were held under other sections of <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s penal code used to restrict basic rights, particularly the internationally recognized right to leave one's country, <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> said. The Amnesty team met senior <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> security and legal officials, visited two prisons holding political prisoners and interviewed dozens of prisoners in private, the report said. It said political inmates in the two prisons, <ORGANIZATION> Combinado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> del </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Este </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Boniato </PERSON>, were in the past reported to have been beaten, kept in poor conditions, given inadequate food and denied medical treatment. It said Cuban authorities told the visitors they were trying to improve the worst parts of these prisons. The report noted that improvements in physical conditions and the prison regime appear to have been introduced in the last eight months. However, <PERSON> Amnesty </PERSON> said prisoners do not feel confident of getting a fair hearing about complaints and fear retaliation. Amnesty said use of the death penalty appears to have been reduced considerably since the early 1980s. It quoted <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s justice minister as saying that although 216 people were executed between 1959 and 1987, the number executed since 1984 is 11, all for common crimes rather than security crimes.

 Residents near Golden Gate Park oppose open-air soup kitchens near their homes, a neighborhood leader said, after the arrest of 50 people who clashed with police while trying to pass out food and pamphlets. No injuries were reported in Monday's fracas. On Aug. 29, 29 people were arrested in a similar confrontation, and leaders of the group called <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Not </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bombs </ORGANIZATION> said they would return each Monday. <PERSON> Lorraine </PERSON> <PERSON> Rorke </PERSON>, vice president of one of several neighborhood organizations opposed to the giveaways by the group, said residents believe it is `` not so interested in giving away food as they are in promoting their particular message.'' Food and fists flew Monday when police in riot gear closed in on about 200 people gathered for the giveaway. The scene was next to <LOCATION> Haight-Ashbury </LOCATION>, home of the flower power movement in the'60s, but more recently a transitional neighborhood where restored Victorian homes fetch hundreds of thousands of dollars. Food Not Bombs members have a right to their political views, <PERSON> Rorke </PERSON> said. `` I just do n't like their means of using the hungry and blocking the entrance to the park,'' she said. She added that it is difficult to reach a playground at the park without passing through a crowd of `` left-over hippies and burnt-out druggies.'' Police spokesman Sgt. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Senkir </PERSON> said the action would not have been against the law had the group obtained permits. As the officers approached, food began to fly through the air, with one officer being hit in the face with a plate of rice and one being struck in the neck with a tomato. Those arrested faced possible misdemeanor charges, and one woman faced a charge of assaulting an officer, <PERSON> Senkir </PERSON> said. Besides passing out food, Food Not Bombs distributed leaflets saying the group had been harassed recently by police and had been unfairly characterized by Mayor <PERSON> Art </PERSON> <PERSON> Agnos </PERSON> as being interested in exploiting the homeless and hungry.

 Wearing a yellow poncho in the steady rain, 10-year-old <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Nathaniel </PERSON> helped her mother stock their gray tent with camping supplies: sleeping bags, thin mattresses and a cooler. Outside the tent, beneath a cluster of sturdy oak trees, they had a clear view of the 12-foot fence, topped with a spiral of barbed wire, that surrounded them and the rest of the <ORGANIZATION> Dwight </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correctional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION>' only prison for women. But inside, at the start of an overnight campout for inmates and their children, they could ignore the fence, be alone and, if only for a few hours, do the things that mothers and daughters do. `` It gives me pleasure today to sleep with her, to comb her hair, to wash her,'' said <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON>'s mother, <PERSON> Cathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Nathaniel </PERSON>, a convicted murderer. The campout on the last weekend of August was the last of three held over the summer at <LOCATION> Dwight </LOCATION>, located some 75 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. About 80 children and 36 inmates took part in the program, funded by a federal grant, said Warden <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Huch </PERSON>. The children arrived on a Saturday morning, stayed overnight in tents with their mothers and left the next day. Volleyball, crafts, a play performed by the prison drama club and an evening bonfire helped fill their time. The overnight visit gave <PERSON> Sheryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Decker </PERSON>, 37, a chance to have some `` girl talk'' with her 17-year-old daughter, <PERSON> Debbie </PERSON>, but it did n't completely ease the pain of separation. `` When we look at each other and I know she's got to go beyond that fence, you know it hurts, and we know it for a minute but then we shrug it off and we go on,'' Ms. <PERSON> Decker </PERSON> said. `` We kind of play and get it up out of our system. But it's coming.'' For Ms. <PERSON> Decker </PERSON> and Ms. <PERSON> Nathaniel </PERSON>, separation from their children is the hardest part of imprisonment. `` That is the punishment, that's it,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Nathaniel </PERSON>, who hopes to be paroled in 4 -LCB- years. But the visits help. Imprisonment means missing experiences that other mothers and daughters share, said Ms. <PERSON> Decker </PERSON>, who hopes to be paroled in three years from an 18-year term for armed violence. `` You go to sleep at night and you wake up and it's to the same thing every day,'' she said. `` It's not like being with your child and raising them and teaching them the facts of life, going through their first dating experience ... finding her first love.'' Ordinary visits can last from 9 a.m. to 3 p.m. on a weekday or until 7 p.m. on weekends, but Ms. <PERSON> Decker </PERSON> said it's not enough. `` You really do n't have time to really talk about the most important parts of a daughter-and-mother relationship,'' she said. Ms. <PERSON> Decker </PERSON> has been in prison for six years, since her daughter was 11. At first <PERSON> Debbie </PERSON> lived with foster parents, then at a children's home. Now she lives alone in the central <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> as she begins her senior year in high school. She cries as she describes life without her mother, whom she calls her best friend. `` You know how you get up for school and your mom always tells you you look nice or you go to prom and they're there,'' she says, haltingly, adding that for her, `` they're not there.'' <PERSON> Luz </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferro </PERSON>, 26, has been in <PERSON> Dwight </PERSON> on a drug-dealing conviction for nearly half of her 4-year-old daughter's life. Ms. <PERSON> Ferro </PERSON> says her daughter, <LOCATION> Karina </LOCATION>, who is living with her sister-in-law in <LOCATION> Waukegan </LOCATION>, is too young to fully understand why they have to be separated. `` Today she saw this little tent. She said, `` Oh Mama, this is wonderful,' and I said ` Yes, honey, we're going to be sleeping here tonight.' `` And she said, ` What about tomorrow night?' and I said ` No, you've got to go back home.' `` She said, ` Why Mommy, why do I have to go back? Why ca n't I stay here and we can sleep in the tent?''' That's when Ms. <PERSON> Ferro </PERSON> tried to explain punishment and what it means. `` I tell her ... they punished me because I did something wrong and the punishment is I have to stay away from you,'' she said. `` That's the punishment.''

<HEAD>Poll: 80 Percent Satisfied With Public Education, But Prefer

<DATELINE>EMMAUS, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 More than 80 percent of parents are satisfied with their children's public schools, but if they had the money, more than half would send their children to private schools, a poll shows. The survey, commissioned by <ORGANIZATION> Children </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> magazine </ORGANIZATION>, shows that 41 percent of parents said they were very satisfied with their child's public school, and another 40 percent said they were somewhat satisfied But if money were no object, 51 percent would choose to send their child to a private or parochial school, according to the survey. The poll, which has a margin of error of plus or minus 6 percentage points, drew from a sample of 305 parents with children in public schools. The poll is included in a report in the magazine's October issue, `` Report Card on Public Education.'' <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Meade </PERSON>, a senior editor of the magazine, writes that many education experts play down the popular solutions to solving the country's education problems, such as tougher graduation requirements, more homework and teacher competency tests, in favor of more parent involvement and more creative school management. The current education system is inadequate, <PERSON> Meade </PERSON> writes, and that inadequacy goes beyond sagging grades in the basics. Absenteeism, violence, drug use and social isolation are now a large part of the public school student's environment, <PERSON> Meade </PERSON> writes. The typical high school student winds up cutting 10 classes a year, and one out of four high school students drop out, he writes. More and more students have both parents working outside the home, <PERSON> Meade </PERSON> writes, but schools are not adapting to the shifting family structure. For a community to battle these problems, <PERSON> Meade </PERSON> says the atmosphere of its school has to improve: Parents have to become more involved, ask more questions and take part in curriculum planning, principals have to be more interested in education than in management, and teachers should have more say in their own educational programs.

<HEAD>U.S. Cruiser's Postpones Departure After Reported Government
Protest</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANAMA, Bahrain (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The scheduled pullout of the missile cruiser <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> from the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> region has been postponed because at least one Arab government objected to its departure, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military sources said. The 9,600-ton cruiser was to have ended its patrol duties with the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Middle East on Sunday and was earlier reported to have left. In reducing the force from 27 to 26 ships, the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> would have represented the first cutback by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> since the Aug. 20 cease-fire in the Iraq-Iran war. The military sources, insisting on anonymity, on Monday said the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> was remaining on station in the <LOCATION> Arabian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>, possibly for another five days. The change of orders was based on diplomatic rather than military considerations, and `` came from a much higher level than the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> in the gulf,'' said one source. That source, speaking on condition of anonymity, also said the Pentagon decision not to replace the cruiser still stood. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military and diplomatic sources said they could not identify the Arab state that raised objections to the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> leaving the region. The <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION>, one of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s powerful `` Aegis'' cruisers, is winding up a tour that was marred by its mistaken downing of an Iranian jetliner on July 3, killing all 290 people aboard. The <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION>, which carries a crew of 385, left its home port at <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> in late April and entered the gulf on May 27, conducting air surveillance in the <LOCATION> Strait </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hormuz </LOCATION> and southern gulf.

<TEXT>
 Flood waters receded today in some of the hardest hit parts of <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>, but the country still faces massive problems in getting food, medicine and safe drinking water to millions of marooned people. `` We will have to feed the people for two months at least,'' President <PERSON> Hussain </PERSON> <PERSON> Muhammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Ershad </PERSON> said after a helicopter flight over villages and rice paddies swamped by flood waters that cover three-fourths of this impoverished nation of 110 million people. The floods that started in June, then eased only to surge again last week, have killed at least 406 people by government count. But this figure is generally regarded as understated, and daily tallies reported by <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION> newspapers put the death toll at 1,122. The Health Ministry says more than 100,000 people are known to be suffering from diarrhea and 5,715 more from dysentery as a result of drinking contaminated water. In <LOCATION> Rajbari </LOCATION>, a town of 50,000 people 45 miles west of <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION>, people stood in chest-deep water as a motorboat carried <PERSON> Ershad </PERSON> past their flooded houses. He disembarked at a relief camp set up in a government school and handed out new, bright pink 50-taka notes -LRB- worth about 1.55 cents -RRB- to people crowding around him. He plunged into the flood water that surged past his knees as small boys splashed and paddled in the muddy brown swirl around him. About 800,000 people live in the <LOCATION> Rajbari </LOCATION> district, which includes hundreds of outlying villages. <PERSON> Munshi </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Latif </PERSON>, a member of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> from the district, estimated at least 500,000 were temporarily displaced by the flood and had sought refuge on higher ground. He said at least 15,000 houses were destroyed. The biggest problem at the moment, <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Latif </PERSON> said, was a virtual absence of fuel that has left people without any means of cooking rice or any other food they had managed to save from the flood. The government has used boats and helicopters to ferry food, mainly rice, to people stranded on bits of high ground. But with only a dozen helicopters in service, the task is proceeding slowly. Wing commander <PERSON> Firdaus </PERSON>, a helicopter pilot who uses only one name, said he had made 30 relief flights in the last three days. `` In some villages we ca n't even land,'' he said. `` We just have to drop the food.'' The flood control center said 12 major rivers were still rising today, but three of the mightiest rivers _ the <LOCATION> Ganges </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brahmaputra </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Meghna </LOCATION> _ have started receding. This could be seen clearly in today's helicopter flight over four administrative districts west of the capital. Bright green rice plants poked above the flood level in neatly defined rectangular fields. During a helicopter flight over the same area 24 hours earlier, the paddies were completely submerged. Information Minister <PERSON> Mahbubur </PERSON> <PERSON> Rahman </PERSON> told reporters Monday that 50 of the country's 64 districts have been `` directly affected'' by floods and 21 million people rendered homeless. He said 25 million people had lost relatives, a home or business, crops or other property. The diarrhea cases primarily have hit the interior but were also reported today in <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION>, a city of 6 million. <PERSON> Rahmat </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON>, a municipal official, said flood waters had entere the city's drinking supply through leaky pipes Floods are an annual monsoon event in <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>, a disaster that accompanies the blessing of rain for the crops, but <PERSON> Rahman </PERSON> and other officials said those of 1988 are the worst in memory. Last year's floods killed about 300 people, <PERSON> Rahman </PERSON> said, but <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION> newspapers put the 1987 toll at 1,500. <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>, whose per capita annual income of $ 150, is one of the world's poorest nations. Rivers run through it like veins, making it a sort of giant drain pipe for flood waters that pour south into the Bay of <LOCATION> Bengal </LOCATION>.

 Police in several cities arrested demonstrators in wheelchairs who blocked crowded Greyhound terminals in a protest in which they charged the buses are inaccessible to disabled riders. Participants in some of the demonstrations, organized by American Disabled for <ORGANIZATION> Accessible </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION>, or ADAPT, blocked travelers' entry to buses Monday, police said. Five protesters in wheelchairs and one blind demonstrator were arrested in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> and taken to jail, said police Sgt. <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walters </PERSON>. Arrests also occurred in <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, and an organizer said the protests occurred in several other cities. `` This is a very busy day for us,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Gravley </PERSON>, a spokesman for Dallas-based <ORGANIZATION> Greyhound </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` It's a holiday weekend. People are going home and thousands of people are being inconvenienced because buses are being delayed.'' Leaders of the Denver-based civil rights group said the arrests would focus on the plight of low-income disabled people who can not afford cars. ADAPT wants Greyhound to install lifts on buses for those in wheelchairs. `` We're asking them to sign an agreement that any new bus built will be accessible,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> <PERSON> Blank </PERSON>, an ADAPT spokesman in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>. Greyhound officials met leaders of ADAPT in August and will do so again this month, <PERSON> Gravley </PERSON> said. `` We went through all of this in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` We thought we responded in a forthright way to issues they raised. We are disappointed obviously that the demonstrations continued.'' In <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, 10 people, including eight in wheelchairs, were cited for disturbing the peace. In <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, a protest involving 25 people resulted in the arrests of eight demonstrators, six in wheelchairs. Protests also were scheduled Monday in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Blank </PERSON> said, with one in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> set for today. <PERSON> Gravley </PERSON> said a Greyhound subsidiary has applied for a grant to use toward designing an exprimental bus that would be accessible to the disabled. The company has proposed creation of an advisory group comprised of some ADAPT members, he said. Greyhound operates Helping Hands, a program that provides a free ticket for disabled people who are unable to travel by themselves.

 Eyeglasses with blue and yellow lenses sold for $ 5,400 today as a four-day auction began of rock star <PERSON> Elton </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON>'s belongings _ from diamante-soled platform boots to Rembrandt etchings <PERSON> Sotheby </PERSON>'s auction house predicted the 1,922 lots would bring in more than $ 3 milion pounds -LRB- $ 5 million -RRB-. The sale catalogue alone costs 40 pounds -LRB- $ 67 -RRB- and already is a collector's item. <PERSON> John </PERSON>, 41, singer, pianist and composer, is selling everything in the collection he put together over 20 years and kept at <ORGANIZATION> Woodside </ORGANIZATION>, his mansion near <LOCATION> Windsor </LOCATION>, west of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. Today, eyeglasses with blue and yellow lenses sold for 3,200 pounds -LRB- $ 5,400 -RRB-. The buyer of the eyeglasses, like all the early purchasers, remained anonymous. <PERSON> Mitch </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michele </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, flew to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to bid for memorabilia. `` I have been an Elton <PERSON> John </PERSON> fan for 15 years and keep trying to meet him, but with no luck yet,'' said <PERSON> Mitch </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>, wearing a straw boater hat and glitzy, Elton John-style eyeglasses. Hundreds of telephone calls from overseas bidders sent prices well above catalogue listings, <ORGANIZATION> Sotheby </ORGANIZATION>'s said today. Four personalized car license plates went for 2,400 pounds -LRB- 4,056 dollars -RRB-, instead of the 250 pounds -LRB- 422 dollars -RRB- listed in the catalogue.

<HEAD>Foreign Ministry Workers Resign From Party En Masse</HEAD>

<DATELINE>RANGOON, Burma (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 All 187 <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> workers who belonged to <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s ruling party resigned from the party and employees of 16 diplomatic missions have expressed support for the formation of an interim government, ministry sources said today. A statement from ministry employees said the workers decided Monday to resign from the <ORGANIZATION> Burma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which protesters blame for 26 years of repression and ruinous economic policies. Ministry sources said that with the exception of the ambassadors, employees at 16 of the 26 foreign missions have supported demands for formation of an interim government to lead <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> to democracy. The statement appealed for support from foreign missions: `` We have now reached a stage where the government should comply forthwith with the people's wishes. Any responsible government would have done so long ago. `` Procrastination in any form by the government, either by resorting to irrelevant legal procedures or by various maneuvers, tactics, -LRB- and -RRB- ruses designed to retain the reins of power would inevitably bring about immense suffering to the people, together with the ultimate threat of ... strife.'' `` We must prevent such an outcome at all costs so those schoolchildren, students and martyrs who have valiantly given up their lives in this historic struggle would not have died in vain,'' it said. Many government departments have stated opposition to the government; some have held street demonstrations. This has crippled President <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON>'s administration, which faces the threat of nationwide demonstrations Thursday unless it yields to demands for an interim government. Lawlessness spread to the capital today as looters stripped three government warehouses. Authorities made no attempt to intervene. Sources said hundreds of people carried away bags of rice from a warehouse in western <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>. In brisk business near the warehouse, they sold the rice to merchants for 100 kyats, or 17 cents per 165-pound bag _ a quarter of the normal price. Nearby, looters took frozen fish, trays and equipment from a <ORGANIZATION> Fisheries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> warehouse and another group stole provisions and office equipment from a Food and <ORGANIZATION> Beverages </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> warehouse near <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> University. Residents of the <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Okkalapa </LOCATION> earlier reported at least 20 people died in a clash at a biscuit factory between looters and members of a neighborhood committee. The government says the party leadership will meet Monday to consider organizing a referendum on one-party rule. Some diplomats speculate the chaos is being orchestrated to create an excuse for the party to re-establish itself or for military intervention. On Monday, opposition leaders <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> San </PERSON> <PERSON> Suu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyi </PERSON> and former Defense Minister Tin Oo threw their support to a demand by one student group that an interim government be formed by Wednesday night or protests will follow Thursday. <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s turmoil mounted after students rioted last September to protest economic policies and then led broader-based street protests in March and June. Street riots flared anew after Ne Win resigned July 23 following 26 years in power and the party chose <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON> to succeed him. Government radio said at least 112 people died in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> in rioting against <PERSON> Sein </PERSON> <PERSON> Lwin </PERSON>, who resigned after 17 days in power. Demonstrations have been largely peaceful since <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> took office Aug. 19 as the first civilian leader in 26 years.

<HEAD>Seattle Blackout Ended, Utility Crews Turn to Preventing
Recurrence</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 With power restored in a 50-block downtown area after a four-day blackout, crews are checking for wiring similar to the kind that contributed to the city-owned utility's worst outage. The precise cause of the fire that resulted in the outage Wednesday remained undetermined. Power to all but one building in the city's retail, financial and hotel core was restored by Sunday evening. <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> City Light officials attributed the severity of the blackout to the melting of an aluminum, direct-current supply cable for overhead electrical trolley bus lines in an underground vault that also contained six of the utility's 13,000-volt feeder cables. During the height of the blackout, officials estimated that 90 percent of all businesses were closed in the area, which included an estimated 130 restaurants, 55 shops in the popular Pike Place Market, the <LOCATION> Bon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Marche </LOCATION> department store, the 875-room Westin Hotel and uncounted other hotels, food stores and taverns. City Light officials said they had no estimate of the utility's losses and the costs of restoring power There was no cost estimate available for losses sustained by the utility's customers. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Forslund </PERSON>, a utility spokesman, said it might be several days before power is restored to the last building without service, a parking garage near the vault, because its low-voltage supply lines were destroyed in the same fire that wrecked the feeder cables. The fire began in low-voltage utility lines between transformers in the vault and individual buildings, said City Light assistant superintendent <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Garman </PERSON>. As the system heated, power to the high-voltage feeder cables should have been cut by `` current limiters,'' but the transit cable melted, and its molten aluminum cut the high-voltage cables before power could be shut off to all but two of them. `` When aluminum melts, it's just like adding gasoline'' to a fire, <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Light </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> McIntosh </PERSON> said. `` It took what would have been a minor inconvenience and turned it into a major event,'' <PERSON> Garman </PERSON> said. `` It's like we had eight or nine welding torches going at the same time.'' City Light crews will check other locations with similar combinations of utility and <ORGANIZATION> Metro </ORGANIZATION> cables to try to prevent a similar outage, <PERSON> Garman </PERSON> said.

 <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>, who has admitted taking part in the 1985 <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> hijacking in which a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> diver was killed, testified today that he rejects `` all forms of violence.'' <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> is charged with air piracy and murder in connection with the hijacking. Thirty-nine Americans were held captive for 17 days and diver <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON> was shot and killed after <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> Flight 847 was seized on a flight from <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> and diverted to <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>, a Lebanese Shiite Moslem, says he was among the hijackers, but insists he did not kill <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON> and that he tried to dissuade an accomplice from shooting the 23-year-old sailor. Today, Chief Judge <PERSON> Heiner </PERSON> <PERSON> Mueckenberger </PERSON> asked <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> whether he renounced violence. <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> replied: `` Yes. Before the hijacking I thought such methods were right. But now I realize you can fight for your homeland without using weapons. I reject all kinds of violence.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have indicted four people in the hijacking, including <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>. The other three suspects remain at large. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> rejected a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> extradition request for <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> after two West Germans were taken captive in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> by kidnappers seeking <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>'s release. <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> has testified that the hijackers' goal was to force the release of Lebanese Shiites imprisoned in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Shortly after hijacking, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> freed about 700 Lebanese. The defendant repeated that he did not kill <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON>. `` I already said the other -LRB- one of his accomplices -RRB- was responsible and he was the murderer,'' <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> said. `` Our orders were not to kill. We were told to hijack the plane, to force it to land and to state our demands. But not to kill,'' he said. He refused to say who issued the orders. <PERSON> Mueckenberger </PERSON> asked <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> where he got the weapons used in the hijacking. `` On the plane itself,'' <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> replied. He refused to say how the weapons got there. <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> said the hijackers had two hand grenades and a pistol. Under West German law, the <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> court can convict <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> of murder even if he did not pull the trigger. <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>, who West German officials say is 24 years old, faces a maximum sentence of life imprisonment. Court spokesman <PERSON> Falk </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said the court had set aside Wednesday and Friday for testimony from two <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens. He declined to identify the witnesses. Flight 847 pilot <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Testrake </PERSON> and other members of the plane's crew are scheduled to start testifying Sept. 12 <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> was arrested on Jan. 13, 1987, at <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> airport when customs inspectors found explosives in his luggage. His trial began July 5 in a courtroom inside Preungesheim prison. In April, a <LOCATION> Duesseldorf </LOCATION> court sentenced one of his brothers, <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>, to 13 years in prison for kidnapping two German businessmen in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> in an unsuccessful bid to force <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> to free <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON>. One of the West Germans was freed but the other remains a hostage.

 The national <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> deleted all criticisms of its efforts to fight AIDS among minorities before making public its report on the subject, The Atlanta Constitution reported today. <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> acknowledged that parts of the analysis were condensed from 16 pages to two pages after they were reviewed by <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> officials, but the newspaper quoted him as refusing to say why the agency deleted critical sections of the report. The newspaper cited government records as its source but did not elaborate. <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> has not yet developed an overall strategy to fight AIDS among blacks and Hispanics, who account for more than 40 percent of the victims of the disease. `` If we were to craft a specific, forward-looking game plan, we would involve them in crafting it,'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> paid a private consultant $ 12,000 for an analysis of its efforts to fight acquired immune deficiency syndrome among blacks and Hispanics. Among other things, the consultant's report said <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> had no `` cohesive plan of action'' to prevent AIDS among minorities and is unaware of how much of the money given to local health departments for minority AIDS programs actually reached minority populations. The report also said the agency does not have information about the `` knowledge, attitudes and behaviors'' of minority populations. <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> said the consultant's study was not intended to be used by the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> to provide an overall picture of its efforts to prevent and control AIDS among minorities. He said it was designed to provide him with information to present at a conference of minority health workers and to summarize <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> grants to minority AIDS programs. Surgeon General <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Everett </PERSON> <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> has said the only way to control AIDS is by educating high-risk segments of the population. The <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> estimates that among blacks and Hispanics there are 200,000 infected homosexual and bisexual men, 200,000 infected heterosexual drug users, 100,000 infected women and 15,000 infected children and infants.

 A deputy has been assigned to provide security for the family of <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> for the past five months, a measure defended by the county sheriff as a valid use of tax money. `` I'd say it's public money going to protect a public family,'' <LOCATION> Fulton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lankford </PERSON> was quoted as saying in today's editions of The Atlanta Constitution. `` Anything that happened to the King family at this juncture would become international.'' King was assassinated April 4, 1968, in <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>. His mother, <PERSON> Alberta </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, was shot to death in 1975 while playing the organ for a Sunday service in an <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> church `` It would be an indictment, I think, against our community if another tragedy would befall the family,'' the sheriff said in acknowledging he assigned deputy <PERSON> Angelo </PERSON> <PERSON> Willoughby </PERSON> to the post. The newspaper said it learned of the deputy's hiring through county records. County Manager <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Brownlee </PERSON> said the county commission should have been asked to approve the assignment because it amounts to publicly financed protection for a private family. `` That is not something the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commissioners </ORGANIZATION> has authorized,'' he said. `` That's something the sheriff has done.'' <PERSON> Willoughby </PERSON> reports daily to the Martin Luther King Jr.. Center for Non-violent Social Change `` I do n't know if I would say he's a bodyguard, but he's there for the protection of the family as well as for the security of the center itself,'' <PERSON> Lankford </PERSON> said. The civil rights leader's son, <LOCATION> Fulton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Commissioner <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, said he appreciates the officer's presence. `` I carry the name <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> and that draws crackpots,'' he said. `` A guy came up and approached my mother -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Coretta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scott </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> King </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- last week,'' <PERSON> King </PERSON> said. `` He was just crazy.

The woman and her partner, who survived after finding his way out of the cave, had finished a cave-diving course Sunday in the cave that is marked with arrows pointing to the entrance. Deputies said the two had been following a line that marks a course but lost sight of it when they had trouble with one of their flashlights. By the time they got the light back on, they had drifted away from the line, and she apparently panicked and swam away. Her partner lost her. Both divers were trained but had made few dives since finishing their training course, <PERSON> Jasper </PERSON> said.

 A fire near an aquatic park offering `` five million gallons and tons of fun'' destroyed eight cars and burned about 10 acres of brush before it was extinguished, authorities said. The fire ignited brush in a section of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Bonnelli </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, said county fire Capt <PERSON> Garry </PERSON> <PERSON> Oversby </PERSON>. It was not immediately known whether Monday's blaze began in a vehicle or in the vegetation, he said, but the flames leaped from car to car. No one was injured. `` Raging Waters is 44 acres, five million gallons and tons of fun for everyone,'' a tape-recorded message at the park, about 25 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, proclaimed. Unfortunately, the aquatic park's currents could n't be tapped to douse the blaze, which broke out less than a mile away in an area used to handle overflow parking, fire officials said. Firefighters had trouble because there were no hydrants in the parking lot, said County fire Inspector <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lenihan </PERSON>. Water was rerouted from hydrants outside the lot and the blaze was extinguished 2 -LCB- hours after it was reported. Damage was estimated at $ 50,000, he said. The park, crowded because of the Labor Day holiday, was not evacuated, said <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> <PERSON> Lemasters </PERSON>, Raging Waters vice president and general manager.

 A blinding explosion split a Greek oil tanker in two in this port near <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> today, killing at least seven people, authorities said. Seventeen others were injured, many of them with severe burns. Harbormaster <PERSON> Manolis </PERSON> <PERSON> Peloponessios </PERSON> said two bodies had been recovered and at least two workers were missing from the 10:15 a.m. blast that shattered the 86,000-ton Anangel Greatness in this industrial port 10 miles west of the capital. `` We fear they -LRB- the two missing workers -RRB- may be trapped in one of the tanks that's now below water,'' <PERSON> Peloponessios </PERSON> said. Harbor authorities say there was no suspicion of terrorism. Instead, authorities say the blast was believed caused by gas fumes left in the vessel's empty oil tanks. Investigators speculate welders working on the ship during routine maintenance and cleaning may have sparked the blast. Last July 11, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> terrorists launched a grenade and machine gun attack that killed nine people and injured 98 others aboard the City of <LOCATION> Poros </LOCATION> ship as it was returning to <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> from a Greek island cruise. The skipper of the Anangel Greatness, Capt. <PERSON> Anastasios </PERSON> <PERSON> Theocharis </PERSON>, said the ship had been certified free of gas before it sailed into <LOCATION> Perama </LOCATION> on Monday. <ORGANIZATION> Merchant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> officials said the ship carried documents showing all gas had been removed. A Perama police officer who requested anonymity said portions of what appeared to be five other bodies had been found but not yet identified. He said the blast `` produced a blinding light in the sky.'' Officials said the explosion in the vessel's No. 3 fuel tank tore apart the ship as about 25 workers were on board for cleaning and maintenance work. Its 28-member crew also was aboard. `` I was in the control room at the stern when I heard a tremendous noise and everything clattered to the deck,'' <PERSON> Theocharis </PERSON> said. `` People were tossed all over the place. There were body fragments landing on the deck of another tanker berthed next to this one,'' said <PERSON> Costas </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakaros </PERSON>, a metalworkers' union official. <PERSON> Sakaros </PERSON> said crew members on the deck of the adjacent tanker, the 300,000-ton Norwegian flag <PERSON> Ingres </PERSON>, were blown into the air by the force of the blast. The green-and-white vessel started sinking but settled in shallow water, covered in oily scum. Five hours after the blast, black fumes still hung over the waterfront. The explosion also shattered windows in stores and offices around <LOCATION> Perama </LOCATION>.

 <LOCATION> HASTINGS </LOCATION>, Neb. -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- - President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, heading back to the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> after a three-week <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> vacation, today saluted a privately supported communications school in a college that runs on a balanced budget as `` a model for our society to follow.'' Dedicating the C.J. and <ORGANIZATION> Marie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gray </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Hastings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said the school's students will be entering a profession that `` at times does not seem to appreciate the simpler virtues.'' In a speech at the dedication of the communications facility, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said, `` I'm told that <ORGANIZATION> Hastings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> operates on a balanced budget.'' `` And the Gray Center itself has raised all its funds in the private sector, not looking toward the government for a special leg up or a free lunch,'' he said. `` That kind of self-reliance is inspiring and a model for our society to follow.'' `` It's a philosophy I hope the students who come here to learn will carry with them when they leave to ply their skills elsewhere in a profession that at times does not seem to appreciate the simpler virtues,'' the president said. The center was built with the help of a $ 1 million grant from former <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> campaign official <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>. A Hastings native, <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> is a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> public relations executive who was director of communications for <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s 1980 campaign for the White House. The center is named for <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>'s parents, <PERSON> Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> and the late <PERSON> Garold </PERSON> <PERSON> C.J </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>. The elder <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> was an electrical engineer and his wife was a house mother at the college. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was also attending a closed fund-raising reception for <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>'s appointed Republican Sen. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Karnes </PERSON> at <LOCATION> Grand </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Neb </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Karnes </PERSON> is seeking election against <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerrey </PERSON>, the state's popular former <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> governor Later in the day, the president was speaking to about 7,500 delegates at an American Legion convention in <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, on his way back to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for the first time since <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was nominated to succeed him. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and his Democratic opponent, <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, will speak to the legionnaires later in the week. In the coming weeks, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> faces a new round of negotiation with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on the thorny issue of aid to Nicaraguan rebels and a busy round of campaigning for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and other Republican candidates. On Wednesday, his first day back at work, the president has scheduled a meeting with Republican congressional leaders. While the agenda has not been announced, the legislative calendar includes aid to the Contra rebels in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, a landmark free trade agreement with <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, 11 appropriations bills, welfare legislation, and confirmation of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s nominations of <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> as secretary of the treasury and <PERSON> Lauro </PERSON> <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON> as secretary of education. Also hanging are backlogs of judicial and diplomatic nominations <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> hopes to see confirmed before he leaves office 4 -LCB- months from now. `` Contra aid is certainly one of the issues we have to deal with right off the bat,'' said <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> has passed a bill which the administration termed minimally acceptable and the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, the biggest hurdle for Contra aid in the past, has not acted. When asked whether the administration wanted to change the bill to include military as well as humanitarian aid, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> declined to answer, saying, `` It's to be a negotiated process.'' Another administration official, speaking on condition he not be identified, said, `` The only way to get the right kind of <LOCATION> Contra </LOCATION> aid is to let <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> do it. The more we come out for things, sometimes the more it does n't help the process.'' In addition to his legislative battles, the president is expected to make about two political trips a week until the election, appearing on behalf of <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> candidates, but also pushing for the election of his vice president to succeed him. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> left <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on August 14 to speak at the Republican National Convention in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. He flew to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> on August 16 and has spent the time since at his 688-acre ranch north of here and in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. Since taking office in 1981, the president has spent 335 days at the ranch. He is expected to return for a few days around Thanksgiving. Officials say <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> may go to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> at the end of September, as he usually does, but <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said no foreign travel is planned before his term ends on Jan. 20.

<HEAD>Iraq Offers Amnesty for Kurdish Rebels</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s ruling <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> today announced a `` general and comprehensive'' amnesty for Kurdish rebels in an apparent effort to counter allegations its forces are using poison gas against the tribesmen. The official <ORGANIZATION> Iraqi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, reported the council said the rebels, whether in <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> or abroad, had 30 days to turn themselves in to be pardoned but would then be allowed to leave the country. Those `` who have obligations abroad, such as jobs or attending school, would be allowed to leave,'' the news agency quoted the announcement as saying. `` Their exit is guaranteed.'' <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>'s move came as Kurdish guerrillas reported fierce fighting in northeast <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> where they said 60,000 troops, with tanks, fighter-bombers and helicopter gunships, were advancing into the rebel strongholds. The rebels are seeking autonomy in their mountainous region, where about 20 million Kurds live in the area where <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> converge. The decree, addressed to `` the glorious <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> nation,'' singled out the Kurds but contained no reference to the Kurds' demand for an autonomous homeland. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s estimated 3.5 million Kurds, about one-fifth of the country's population, have been fighting on and off for 50 years for independence. However, the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> news agency said the amnesty did not extend to `` the traitor,'' <PERSON> Jalal </PERSON> <PERSON> Talabani </PERSON>, leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Patriotic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kurdistan </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Massoud </PERSON> <PERSON> Barzani </PERSON>, leader of the Kurdish <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Talabani </PERSON> and <PERSON> Barzani </PERSON> joined forces with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> during the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> war against <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. Their organizations have long been outlawed by <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. Spokesmen for the two Kurdish parties claim the Iraqis have repeatedly used outlawed chemical weapons against undefended villages in recent days, killing at least 1,900 civilians and wounding 5,000. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has dnied using chemical weapons against the Kurds, although it has admitted using them against Iranian forces during the eight-year gulf war before fighting stopped when a United Nations-sponsored cease-fire took effect Aug. 20. The Iraqi decree said all Kurdish prisoners would be pardoned and `` released immediately ... except those convicted or wanted on other charges.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> statement said the amnesty was based on the Islamic principle of pardoning wrongdoers and `` giving them a chance to repent, even the most devious and cursed.'' Officials in <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> say about 90,000 Kurds have fled across the mountainous border since the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> offensive began last last month. But <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>'s foreign minister, <PERSON> Mesut </PERSON> <PERSON> Yilmaz </PERSON>, said Monday that the heavy influx of Kurds fleeing from <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has ceased because <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> troops who had been battling the Kurds are blocking mountain passes to <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has asked the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> High Commissioner for Refugees to provide aid for several thousand Kurdish refugees fleeing the army offensive in <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> refugee official said today. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> says 2,000 Iraqi Kurds streamed across the border into <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> province in recent days, and another 600 families are heading toward the region, said the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman, <PERSON> Judith </PERSON> <PERSON> Kumin </PERSON>.

 Former <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Alxander </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON>, who led the `` Prague Spring'' reform movement of 1968, is to travel abroad for the first time in 18 years to visit <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, a government spokesman said today.

He said <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON>'s wife came to pick up the travel papers Monday. The Dubceks live in <LOCATION> Bratislava </LOCATION>, capital of the eastern region of <LOCATION> Slovakia </LOCATION>. The party's monthly <PERSON> Novy </PERSON> <PERSON> Mysl </PERSON> said last month that the former Communist leader and his followers were responsible for the `` crisis'' of August 1968, when the country was `` on the brink of civil war.''

 The $ 54 million mystery continued today despite a report by a school janitor who says he holds the ticket that won <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s world-record Lotto jackpot. `` We have not received a claim from anyone,'' <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Schulte </PERSON>, director of communications at the <ORGANIZATION> Lottery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, said this morning. Lottery officials know the ticket with the correct series of six numbers was sold in this central <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> community. But 280 miles away, <LOCATION> Liberty </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff <PERSON> Harrell </PERSON> <PERSON> Revell </PERSON> said Monday night that <LOCATION> Bristol </LOCATION> resident <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> has offered his ticket as the winner. `` It is n't confirmed,'' <PERSON> Revell </PERSON> said, adding he sent a deputy to <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>'s house as a security precaution as word of mouth spread through the tiny <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Panhandle </LOCATION> hamlet. <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>, who told deputies his ticket got wet sitting in a laundry pile, is a janitor at a <LOCATION> Bristol </LOCATION> elementary school, said <PERSON> Revell </PERSON>. Telephone calls to his house late Monday and early today went unanswered. `` People are really interested,'' said <LOCATION> Longwood </LOCATION> police Officer <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hemmert </PERSON>, who was flagged down on patrol by residents who hoped he might know the winner. `` We're up in the air. We're just as curious as anybody else.'' Winners have 180 days to claim their prizes. Lottery officials expected to project the exact payout of Saturday night's Lotto drawing today. The annual payment to the winner will be about $ 2.16 million each year after taxes, using a <ORGANIZATION> Lottery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> formula that divides total winnings by 20 years and deducts 20 percent of the yearly windfall for taxes. <LOCATION> Longwood </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Gunter </PERSON> said he was pleased the winning ticket was bought in his town. `` It might put <ORGANIZATION> Longwood </ORGANIZATION> on the map now,'' he said. The huge jackpot whipped up a ticket-buying avalanche that pushed Saturday's sales to 14.6 million and total weekly Lotto purchases to almost 45 million. The <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> jackpot topped the previous <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> record prize for a numbers game, the $ 51.4 million shared by two people who bought winning tickets for <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s lottery on June 4.

<TEXT>
 Israeli troops isolated an occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> town today, setting up makeshift army bases, cutting telephone lines and arresting dozens of Palestinians suspected of inciting riots, the army and <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> witnesses said. During today's operation in <LOCATION> Qalqilya </LOCATION>, 55 miles north of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, troops discovered stashes of knives, hatchets, clubs, and underground leaflets outlawed by <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> authorities, an army spokesman said. Jewish settlers have claimed Palestinians from <LOCATION> Qalqilya </LOCATION> are key instigators of firebomb and stone-throwing attacks and complained they scattered nails on <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> roads. An army spokesman said troops today imposed a pre-dawn curfew and closed all roads to the town of about 10,000 because the army planned to carry out an `` operation of several stages.'' He declined to elaborate. In all, five <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> towns and refugee camps were under curfew today, confining some 40,000 people to their homes. Arab taxi drivers turned back at army roadblocks reported seeing four helicopters flying overhead and dozens of army vehicles, some pulling mobile homes that were apparently being used as makeshift army bases. They said troops knocked down a wall separating a playground and high school and were pitching tents on the grounds. Police conducted an overnight arrest campaign in <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> east </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, taking 13 Arabs into custody, a spokesman said. Security forces also arrested four <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> Monday night, including two journalists who work for pro-PLO newspapers. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> began the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s election campaign with a vow to return occupied territory in exchange for peace. He said such a move would assure a stronger <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> with a clear Jewish majority. `` We shall rid ourselves of <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>, we shall rid ourselves of areas densely populated by Arabs,'' <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> told 3,000 supporters Monday night in <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>. `` We shall remain many Jews on much land, not a Jewish minority with an impossible burden of territories.'' <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> also called on Palestinians to end the Arab uprising and start peace talks with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Since the uprising began Dec. 8 in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, 258 Palestinians have been killed. Four Israelis have died. The territories were occupied by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. The army, meanwhile, issued orders barring troops from hurling tear gas into enclosed spaces following an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> medical investigation last May showing the practice endangers human lives. The new policy followed charges from Palestinian and international human rights groups that the gas was being improperly thrown into closed quarters despite manufacturers specifications that it be used only in open spaces. In a report last month, the London-based human rights group, <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> said at least seven Palestinians had died as a result of the improper use of tear gas. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> puts the number of deaths from tear gassing at 13 since the uprising began Dec. 8. An American tear gas manufacturer, <ORGANIZATION> TransTechnology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Sherman </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Oaks </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, in May suspended its sale of the riot-control substance to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The army has denied any Palestinians died as a result of tear gas, contending <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> consulted biased sources.

During Labor Day appearances and again today, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> recalled <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s praise of Soviet tank mechanics during a European trip last fall. `` Send them to <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, we could use that kind of ability,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said after being told of a trouble-free Soviet tank maneuver. Later, he apologized to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> autoworkers, adding, `` Hey give me a break; I did n't mean anything by it.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said today, `` Do you really believe we in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> have anything to learn from a society where workers have no rights, consumers have no choices and even Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> admits their economy is a shambles? Those Republicans in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> love to blame American workers first.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' speech was interrupted for about 15 minutes by demonstrators, who shouted, `` What about abortion?'' and `` Abortion is murder.'' Supporters of the candidate chanted back, `` We want <PERSON> Mike </PERSON>.'' Several of the demonstrators were removed from the room by people in the crowd, and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> proceeded with his remarks. His position on abortion is that he is personally opposed to it but believes a pregnant woman has the right to make her own decision. In an interview published today in <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential candidate <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said he saw little difference between Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and his predecessors. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> described <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms as `` nothing more than refined Stalinism.'' The <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> senator said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> `` has a different approach to things and his mannerisms and style are unfortunately pleasing to the West ... unfortunately because I do n't think from an ideological point of view he's any different from -LRB- <LOCATION> Leonid </LOCATION> -RRB- <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> or anybody else. `` At a Labor Day rally in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said that during the nearly eight years of a Republican administration `` the rich have gotten richer; the poor have gotten poorer. He said millions of high-paying jobs have been replaced by low-wage positions, and asked: `` Can we afford four more years of that?'' Republican rival <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> touted economic gains under the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, saying the administration has created `` 17 -LCB- million jobs, more disposable income for the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people, lower taxes. ... And all my opponent can do is tell the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people how bad things are.'' The vice president said the campaign is `` about protecting the gains we've made in jobs and peace and it's about how to make new breakthroughs in both areas.'' After full schedules on Labor Day, the symbolic opening of the fall campaign, the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> candidates _ with the exception of <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> _ remained on the road. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> joined <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> at a Labor Day picnic in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> and then headed back to the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was back in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> after Labor Day appearances at the Statue of Liberty and at an ethnic parade in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>. Demonstrators appeared at several events. About 125 anti-abortion activists, by police estimates, were at a Dukakis appearance in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. They waved signs and chanted, `` Life yes, abortion no. <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> of death must go.'' People carrying Dukakis-Bentsen signs stood at the back of the crowd at a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> appearance in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> and shouted: `` Where was <PERSON> George </PERSON>?'' About 30 members of a group called the <ORGANIZATION> AIDS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> to </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unleash </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> heckled <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> and said they were protesting his vote against a $ 30 million appropriation to provide the drug AZT to AIDS victims. Security forces were busy. In <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>, a man with a stun gun on his belt was taken into custody at the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign rally, but he was later released. `` The person did nothing to present a harm to either the vice president or anyone else there,'' said <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Sergek </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> special agent in charge of the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> field office. The <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said another man, who was carrying what police believed was a bomb, was arrested in <LOCATION> Hamtramck </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, shortly before <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s arrival there. The device turned out to be a fake. The 38-year-old <LOCATION> Hamtramck </LOCATION> man was arrested on charges of interfering with a <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> agent, said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Huse </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> office. Labor Day was an occasion for the candidates to spell out the positive and negative themes of their campaigns. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> pressed their claim that jobs created under the Republican administration pay less. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was following `` the standard litany of the liberal left'' with his opposition to the MX and Midgetman missile systems, the Star Wars missile defense program, and two new carrier task forces. `` I would n't be surprised if he thinks that a naval exercise is something you find in <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Fonda </PERSON>'s workout book,'' he said in reference to the actress who was an active opponent of the Vietnam War.

 A sniper fired `` a rain of pellets'' from a high-rise apartment building today, slightly injuring three police officers and closing a busy <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> highway, authorities said. Police said they had pinpointed an 11th-floor apartment as the source of the shots and sent hostage negotiators to talk to a disgruntled tenant, but the man did not respond. Deputy Inspector <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Fogerty </PERSON> said the man apparently had a complaint against the building management. The incident began about 6 a.m. when police responded to reports of shots being fired in the vicinity of the building. The officers stationed themselves along the FDR Drive beside the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> near the <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION>. Police did not describe the type of weapon used, but First Deputy Commissioner <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Condon </PERSON> said `` a rain of pellets'' fell on the officers. Scores of emergency service officers, highway and patrol officers rushed to the scene, cordoning off a four-block area. The busy FDR Drive, a main conduit into <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Queens </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION>, was closed in both directions in the area. Three pellets superficially wounded three officers. A fourth struck an officer but did not pierce his skin. <PERSON> Fogerty </PERSON> described the man only as being Asian and said he believes he has two children. Police called for an interpreter who speaks Mandarin Chinese. <PERSON> Fogerty </PERSON> said the man refused to open his door, but police could hear voices inside the apartment. Police also tried to call the man but believe his phone may have been disconnected. Officers lowered a video camera from the 12th floor to look into the apartment's windows. Authorities said they could see no people but spotted furniture barricading the front door. <PERSON> Victoria </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>, who lives on the building's 18th floor, said the man believed to be firig the shots recently moved in and had a reputation for having a bad temper. `` He gets into it with management and the tenants,'' she said.

 The government charged today that cash, jewelry, fine wines and fruits were given to the nation's former chief law enforcement officer by defendants in the influence-peddling trial of <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>'s son-in-law. As the trial before a three-member military tribunal entered its second day, prosecutors alleged defendants gave former Interior Minister <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> Shchelokov </PERSON>, then the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s top police officer and a protege of <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>, gifts ranging from neckties to three pearls valued at $ 5,300 each. The indictment, which is being read in court, said <PERSON> Shchelokov </PERSON> was picky about the gifts he accepted and often refused things that did n't suit him. The charges provided the most detailed account yet of official corruption at the top levels of the <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> regime. Recent newspaper reports say <PERSON> Shchelokov </PERSON> took $ 1.1 million in state funds, gave foreign luxury cars to his children and bought furs and crystal chandeliers for himself and his family. He was fired by <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>'s successor, <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Andropov </PERSON>, and died in December 1984 at age 73. <PERSON> Shchelokov </PERSON> and his wife are said to have committed suicide, and the indictment read today confirmed the former interior minister did indeed kill himself. The court documents said boxes of money were left on <PERSON> Shchelekov </PERSON>'s desk and that one of the nine defendants gave him 105,000 rubles -LRB- $ 170,000 -RRB-. `` He wanted good, dry wines,'' the indictment said, adding that the defendants obliged him. Six times a year, shipments from the <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> republic of <LOCATION> Uzbekistan </LOCATION> would arrive at a <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> airport and be taken to <PERSON> Shchelekov </PERSON>'s country home outside the capital. The indictment said the shipments contained cognac, tomatoes as well as melons, apricots and other fruits unobtainable in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> most of the year. When he received gifts he liked, the account said, the interior minister would politely accept them by saying, `` I thank you.'' Sometimes, however, he refused to take things he did n't want. According to the indictment, <PERSON> Shchelekov </PERSON> once was taken to a factory in <LOCATION> Uzbekistan </LOCATION> and offered clothes and other products made there. He reportedly declined and asked instead for a piece of jewelry for his wife. The central figure among the nine defendants, 51-year-old <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Churbanov </PERSON>, was <PERSON> Shchelokov </PERSON>'s deputy and could face the death penalty if convicted on charges he accepted bribes and gifts such as wine, cognac and grapes flown to him via the Soviet airline <ORGANIZATION> Aeroflot </ORGANIZATION> from <LOCATION> Uzbekistan </LOCATION>. One defendant was out sick today, and two others were treated by a doctor in the courtroom. A judge at the military tribunal announced that <PERSON> Khushvan </PERSON> <PERSON> Norbutaev </PERSON> would not attend today's session, and the defendant's lawyer, <PERSON> Olga </PERSON> <PERSON> Rakitina </PERSON>, said the former regional police chief from <LOCATION> Uzbekistan </LOCATION> was suffering from angina pectoris, a painful but not necessarily dangerous heart condition She sought a recess, saying her client was entitled to hear everything that goes on in court, but the judge rejected the request and a clerk then continued reading the indictment. A physician later gave heart medicine to another defendant, <PERSON> Tashtimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Kakhramanov </PERSON>, and administered stomach pills to <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dzhamalov </PERSON>. The trial is considered part of <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s effort to separate his leadership from the corruption of <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>'s rule, which began in 1964 and ended with the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief's 1982 death. <PERSON> Churbanov </PERSON> married <PERSON> Galina </PERSON> <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> in 1971. He had worked as a mechanic before taking a low-level <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> job in 1961. Official media have reported extensively on the trial, which is expected to last about two months. Some foreign reporters also are being allowed to attend. During Monday's reading of the charges, it was repeatedly alleged that <PERSON> Churbanov </PERSON> received the bribes from provincial officials due to his connection with <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>. It said the co-defendants were among those who bribed <PERSON> Churbanov </PERSON>. <PERSON> Churbanov </PERSON> also requested and received government construction materials for a summer house, the indictment said. He was quoted as saying gift-giving was merely a sign of friendship in <LOCATION> Uzbekistan </LOCATION>, a republic in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. His co-defendants, accused taking bribes as well as giving them, are former Interior Minister <PERSON> Khaidar </PERSON> <PERSON> Yakhyaev </PERSON>, 61, of <LOCATION> Uzbekistan </LOCATION>; his former deputies <PERSON> Pyotr </PERSON> <PERSON> Begelman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kakhramanov </PERSON>, and former regional police chiefs identified as <PERSON> Norbutaev </PERSON>, <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sabirov </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dzhamalov </PERSON>, <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Norov </PERSON> and <PERSON> Y. </PERSON> <PERSON> Makhamadzhanov </PERSON>. According to Pravda, beginning in the 1970s cotton harvests in <LOCATION> Uzbekistan </LOCATION> were padded by almost 1 million tons annually, with the government made to pay for the non-existent crop by corrupt officials. `` Today it has been proven that the cotton barons stole more than 4 billion rubles -LRB- $ 6.34 billion -RRB- from the state, half of which they stuffed into their own pockets,'' the official <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> daily reported earlier this year.

 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> today criticized <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for saying <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> auto plants could use the abilities of Soviet mechanics, and he accused the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration of `` trying to break unions and pit management against labor.'' Last fall on a trip to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he'd been told in a meeting of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> ministers that 350 Soviet tanks had recently completed maneuvers without a breakdown. `` Hey, when the mechanics who keep those tanks running run out of work in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, send them to <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> because we could use that kind of ability,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said at the time. Later, he apologized to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> autoworkers, adding, `` Hey give me a break; I did n't mean anything by it.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, in a meeting today with hundreds of Polish-Americans and others at a banquet hall outside <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, praised the Polish workers' union Solidarity while taking aim at <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration labor policies. `` They do n't understand that Solidarity is n't just a beautiful word in Polish; it's also a beautiful word in English,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` That's why they've spent the last seven years trying to break unions and pit management againstqbor.'' The Democratic nominee chided <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for the vice president's remarks about Soviet mechanics `` I agree we have to pay attention to quality _ from the assembly lines to the executive suites,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` But do you really believe we in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> have anything to learn from a society where workers have no rights, consumers have no choices and even Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> admits their economy is a shambles? Those Republicans in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> love to blame American workers first.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' speech was interrupted for about 15 minutes by demonstrators, who shouted, `` What about abortion?'' and `` Abortion is murder.'' Supporters of the candidate chanted back, `` We want <PERSON> Mike </PERSON>.'' Several of the demonstrators were removed from the room by people in the crowd, and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> proceeded with his remarks. His position on abortion is that he is personally opposed to it but believes a pregnant woman has the right to make her own decision. There was scuffling, but police said there were no arrests. One of the demonstrators, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON>, said several anti-abortion groups met a week ago and decided to organize protests. `` If <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is within 300 miles of a pro-life activist, we're going to go out and greet him,'' he said. As <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON> spoke to reporters he was jostled by other people in the crowd, one of whom ripped his jacket. One spectator obviously upset by the demonstators, <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> <PERSON> Reis </PERSON>, said he opposes abortion and has donated money to pro-life groups. He said he would make no further donations, adding, `` I think they're full of hate, not full of love.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was also to meet in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> today with state <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> leaders, but <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was not included. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was very upset over the omission, the latest in a series of what he has perceived as slights by the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign, said a source close to the former presidential candidate. Another confidant said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> has expressed concern about his contacts with the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign, and `` whether or not he's going to be able to do what he could and should do for the ticket.'' Both sources spoke on condition they not be identified by name. In <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' state press secretary <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Erwin </PERSON> said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was not included in the meetings because he is regarded as a national leader and today's meetings were to focus on the <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> state campaign. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' remarks today about <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> marked a continuation of the effort <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has made in the past week to portray his <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> rival as out of touch with average Americans. From <PERSON> Illinois </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was heading to another key industrial state, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, after marking the traditional Labor Day kickoff of the fall campaign Monday with appearances in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>. While <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaigned, his top campaign aides were to resume discussions with the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> camp on a fall debate schedule. After an appearance in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> on Monday, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> sized up the final nine weeks of his contest with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as a `` tough, competitive race'' he believes will swing on which candidate that low - and moderate-income Americans believe is most qualified to direct the nation's economy <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said he hoped to keep the focus on substantive issues but said it has become clear in recent weeks that Republicans are more intent on attacking him personally. `` If they want a tough, aggressive campaign, I'm happy to give it to them,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` The signs are good and we're raring to go.'' At all of his Monday stops and again today <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> criticized <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for calling last month's rise in national unemployment `` statistically irrelevant,'' portraying the vice president as the standard bearer of the rich and insensitive to the needs of working Americans. `` I do n't think he really understands average Americans very well,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said in a meeting with local reporters in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>. `` I do n't think he really understands what average families are going through these days.'' The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor, repeatedly invoking the theme `` bring prosperity home,'' said the Reagan-Bush legacy will leave families working harder than eight years ago to pay their bills, with millions unable to afford new homes or college educations for their children.

<HEAD>Union Leader Finally Gets To Testify In Treason Trial</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID CRARY</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A prominent black union leader accused of leading an attempted political takeover of a black township took the witness stand Tuesday for the first time in his year-old treason trial. <PERSON> Moses </PERSON> <PERSON> Mayekiso </PERSON>, head of the country's largest metalworkers union, and four co-defendants are charged with seeking to usurp state authority and install their anti-apartheid civic group as an alternative government in <PERSON> Alexandra </PERSON>. The 39-year-old activist, whose release has been demanded by many international labor groups, testified about his impoverished childhood and experiences as an illegal migrant worker after he moved to the <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> area in the early 1970s. `` White people lived in civilized places, but next door in <LOCATION> Alexandra </LOCATION>, black people lived in a place where pigs would live,'' said <PERSON> Mayekiso </PERSON>, who will continue his testimony Wednesday. Once a squalid slum wedged amidst white <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> suburbs, <PERSON> Alexandra </PERSON> has been upgraded extensively by the government since <PERSON> Mayekiso </PERSON>'s arrest in June 1986. The trial has attracted international attention because of <PERSON> Mayekiso </PERSON>'s position as general secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Metalworkers </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and because many activists view the prosecution as an attempt to stifle legitimate, peaceful opposition activity. The government alleges that the defendants organized rent and consumer boycotts, sought to undermine the security forces, and established `` people's courts'' in 1985-86, the height of nationwide black unrest. <PERSON> Alexandra </PERSON> was one of the most militant black townships at the time, and dozens of people were killed in clashes with security forces. In the past two years, the government has sought to restore control by detaining or restricting leaders of <PERSON> Mayekiso </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Alexandra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> while undertaking a $ 45 million redevlopment program in which sewage, electricity and paved streets are being provided to most of the 100,000 residents. Many of the state witnesses who testified during the early stages of the treason trial were businessmen who said they suffered from boycotts enforced by the action committee. Under cross-examination, some of these witnesses said the local crime rate dropped when young supporters of the action committee began an anti-crime campaign. Another highly publicized court case reaches a critical stage Wednesday when lawyers for the <LOCATION> Sharpeville </LOCATION> Six appear before the Appeal Court to challenge the dismissal of a motion to reopen the murder trial of their black clients. The five men and one woman have been sentenced to hang for their roles in the 1984 mob killing of a black town councilor. There have been an extensive worldwide campaign appealing to President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> to grant clemency. In June, a lower court judge rejected a defense motion to reopen the trial to consider new evidence. At Wednesday's hearing in <LOCATION> Bloemfontein </LOCATION>, the defense lawyers will be asking the <ORGANIZATION> Appeal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> _ <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s highest court _ to allow a full appeal of the judge's decision.

<HEAD>Dissidents Demand Release Of Political Prisoners Before Olympics</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Dissident groups called Tuesday for the release of about 700 political prisoners before the Olympics and charged the Games were being used to enforce dictatorial rule. The 16 groups issued an appeal to the `` peace lovers'' of the 161 nations taking part in the Olympics to help obtain the release of all political prisoners before the Games begin Sept. 17. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Kun-tae </PERSON>, a top dissident, told a news conference attended by 80 other dissidents that the Olympics are being used to cement military rule. He charged the Games will be a mockery if any political prisoners remain behind bars. `` The <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> Olympics ... is not an event to pursue global peace but to forcibly reinforce the dictatorship and legitimize violence,'' the groups said in a joint statement. The South Korean government says all political prisoners have been released except for dissidents convicted of violent crimes or communism. Hundreds of political prisoners were freed over the past year. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON>, who was released from prison in June, said 370 people are serving sentences for opposing the government and more than 300 others are awaiting trial on political charges. The government says there about 250 dissidents serving criminal sentences or awaiting trial on such charges. The dissidents also denounced communist <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s exclusion from the Olympics and called for reunification of the divided <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> peninsula. They said the Games were being used to make the division permanent. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> has said it will boycott the Olympics because its demand to co-host the Games was turned down. The International Olympic Committee said the Games are awarded to a single city and could not be shared. The dissidents also charged the Olympics were being staged by the government of President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> Tae-woo to enhance its prestige and cement authoritarian rule. `` The dehumanizing torture and terror will not cease and at this very moment, under the euphemism of ` peace during the Olympics,' more people will be arrested,'' the groups said in a statement. They urged other nations to help them fight the government. `` We ask for your full-fledged support in our difficult fight for national sovereignty, democracy and reunification and resistance to <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>'s military dictatorial regime,'' the statement said. The dissidents also demanded withdrawal of the 42,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops based in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> under a mutual defense treaty. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>, a former general who won presidential elections in Decmeber, has introduced broad democratic reforms and dismantled authoritarian controls imposed by former President <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> <PERSON> Doo-hwan </PERSON>. Dissident groups contend the government is a front for continued authoritarian rule by the military and there has been no democratic progress. The dissidents and radical anti-government students have little or no public support and <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>'s popularity has been growing. Most Koreans want the Olympics to be a major success. The Games are seen as a way to propel the nation into the forefront of newly developed nations and continue its rapid industrial development. In another development, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> has temporarily halted foreign adoption of its babies to avoid possible controversy during the Olympics. The government has not officially confirmed the ban, but adoption agencies acknowledged they were asked to stop sending babies overseas for adoption for two months before and during the Olympics. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> sends about 7,000 children abroad annually for adoption in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 Firefighters, worried it would start `` raining fire'' today, hosed down houses and bolstered lines against blazes that have blackened nearly 1 million acres in and around Yellowstone National Park. County authorities declared a state of emergency today in <LOCATION> Cooke </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Silver </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gate </LOCATION>, just outside the park, and sheriff's deputies fanned out to order lingering townspeople to leave their homes. The declaration authorized the sheriff's office to forcibly remove anyone who did n't leave the threatened areas voluntarily. Southwesterly winds 20 to 30 mph were expected in the <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION> area after relatively light winds Monday. Strong winds also whipped a 160-acre fire in north-central <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> from 160 acres Monday to more than 20,000 acres today. Authorities had feared the changing winds could send embers and flames into the two small towns from the advancing 61,300-acre Storm Creek blaze. `` We have about a 25 percent chance of holding the fire out of these two communities,'' <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Liebersbach </PERSON>, incident commander in Silver Gate, said on <ORGANIZATION> NBC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Today'' show this morning. `` With these winds, it will be heroic, a real success to save some of these buildings,'' said fire information officer <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaunert </PERSON>. Elsewhere in <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION>, the 142,000-acre North Fork fire burned to within a few miles of the Old Faithful geyser, but authorities were optimistic the fire would not reach the tourist attraction. `` The fire's about four miles from Old Faithful. So if we do get those predicted winds we could have some problems there, but I think we have a good chance,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Barbee </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> superintendant, also appearing on `` Today.'' Thirteen fires in and around <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> have scorched 900,000 acres, and should top 1 million acres today after aerial surveys are completed, <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Cargill </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, said at a news conference in <LOCATION> Bozeman </LOCATION>. About 300,000 more acres could burn this week, he said. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, a fast-growing fire in the eastern Cascade hills destroyed one home and threatened others, said <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> <PERSON> Mickel </PERSON> of the state Department of Natural Resources. He said he did not know how many homes or how near they were to the fire. The fire, about six miles west of <LOCATION> Entiat </LOCATION>, was burning on steep hills covered with sage, grass, pine, and some <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> fir, and was beginning to butt up against some orchards in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s premier fruit-growing region, <PERSON> Mickel </PERSON> said. The fire was reported Sunday and pegged at 160 acres Monday morning. By 4:30 p.m. it grew to 500 acres. But when 20 mph westerly winds moved in, it accelerated rapidly to 3,000 acres by 7:30 p.m. and 20,000 by 4 a.m. today, <PERSON> Mickel </PERSON> said. That fire and others across the state prompted Gov. <PERSON> Booth </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON> to call out the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> late Monday, mainly to help transport firefighting crews to blazes in central and eastern <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. A 12,500-acre fire near the White Mountain Complex, about 75 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Spokane </LOCATION>, had been the state's largest fire. In <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, 13 forest fires raged out of control. A new fire broke out Monday seven miles north of <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, on the western edge of the massive North Fork fire that burned out of <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION> during the weekend, forcing an estimated 150-200 summer cabin owners to evacuate. In Silver Gate and <LOCATION> Cooke </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION>'s northeastern entrance, all but 30 of the approximately 150 residents had evacuated. `` Some of them are staying around because they want to see what the fire does,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Fry </PERSON>, an emergency services official. `` They're mostly packed up, though, and we're trying to push them out.'' Mild winds blew ash and smoke toward the towns Monday afternoon. Fire lines were completed Monday around Silver Gate and nearly completed around <LOCATION> Cooke </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, said fire information officer <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Consolo </PERSON>. About 75 trucks were called in from as far away as <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> to protect buildings in the communities. Firefighters also doused homes with water. Hopes of burning out fuels from a two-mile swath in the fire's path were dashed when backfires failed to burn as expected, leaving towns with less protection than officials had wanted <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> officials in northwest <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> also prepared an evacuation plan for homes in a residential area south of the tiny town of <LOCATION> Fortine </LOCATION>. `` Right now, we've got our fingers crossed that this wind is n't going to be that harsh,'' said spokesman <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Guth </PERSON>, stressing that residents would be asked to leave only if winds materialize The blaze jumped over some lines and grew to an estimated 12,300 acres. While the forecast for brisk winds worried officials at most fires in the region, it was welcomed at the 54,270-acre Hellroaring Creek fire burning in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Absaroka-Beartooth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wilderness </LOCATION> and south into <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION>. Spokesman <PERSON> Stephanie </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibert </PERSON> said the expected southwest winds would allow firefighters to set backfires that would burn into the main blaze. Elsewhere, a blaze that has charred more than 20,000 acres in <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ventura </LOCATION> counties continued to burn out of control today, but fire dispatcher <PERSON> Annie </PERSON> <PERSON> Ironside </PERSON> said containment was anticipated late this evening. Oregon's largest fire of the season was nearly contained at just under 57,000 acres in the rugged Hell's <ORGANIZATION> Canyon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Recreation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Area </ORGANIZATION>. In northern <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, fire officials said a fire burning near Paradise that was thought to be 250 acres was really only 5 acres. Heavy smoke was blamed for the error, said <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Tate </PERSON>, an Interagency Fire Center spokesman.

 Chinese officials on Tuesday asked <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> to press the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration to allow <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> satellites to be shipped to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and launched into space aboard its missiles. <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>, who is visiting <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> for the first time, met for more than three hours Tuesday with National Defense Minister <PERSON> Qin </PERSON> <PERSON> Jiwei </PERSON>. He also held talks with other officials, including Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> and Vice Premier <PERSON> Wu </PERSON> <PERSON> Xueqian </PERSON>. A Senior <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> also discussed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> concerns over Chinese arms sales to nations in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> _ a sore point in Sino-American relations. The <ORGANIZATION> Reagan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> is considering whether to grant licenses to export U.S.-made satellites to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, where they would be launched aboard the so-called Long March boosters. Two companies have applied for such export licenses _ <ORGANIZATION> Hughes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aircraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and Asiasat, a <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong-based </LOCATION> company that purchased <ORGANIZATION> Hughes </ORGANIZATION> satellites, according to <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neal </PERSON>, director of communications for the <ORGANIZATION> Hughes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Secundo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION> `` There are rumors -LRB- the launches from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> -RRB- may be as much as 50 percent cheaper'' than the <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> or American shuttle programs, <PERSON> O'Neal </PERSON> said on Tuesday. He said he could not speculate on the exact costs of Chinese launches. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> shuttle program was sidelined by the explosion aboard the Challenger in Jan. 28, 1986 in which all seven people aboard were killed. <PERSON> O'Neal </PERSON> said <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> is applying for a licence for two of telecommunications satellites bought by the Australian company <ORGANIZATION> Aussat </ORGANIZATION>. He said the satellites are owned by <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> until they are launched under a `` delivery in orbit'' contract with the Australian company, which has chosen <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> as the launch site. <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> has received no response to its license application, which was made in July, according to <PERSON> O'Neal </PERSON>. Asiasat owns a Hughes-made <ORGANIZATION> Westar </ORGANIZATION> 6 satellite that was launched by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> shuttle in 1984 but failed to reach its proper orbit. It was recovered by the shuttle in 1985, <PERSON> O'Neal </PERSON> said, will be refurbished in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Asiasat must have a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> license to export it to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> so it can be launched again. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> recommended the licenses be approved, but the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and some Republican congressmen say allowing <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> to launch <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> satellites will undercut <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies developing the same service. On the arms issue, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has strongly urged <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> to curtail sales of Silkworm anti-ship missiles to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and voiced concern over the recent sale of ballistic missiles to <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> denied selling arms to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. Deputy Chief of Staff <PERSON> Xu </PERSON> <PERSON> Xin </PERSON> told reporters Tuesday that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has not sold its M-9 medium range missiles to <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, as reported by foreign news agencies.

 A malfunction of a Soviet spacecraft's guidance system today forced two cosmonauts to delay their return to Earth for one day. A newspaper said their life support systems would last just two more days and food was running low. Aboard the Soyuz-TM 5 capsule were <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahad </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohmand </PERSON>, 29, the first Afghan in space, and Soviet crewmate <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyakhov </PERSON>, 47. They were returning from the orbiting space station Mir, where they spent six days. The government daily <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency said life support systems aboard the capsule are designed to last two days. However, a Soviet space official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the cosmonauts could stretch supplies of oxygen, water and food for up to a week. He did not explain how the oxygen supply could be stretched out. <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> reported this exchange between mission control and the cosmonauts: `` How are things with food?'' a mission controller asked. `` There is no food,'' said <PERSON> Lyakhov </PERSON>. `` But in the accident reserves?'' the controller asked. `` There is some, but why touch it? We will endure,'' said <PERSON> Lyakhov </PERSON>. The problems began shortly after the Soyuz capsule disengaged from the orbiting station Mir at 2:55 a.m. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> time, <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported. The capsule had brought <PERSON> Lyakhov </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Mohmand </LOCATION> and Soviet doctor <PERSON> Valery </PERSON> <PERSON> Polyakov </PERSON> to the Mir on Aug. 31. <PERSON> Polyakov </PERSON> stayed aboard the Mir to monitor the health of two other cosmonauts, who have been in space for more than eight months. An engine used to slow the Soyuz for re-entry through the Earth's atmosphere fired automatically while the vehicle was out of radio contact with ground controllers, <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> said. When contact was restored, <PERSON> Lyakhov </PERSON> reported: `` Accident! The engine worked 60 seconds and shut off. A violation of the stabilization regime.'' Controllers decided to delay another re-entry attempt for three hours, and in the meantime scientists discovered that an infrared guidance system had malfunctioned and a computer automatically terminated the engine burn prematurely, <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> said. The burn was supposed to have lasted 230 seconds. Seven minutes later, the guidance system was activated automatically again and started the engine, but would have put the capsule on a trajectory for a landing in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, instead of its intended destination, the Soviet Central Asian republic of <LOCATION> Kazakhstan </LOCATION>, the newspaper said. The cosmonauts manually cut off the engine burn after three seconds. `` We will postpone the landing until tomorrow,'' mission chief <PERSON> Valery </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryumin </PERSON>, himself a cosmonaut, told <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION>. `` Do n't worry, nothing terrible has happened yet. The life support system will last for two days.'' Radio <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> said the Soyuz cosmonauts `` are feeling well and there is reliable communication between the aircraft and mission control.'' It said the landing was postponed so as `` not to take risks'' and to allow time for a new re-entry trajectory to be programmed into the capsule's computer. The <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> reports did not say whether it was possible <LOCATION> Mohmand </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Lyakhov </PERSON> could return to Mir if they are unable to get guidance systems to work properly. Aboard Mir, <PERSON> Polyakov </PERSON> was monitoring the health of cosmonauts <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Titov </PERSON> and <PERSON> Musa </PERSON> <PERSON> Manarov </PERSON>, who are trying to break a 326-day endurance record set by <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Romanenko </PERSON>. They have been in space since last Dec. 21. <PERSON> Lyakhov </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Mohmand </LOCATION> helped <PERSON> Titov </PERSON> and <PERSON> Manarov </PERSON> conduct medical, geological and other experiments during their six-day stay on the research station.

While police awaited their crisis negotiator, the <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> inflated an air bag and moved it into place on the southbound lanes of the freeway. When <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON> then threatened to set his shirt on fire, officers pushed him off the bridge, <PERSON> Lutz </PERSON> said. `` We assisted him. We pushed him out the bridge onto the airbag to prevent him from setting his shirt on fire. He was not injured,'' <PERSON> Lutz </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON> was taken to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> County-USC Medical Center for observation. The incident created a huge traffic jam during the morning rush hour, backing up the freeway in both directions until about 6:20 a.m., <PERSON> McDonald </PERSON> said. A check of <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON>'s background revealed he had attempted to jump from a <LOCATION> Glendale </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Freeway </LOCATION> overpass last month, <PERSON> Lutz </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Glendale </LOCATION> police Sgt. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Fishback </PERSON> said <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON> was on the Holly Drive overpass for 2 -LCB- hours Aug. 24 before being rescued.

<HEAD>Relic Of 1968 Campus Violence Finally To Be Rehabilitated</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 More than 20 years after <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> began building a gymnasium, a project abandoned after violent demonstrations rocked the campus in 1968, the empty foundation hole will be turned into a park pond. Stopping construction of the gym was one of the aims of the uprising, in which university buildings were taken over by campus radicals who called the project racist. Others complained it took away part of <LOCATION> Morningside </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Parks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> plans to put $ 12 million into rehabilitating the park in the next 10 years. <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> is contributing $ 500,000 to the project, said spokesman <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Knubel </PERSON>. The now-overgrown hole will become a pond, said Parks Commissioner <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Stern </PERSON>. While opposition to the Vietnam War and mistrust of institutions in general also fueled the campus revolt, protesters called the gym a perfect example of racism practiced by white, elite <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> against its neighbors in poor, black <LOCATION> Harlem </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> designed the $ 12 million gym to be shared with the black community, saying it would not only provide recreation but also bring law-abiding residents back to a park taken over by muggers. The protesters, however, harped on the two entrances planned for the gym _ one for students on the <LOCATION> Morningside </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heights </LOCATION> campus atop the park's scarp, the other for the community at the building's base in the valley below <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION>'s argument that the lower entrance would spare users a long, steep climb through the park was largely overwhelmed by the symbolism of upper and lower entrances. Other opposition came from conservationists, who objected to the gym taking away two acres in the central section of the 31-acre park. The issue of whether it is safe to use the park remains. Another institution bordering Morningside, the Cathedral of <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> the Divine, organized a `` reclaim-the-park'' program Saturday. It consisted of a march and music and art programs to get people back into the park and `` push the pushers out.'' <PERSON> Stern </PERSON> called it a good idea, but said the park was lightly used because `` mostly it's a slope and it needs rehabilitation.'' He said ball fields in the flat areas would be fixed up, new lighting installed and a new path cut with `` shorter steps that will make it easier, simpler and safer to go up and across the park.''

 Former <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> received a two-day extension today on a deadline to produce a $ 3 million line of credit supporting his bid to regain control of the television ministry and religious theme park. At a news conference this afternoon outside the <LOCATION> Heritage </LOCATION> <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION> park offices, bankruptcy court trustee M.C. `` Red'' <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> said he gave <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> until Thursday to prove he has the money to regain the empire he lost in a sex-and-money scandal. <PERSON> Benton </PERSON>, who had set today as the deadline, said the reason for the delay was that attorneys were still working out final details of the contract for <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> to buy <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> said he was convinced that <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> had the $ 3 million but said the contract would not be completed until Wednesday at the earliest. A jubilant <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> told reporters he expected to have the $ 3 million by the end of the day. <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s total bid now is $ 172 million, up from the $ 165 million that had been reported, and that <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> needs to present him with a bonafide plan for $ 74 million of the financing by Friday. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s bid is scheduled to be presented to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Bankruptcy Judge <PERSON> Rufus </PERSON> <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> on Saturday. <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> said he would not rule out the possibility that other offers also would be presented to the judge. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> said he has $ 2.9 million in cash and pledges already, and expects to top $ 3 million by the end of the day. `` It looks like it's all going to be there,'' <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> said earlier today about the $ 3 million line of credit. Meeting with reporters at the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Outreach </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> executive offices of <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>, he acknowledged he did not have the entire amount yet, saying, `` We might be $ 100,000 or $ 200,000 short.'' Asked when he expected to have it all, he said, `` By midnight tonight.'' <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> said he spent the morning at the <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON> Ministries office answering telephones. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> and his attorney, <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Toms </PERSON>, said Monday they were certain supporters will donate the money needed to satisfy <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> bankruptcy trustee M.C. `` Red'' <PERSON> Benton </PERSON>. `` To come up with $ 3 million in a holiday weekend I had to pray and say, ` God help me,''' <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> said. `` We are sort of running our own Labor Day telethon without a television station,'' he said. `` I'm not going to leave any stone unturned. I'm not going to stumble now.'' <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> said a group of people was working on raising the remaining $ 1 million in $ 1,000 pledges and he has set up a trust account at a <LOCATION> Hendersonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, bank to accept donations. Those donations would be used only if he and his wife, <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON> <PERSON> Faye </PERSON>, succeeded in purchasing the ministry, he said. <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> asked for the money as a sign of <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s ability to follow through on his offer for the <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> theme park, a satellite TV network and undeveloped property near the Fort Mill ministry. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> leads the bidding for the assets of the ministry that went into bankruptcy protection soon after he left in March 1987. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> stepped down after admitting to a sexual encounter with church secretary <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON> <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> and after the ministry paid her hush money.

 Republican presidential nominee <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told a group of jeering shipyard workers today that `` the Democrats are trying to mislead you'' and promised that if he is elected he would provide more jobs for Americans. `` Listen to this one now,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told a group of about 250 workers who booed loudly as the vice president spoke at an iron works. `` I know the truth sometimes hurts.'' The crowd chanted, `` Union Buster,'' but <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> contined to speak in a loud voice, telling the workers, `` The Democrats are trying to mislead you. Things are n't going to get worse unless they get elected.'' It was the most hostile audience the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nominee has encountered since winning the nomination last month. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> conceded that <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> is a state where he is trailing Democratic rival <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. Speaking with reporters aboard <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> II en route from <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> accused <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> of waging a negative campaign. `` He has to tear down. He has to make everything negative to be elected. I do n't have to be responding to him,'' the vice president said. At the <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> shipyard, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> toured a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> oil refueling boat and then spoke to a group of iron workers alongside the ship, stressing the jobs theme and his claim that the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has helped to create more than 17 million new jobs Many of the hard-hat workers carried anti-Bush signs that accused him of being anti-union, including one that said, `` Union Busting, Scab-Loving <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>.'' Although <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was booed and hooted during his speech, he did win a few cheers from the audience when he told the group, `` I'm proud to be part of an administration ... that decided we're not going to wear the ` kick me' signs anymore.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he thought the election was going to be `` a referendum on the direction of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s future'' and said that his single most important goal was `` that everybody who wants a job should have a job ... a good job at good wages, he -LRB- <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> -RRB- may talk about it but we delivered it.'' He was to tour another plant in <LOCATION> Everett </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>. On a related matter, a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spokeswoman said campaign chairmen for the two presidential candidates spoke this morning by telephone and made `` some progress'' on a debate schedule <PERSON> Alixe </PERSON> <PERSON> Glen </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign chairman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Brountas </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> chairman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> will resume negotiations by phone on Wednesday on dates and a format for the presidential debates. The Republican presidential nominee, at a Labor Day waterfront rally in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>, accused <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> of a `` negative ideology against weapons.'' And, he said at the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> base town, `` I would n't be surprised if he thinks a naval exercise is something you find in ` The Jane Fonda Workout Book.''' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> audience that the two central issues of the campaign were `` jobs and peace ... and how to make new breakthroughs in both areas.'' Recent public opinion polls suggest <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is three to seven points behind <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, which has 47 electoral votes. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is also viewed as stronger in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, and, to a lesser degree, in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> aides say polling done by the campaign is becoming increasingly pivotal in determining the vice president's campaign schedule. Many surveys suggest that the race, nationwide, is close to a dead heat.

<HEAD>Salt-Filled Warehouse Has Become Haven for Homeless Boys, Paper
Reports</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The city will clear out homeless youths living in a rat-infested salt warehouse and try to direct them to more appropriate facilities, a Sanitation Department official said Tuesday. `` We have had problems in the past keeping both homeless and runaways from our facilities,'' said <PERSON> Vito </PERSON> <PERSON> Turso </PERSON>, chief spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Sanitation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. `` We chase them out. They come back. We chase them out again. They come back again.'' <PERSON> Turso </PERSON>'s remarks came after the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported Tuesday that dozens of homeless boys, some of whom work as prostitutes, lived in the salt-filled warehouse and in an adjacent row of broken-down garbage trucks in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>. This time, <PERSON> Turso </PERSON> said, sanitation workers will be issued cards with the telephone number of a runaway hot line to hand out. `` I guess the answer to the problem is not to keep chasing them out to nowhere but to chase them out to somewhere they can get help,'' he said. Atop a garbage-strewn mountain of salt, which is used on city streets in the winter, is a shantytown of mattresses and crates, where the boys cook, eat, sleep and play, the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said. The newspaper said some youths stay for weeks or months. <PERSON> Turso </PERSON> maintained that the <ORGANIZATION> Sanitation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> chases away the youths and clears out their mattresses whenever a new load of salt is delivered, most recently three weeks ago. The newspaper reported that the youths walked in and out of the rat-infested warehouse in plain view of sanitation workers. Said <PERSON> Turso </PERSON>: `` The sanitation workers' job at that location is to report and then to go out on assignment. It's not to be a security officer.'' Asked about the Department's police force, he said it did not have patrols regularly assigned to the warehouse. But on the basis of the report, <PERSON> Turso </PERSON> said, `` We've asked the supervisor to take a look ... to see if there are people there and to encourage them to leave.'' Outreach groups estimate that 20,000 young people roam the streets every year, and 80 percent to 90 percent of them live by prostitution, the paper said.

 A rare <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> mastiff bat, the first one seen in the state in a decade, was found near death on an office balcony but has recovered and escaped to the wild, a biologist said. Wildlife biologist <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazzotti </PERSON> said, however, the offspring the round-eared brown bat bore on Labor Day died at birth. `` I do n't think the death of the -LRB- baby bat -RRB- changes the significance of what has happened,'' <PERSON> Mazzotti </PERSON> said. `` Not only is the bat still in south <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, but you have a reproductive population.'' <PERSON> Mazzotti </PERSON> and fellow bat hunter <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Robson </PERSON> had been scouring <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> since June trying to determine if the species still survived in the state. They had alerted residents to watch out for the bat.

The worker took it inside and gave it the nickname of <LOCATION> P.L. </LOCATION>, which she declined to explain. She called a veterinarian, who took the bat. A routine X-ray Friday found the bat was pregnant. The bat was in shock and dehydrated, her blood sugar and body temperature extremely low. P.L. gave birth to a stillborn baby bat at the home of the veterinarian who was nursing her back to health, <PERSON> Mazzotti </PERSON> said. The previously silent P.L. _ who was scheduled to be released Monday _ became vocal and active after the birth, and soon wiggled out of her cage to freedom. `` We can only hope she's OK out there somewhere,'' <PERSON> Robson </PERSON> said.

 <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> Zoo officials are giving giant panda <LOCATION> Chia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chia </LOCATION> five days off to see if he can overcome what they believe is homesickness. <PERSON> Chia </PERSON> <PERSON> Chia </PERSON> went on display Friday at the start of a three-month stopover on his move from the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> Zoo to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. But the zoo administrators closed the exhibit the same day because the panda was staying in his den and acting strangely. `` At first, we thought it was jet lag, but it's taken much longer than we expected,'' said <PERSON> Jo </PERSON> <PERSON> Gipps </PERSON>, curator of mammals with the <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zoo </ORGANIZATION>, who traveled with <PERSON> Chia </PERSON> <PERSON> Chia </PERSON>. `` Homesick is exactly the word for what's wrong.'' Since Friday, the 290-pound panda has emerged periodically from his den to eat bamboo for a few minutes, then quickly retreated from public view. When keepers tried to lock the doors to his den to keep him in view, the panda became agitated, pacing rapidly and bumping the walls. `` He's normally quite extroverted. That's why we're concerned,'' said <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Bemment </PERSON>, the panda's keeper. `` Animals are unpredictable. We're not going to push him,'' said <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Maruska </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Cincinnati </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zoo </ORGANIZATION>. He and officials from the <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zoo </ORGANIZATION> decided <PERSON> Chia </PERSON> <PERSON> Chia </PERSON> needed time alone in his new surroundings. Zoo officials will meet Thursday to decide if the exhibit can reopen Friday. Zookeepers built a platform for the panda Monday to make him feel like he is at his old <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zoo </ORGANIZATION> home, <ORGANIZATION> Cincinnati </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zoo </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> said. `` He's getting better. He's looking a little better _ just a little lonely,'' Ms. <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> said Tuesday. The delay means about 3,400 people with tickets to see <LOCATION> Chia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chia </LOCATION> this week will have to exchange their tickets or get refunds. Through Sunday afternoon, 81,000 people had bought tickets to see the panda before he leaves Nov. 30. The 16-year-old panda, captured in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> at the age of 2, arrived in <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> on Friday after a seven-hour road trip from <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, following a 10-hour flight from <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Chia </PERSON> <PERSON> Chia </PERSON> is scheduled to become a permanent resident of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Chapultepec </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zoo </LOCATION>, where it is hoped he will breed.

<HEAD>Regulators Warn Consumers Against Costly Gold Swindles</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Thousands of American investors will lose millions of dollars this year in what authorities on Tuesday branded the `` fool's gold rush of 1988'' _ various swindles offering the chance to buy gold at below-market prices. State securities regulators and the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Better </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureaus </ORGANIZATION> warned in an `` investor alert'' that the gold schemes represented the fastest growing fraud threat in the country. Since the spring of 1987, they said, the number of known gold scams has jumped from eight to 52 under investigation currently. Officials said last October's stock market collapse had created a climate allowing the swindles to proliferate. `` Thousands of individuals fled the markets, turning their backs on mainstream investments,'' <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Tennessee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Division </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>, told a news conference. `` The result: a huge pool of potential, cash-rich victims ripe for exploitation by the promoters of exotic investment swindles.'' <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON>, who is president of the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administrators </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> representing 50 state securities offices, estimated that tens of thousands of <LOCATION> Americans </LOCATION> nationwide would lose $ 250 million in the bogus gold deals this year. The typical `` dirt pile'' swindle works this way: A high-pressure salesman calls from a boiler-room telephone operation, offering to sell 100 tons of dirt for $ 5,000. The con artist guarantees that the dirt pile will yield at least 20 ounces of gold, an effective price of $ 250 an ounce, far cheaper than the current spot market gold price of $ 430 an ounce. `` The problem is the gold does n't exist beyond microscopic, economically unrecoverable levels,'' <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON> said. He said investigators have found that many of the mine sites contain less gold than can be found in sea water. `` The mine is nothing more than a Godforsaken patch of desert scrubland,'' he said. `` These deals are a rip-off from the word go.'' <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> McIlhenny </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Better </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureaus </ORGANIZATION>, said virtually all the swindlers operated by telephone, calling people in other states, thus avoiding detection by local authorities. `` These swindlers are skilled. They sweet talk you, they guarantee you big profits in a short time,'' he said. `` Their victims are from all stations of life from unsophisticated elderly persons to professionals who think they understand the risks of investing.'' In one case, officials said 2,000 investors were bilked out of $ 20 million by a former <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> furniture salesman selling off a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> mine site which he claimed would generate almost $ 100 million in gold sales per year. The salesman was convicted last month in a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> court of 12 felony counts. In another case, investigators said that a <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> inmate already jailed on a fraud charge used prison telephones to persuade investors in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> to pay an average of $ 6,250 each for worthless dirt in an inactive <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> mine. When he was caught the second time, prison authorities moved him to solitary confinement. `` Why people will commit their life savings over the phone, when they would n't think of buying a car or house sight unseen, is a continuing and troubling mystery to those of us whose job it is to promote investor protection,'' <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON> said. Officials urged consumers to hang up on high-pressure telephone sales tactics. They said investors also should not be swayed by official-looking mineral-content analyses, known as assays, because even legitimate testing labs can be duped by a dirt sample that has been `` salted'' or taken from a different mine site. They also said investors should beware of vague promises on when the gold will be delivered. The `` dirt pile'' con artists normally say delivery will take from one to three years, long enough for the swindler to fleece the maximum number of investors possible and then move on to a new type of investment fraud.

<TEXT>
 South American governments have begun to act decisively to curb narcotics trafficking, but Andean coca production continues to grow, as reflected by a bumper crop this year, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported Tuesday. The department's mid-year update on the administration's international narcotics control strategy said the January-June period was characterized by a mix of progress and some frustration On the negative side, the report said there has been `` a lack of progress in reducing the steadily growing Andean coca crop.'' But the report praised the <LOCATION> Bolivian </LOCATION> government for exceeding its eradication targets and <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> for its commitment to test herbicides for use against coca. <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> also was praised for its decision to use military forces against drug traffickers. The report said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> program to reduce coca production by 50 per cent in five years is working. The strategy calls for a program of eradication, enforcement, development assistance, public diplomacy and international cooperation. `` During the past six months, recognition by <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> governments of the urgent need to address the Andean coca problem has grown significantly,'' the report said. `` Not only is concern addressed in leaders' public statements, but Latin American governments have begun to act, and act decisively. With <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> experts predicting our nation's cocaine use levels may have peaked, there is genuine concern in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and elsewhere about where new cocaine markets will open as traffickers seek outlets for the Andes' bumber crop.'' The report said Andean governments are taking steps on their own to deal with their narcotics challenges. `` While the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> continues to play a major role in assisting <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> in eradication and enforcement, these nations have launched important suppression operations separately and together,'' the report said. It noted that Latin American enforcement organizations, operating together this summer, made 1,200 arrests and seized a substantial amount of illicit drugs, proving that regional approaches to drug enforcement are more effective than single country approaches.

 An explosion that may have been caused by a welder's torch ripped through a Greek oil tanker on Tuesday, splitting the vessel in half and leaving seven people dead and 16 injured, officials said. In addition to the ship's 28-member crew, about 25 workers were on board the green-and-white vessel for cleaning and maintenance work, officials said. Many of those injured suffered severe burns. The force of the explosion also shattered windows in stores and offices around <LOCATION> Perama </LOCATION>. Harbor authorities in the industrial port 10 miles west of <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> ruled out the possibility of a terrorist attack. Instead, they theorized the explosion on board the 86,000-ton Anangel Greatness may have been caused by gas fumes left in the vessel's empty tanks. Investigators speculate welders working on the ship during routine maintenance and cleaning may have ignited the 10:15 a.m. blast. The explosion came less than two months after <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> terrorists launched a gun-and-grenade attack aboard the City of <LOCATION> Poros </LOCATION> cruise ship as it returned from a one-day Greek island hopping tour. Nine people were killed and more than 80 others were injured in that assault. `` We felt a series of sudden blinding explosions that threw us to different parts of the ship,'' said <PERSON> Evangelos </PERSON> <PERSON> Polychronakis </PERSON>, 38, who was working aboard the tanker at the time of the blast. `` As the deck blew up, large chunks of metal went hurtling into the air. I tried to get out from inside one of the tanks I was working in and then jumped into the sea,'' he said. `` When the explosion occurred I was at the bottom of one of the tanks,'' said <PERSON> Andreas </PERSON> <PERSON> Varisis </PERSON>, 27. `` Sea water gushed into the ship as it ripped apart and I rose with it inside the tank, trying deperately to find some way out.'' The skipper of the Anangel, Capt. <PERSON> Anastasios </PERSON> <PERSON> Theocharis </PERSON>, said the vessel had been certified free of gas before it sailed into <PERSON> Perama </PERSON> for repairs Monday. <ORGANIZATION> Merchant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> officials said the ship carried documents showing all gas had been removed. `` I was in the control room at the stern when I heard a tremendous noise and everything clattered to the deck,'' <PERSON> Theocharis </PERSON> said. Harbor authorities identified two of the dead as Theodosis Vorisis and <PERSON> Aristides </PERSON> <PERSON> Daskalakis </PERSON>. Fragments of what appeared to be five other bodies were also found, said a <LOCATION> Perama </LOCATION> police officer who demanded anonymity. `` People were tossed all over the place. There were dismembered bodies landing on the deck of another tanker berthed next to this one,'' said <PERSON> Costas </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakaros </PERSON>, a metalworkers' union official. The force of the explosion also shattered windows in stores and offices around <LOCATION> Perama </LOCATION>.

 A high school science teacher with a mock Space Lab in his classroom to help students learn about space travel has been selected winner of the third <PERSON> Christa </PERSON> <PERSON> McAuliffe </PERSON> Award for Aerospace Education. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Barainca </PERSON>, a teacher at <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Brighton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, will be presented the award by the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> on Sept. 19 in <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va </LOCATION>. The award is named for <PERSON> Christa </PERSON> <PERSON> McAuliffe </PERSON>, the teacher killed in the 1986 Challenger disaster. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> selected Barainca, a teacher for 16 years, from more than 1,000 national candidates. He was to be honored locally at a dinner Tuesday night. <PERSON> Barainca </PERSON> was one of two <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> teachers selected as the state's candidates for <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s Teacher in Space program _ the program that ultimately selected <PERSON> McAuliffe </PERSON> for the ill-fated space shuttle launch in which she and six astronauts died on Jan. 28, 1986 At 52, <PERSON> Barainca </PERSON> said he sees his own chances of space travel waning, but `` I may get into space through these kids.'' To illustrate his lessons, he uses a Star Lab to dramatize life in space. Students shut themselves inside the mock spacecraft that occupies one corner of the classroom and spend up to five days there re-enacting a space mission. `` He teaches in a way that is off the path of other teachers. It's off the path of textbooks and into actual experience,'' said <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Fesler </PERSON>, one of <PERSON> Barainca </PERSON>'s students. The award's previous winners were a high school teacher from <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wayne </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, and an elementary school teacher from <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, Ore.

 <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> received his badge and commission Tuesday as the first black Texas Ranger, an achievement he had dreamed of since he was a boy. Young, 41, said his becoming the first black Ranger in the group's 165-year history `` should serve as an indication to other minorities and other people you can have any type of dream ... and it can become possible for you one day.'' Young spoke at a news conference after the ceremony conducted by Col. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Milner </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION>. Young, a 14-year veteran of the department, was most recently stationed in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION> as an investigator with the criminal intelligence service. He will be stationed in <LOCATION> Garland </LOCATION> as a Ranger. `` I, as a young boy growing up in <LOCATION> Southwest </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, read about the <ORGANIZATION> Rangers </ORGANIZATION> and saw movies and things of that type, and decided I would like to aspire to become a Ranger one day myself,'' said <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, who was born in <LOCATION> Del </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION>. Young was among 37 people receiving promotions in the ceremony at the safety department headquarters. His wife, <PERSON> Mary </PERSON>; children, <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kristen </PERSON>; and other family members watched him receive his badge. A Department of Public Safety officer must have at least eight years of law enforcement experience to be eligible to be a Ranger, and at least 60 hours of college or the equivalent education. Appointments are made on the basis of a competitive examination and oral interviews. Rangers are charged specifically with four duties: protection of life and property by enforcing state criminal statutes; suppressing riots and insurrections; investigating major crimes; and apprehending fugitives. The safety department has been hit by charges of racial discrimination in recent years. A black state trooper from <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> voiced disappointment last year when he was not selected for the <ORGANIZATION> Rangers </ORGANIZATION>. And the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advancement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colored </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> has charged that black officers have been discriminated against. Asked whether he believes there is racism in the agency, <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said, `` That's part of our society, and of course we try to do away with it, but it's part of our society and we have to learn to contend with that.''

 <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> will no longer be the only state in the nation to prohibit the sale of non-prescription magnifying eyeglasses under a bill Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> signed into law Tuesday. Sponsors said the measure will slash the cost of glasses for reading or magnifying objects at close range. Lobbying on the bill, which takes effect in 90 days, had been intense in the Legislature, with consumer groups and eyeglass manufacturers pushing for its approval and some state optometrists and opticians advocating its defeat. Both houses of the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> approved it last month. Obtaining magnifying eyeglasses with a prescription costs $ 60 to $ 120, according to the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Retired </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Persons </ORGANIZATION>. Buying them without a doctor's involvement cuts the price to $ 12 to $ 15, said the sponsors, state Sen. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Bruno </PERSON> and Assemblyman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gottfried </PERSON>. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> became the last state in the country to prohibit over-the-counter sales of the glasses in June, when <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> DiPrete </PERSON> legalized sales in his state. `` This clearly shows the absurdity of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s position and why it should change,'' said <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> <PERSON> Getman </PERSON>, a lobbyist on behalf of the nation's largest manufacturer of magnifying glasses, Magnivision of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. `` It's now 49 to 1.'' <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state's <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> opposed the measure for years but this year said it would go along with the bill after it was amended to require that all reading glasses carry a tag advising people to get their eyes checked regularly. <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Dorman </PERSON>, executive director of the Albany-based state <ORGANIZATION> Optometric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said approval of the bill would represent `` bad public health policy.'' <PERSON> Dorman </PERSON> said magnifying glasses can mask serious medical conditions including glaucoma and detached retinas, problems that health care professionals are trained to detect.

<HEAD>Judge Allows Evidence of Prior Near-Drowning in Court-Martial</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Testimony about a near-drowning last year involving a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> swimming instructor will be allowed in the instructor's court-martial for his role in the death of a recruit in March, a judge ruled Tuesday. Petty Officer 2nd Class <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Combe </PERSON>, 28, of <LOCATION> Tempe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, is charged with involuntary manslaughter, battery and conspiracy to commit battery in the March 2 drowing of Airman Recruit <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON>, 19, of <LOCATION> Appleton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Combe </PERSON> is accused of holding <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON>'s head under water after <ORGANIZATION> Pensacola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Station </ORGANIZATION> instructors forced the panic-stricken recruit back into a swimming pool when he climbed out and shouted he wanted to quit the voluntary training Opening arguments in the court-martial were scheduled to begin later Tuesday. In pre-trial motions, the military judge, Cmdr. <PERSON> Newell </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Krogmann </PERSON>, rejected a defense motion to bar testimony and prohibit the introduction of an accident report about the Sept. 30 near-drowning of <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Coccitti </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> reservist from <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Coccitti </PERSON> testified last week in the court-martial of the former officer in charge of the swimming school that he blacked out under water while <PERSON> Combe </PERSON> had him in a head hold. <PERSON> Coccitti </PERSON> had been participating in the `` sharks and daisies'' drill, the same exercise being conducted when <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON> died. An attorney for <PERSON> Combe </PERSON>, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Heath </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, argued that <PERSON> Coccitti </PERSON>'s testimony was irrelevant because the earlier emergency was unrelated to <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON>'s death The lead prosecutor, Lt. Cmdr. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Wynne </PERSON>, contended the information is pertinent because it showed <PERSON> Combe </PERSON> had a `` cavalier attitude'' toward students who passed out in the swimming pool. It was an occurrence known as `` smurfing'' because the skin of victims would turn blue like that of `` Smurf'' cartoon characters, former students have said. <PERSON> Mirecki </PERSON>, who had a phobia about being dragged under water, drowned after suffering a fear-induced heart attack, a pathologist testified last week in the court-martial of Lt. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Torchia </PERSON>, former officer in charge of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rescue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Swimmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Torchia </PERSON>, 32, of <LOCATION> Princeton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, was acquitted Thursday on both of two dereliction-of-duty charges. He is not scheduled to testify in <PERSON> Combe </PERSON>'s court-martial, but four other instructors who received non-judicial punishment are listed as defense witnesses. The prosecution granted them immunity after defense lawyers said their testimony was vital to <PERSON> Combe </PERSON>'s case.

<HEAD>Forest Service May Raid Replanting Fund To Pay For Firefighting</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 With the western forest fire season just entering its peak month, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> has already spent $ 190 million battling this summer's blazes and may be forced again to raid a key reforestation trust fund to pay for the effort. The agency tapped the same account to help pay last year's firefighting costs While <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> traditionally has bailed out the <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, an <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> lawmaker said Tuesday the `` smoke and mirrors'' budgeting could eventually jeopardize the replanting of national forest lands that have been logged. `` It's time the <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> rises above the politics of the Office of Management and the Budget in trying to create the illusion that the deficit is being held down,'' said Democratic Rep. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> DeFazio </PERSON>. <PERSON> DeFazio </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> has known for six months that western forest were tinder dry, but continued to use a `` short-sighted'' budget approach that requires <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to step in and appropriate additional funds. `` They continue to budget in a penny-wise and pound-foolish way,'' said <PERSON> DeFazio </PERSON>. A <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> budget official said no decision has yet been made on whether to borrow from the so-called Knutsen-Vanderberg trust fund. `` It's a possibility,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON>, an assistant director of the agency. Money from the fund comes from fees timber operators pay when they log national forests and is earmarked for reforestation projects. Traditionally, the <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>'s budget request includes a `` token'' amount for fighting fires. The agency will borrow from a trust fund if more money is needed and then ask <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for additional funding to repay what was borrowed. An interior appropriations bill pending in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> includes $ 125 million for firefighting and <PERSON> DeFazio </PERSON> said that most of it will be used to repay the trust fund from last year's borrowings. `` This whole things is incredibly frustrating,'' said <PERSON> DeFazio </PERSON>. `` They -LRB- the <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- admit it's not in their best interest, but they keep doing it.'' Last year, the <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> spent $ 265 million to fight fires that swept across about 800,000 acres in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. Most of those blazes were in late August and September.

 Republican vice presidential nominee <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> says Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is no different from previous <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> leaders and his system of reforms, known as `` perestroika,'' is `` nothing more than refined Stalinism.'' The <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> senator, in an interview published Tuesday in <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is `` new ... he has a different approach to things, and his mannerisms and style are unfortunately pleasing to the West. ... unfortunately because I do n't think, from an ideological point of view, he's any different from -LRB- <LOCATION> Leonid </LOCATION> -RRB- <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> or anybody else.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said perestroika is `` nothing more than refined Stalinism. Kick their people out and bring your people in. That's his reorganizing It's not changing the system.'' GOP presidential nominee <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said last month that he was pleased with changes in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, but he cautioned against complacency, saying, `` We'd better not let our guard down.'' Earlier this summer, the vice president had called the Soviet reforms `` revolutionary,'' but also said `` the cold war is not over.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> described Soviet efforts toward `` glasnost,'' or openness, as `` something different'' that might prove to be a positive sign, similar to the signing of the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> last December. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said the true test would be the Soviet leader's dealings with dissent in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, especially current problems in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. `` The bottom line is that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> wants trade and credits from the West ... to help his economy out, and we should not give it to him in a casual, easy way,'' he said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said this summer that some reforms proposed by <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> `` would truly, if implemented, be revolutionary and should the reforms ... be put into practice it would represent historic change.'' But <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> added, `` We've got to remember that the cold war is not over. We must be bold enough to seize the opportunity of change, but at the same time, as one pundit titled his column, be prepared for ` the protracted conflict.'''

 Catholic Archbishop <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pilarczyk </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> returned to work Tuesday for the first time since he suffered a ruptured brain artery in July. <PERSON> Pilarczyk </PERSON>, 54, who has governed the Archdiocese of <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> since 1982, spent a half day in his office, said the Rev. <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Kosse </PERSON>, spokesman for the archdiocese. It was his first day of official duty since he suffered the aneurysm July 23 while vacationing in <LOCATION> Gatlinburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn </LOCATION>. The archbishop underwent surgery July 25 at <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Good </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Samaritan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, where neurosurgeons sealed the ruptured artery and rerouted the brain's blood supply to avoid a possible fatal recurrence. He was released from the hospital Aug. 11. An aneurysm is a sac formed in the wall of an artery and is blamed on a congenital weakness in the arterial wall. <PERSON> Pilarczyk </PERSON> refused interviews Tuesday, but is to hold a news conference Thursday. His doctors said <PERSON> Pilarczyk </PERSON> gave them approval to be the first in <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> to use an experimental drug, which doctors said may have helped save his life by possibly preventing arterial spasms that can occur even after surgery. The drug, called nicardipine, relaxes the arterial wall and prevents spasms, doctors said. <PERSON> Pilarczyk </PERSON> is spiritual leader of about 550,000 Catholics in the 19-county archdiocese in southwestern <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. Auxiliary Bishop <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Garland </PERSON> governed the archdiocese during <PERSON> Pilarczyk </PERSON>'s absence.

<HEAD>Some Students Not Benefitting From Spread of Schoolroom Computers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Computers are moving rapidly into American classrooms, but too many minority and limited-English students are n't reaping the benefits of the new educational technology, an advisory group said in a report released Tuesday. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> schools have acquired nearly 2 million computers during this decade, said the report by the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assessment </ORGANIZATION>, a non-partisan agency that advises <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on technological matters. Whereas fewer than one school in five had a computer in 1981, now all but 5 percent of schools have at least one, the agency said in a 246-page report titled `` Power On! New Tools For Teaching and Learning.'' `` It has been a very important, useful investment,'' said report director <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>. `` When students are using computers, teachers are trained and the software is appropriate, there really are advances in learning.'' On the downside, the report found that the total number of computers is equal to one for every 30 students; average access is one hour a week, and it would cost $ 4 billion to reduce the student-computer ratio to 3:1. `` In general, classrooms today resemble their ancestors of 50 and 100 years ago much more closely than than they do today's assembly plants, scientific laboratories and operating rooms,'' it said `` Most schools do not have enough computers to make them a central tool of instruction.'' Exacerbating the access problem is the fact that computers tend to be concentrated in affluent schools with smaller student bodies, the report said. The agency report said black students, who generally attend larger schools, have less computer access than white students and `` students with limited English proficiency have the lowest access of all.'' Other problems cited in the report include inadequate teacher training, mediocre educational software and `` the absence of a coordinated federal policy, limited and short-term funding, erratic political support and disorganized research and development efforts across agencies ...'' Only one-third of teachers have even 10 hours of computer training, the agency found, and little of it focused on how to teach with computers. And while there are 10,000 educational software products available, <ORGANIZATION> OTA </ORGANIZATION> said, `` their quality could be much better ... Economic risks in the marketplace lead software publishers to play it safe.'' At the current rate of investment, <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> said, `` the nation can expect continuing experimentation in some schools, steady but slow improvement in software and spotty access to the technology by students.'' Speeding up the process will require greater efforts by the federal, state and local governments as well as the private sector, she said. On the federal level, <ORGANIZATION> OTA </ORGANIZATION> recommended boosting the current $ 240 million investment in learning technology research, including development of software; and encouraging school districts to buy more hardware and software with money from Chapter 1 and Chapter 2, federal programs for disadvantaged students and general education spending by states. The agency's report was requested by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. Committee chairman <PERSON> Augustus </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON>, D-Calif., said in comments accompanying the report that increased federal support for computers in the schools `` would be a good public policy and a wise investment for the future. Rep. <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, D-Calif., chairman of the panel's subcommittee on employment opportunities, said minority and limited-English students must be ensured equal access to `` Access to these technologies is spelled M-O-N-E-Y, but the schools our minority students attend are often overcrowded and underfunded,'' <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> said. `` Technology can narrow or widen these differences. If we do not act ... the classroom of tomorrow may always be left for manana in many of our schools.''

 <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>'s friend and law enforcement chief, <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shchelokov </PERSON>, accepted lavish gifts and huge bribes, then killed himself when his deeds were discovered, the government charged Tuesday. The allegations about the former Interior Minister, who died in disgrace in 1984, came on the second day of the bribery-corruption trial of <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Churbanov </PERSON>, <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>'s son-in-law. <PERSON> Churbanov </PERSON> served as <PERSON> Shchelokov </PERSON>'s top deputy. The charges included the first official confirmation of rumors that the 73-year-old <PERSON> Shchelokov </PERSON> committed suicide when he felt the law closing in. <PERSON> Churbanov </PERSON> and eight former <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> officials from the <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> republic of <LOCATION> Uzbekistan </LOCATION> are on trial before a <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> military tribunal. Their highly publicized trial is being used to further leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s drive against corruption and cronyism. The trial also is seen as a further attempt to discredit President <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>, whose 1964-1982 regime is routinely referred to by <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and his top officials as a period of stagnation in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. A 1,500-page indictment against the accused charges <PERSON> Churbanov </PERSON> with accepting the equivalent of $ 1 million in bribes, and its passages about <PERSON> Shchelokov </PERSON>, read aloud by a clerk to a full and silent courtroom, gave the most detailed account yet of corruption in the tops ranks of the <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> regime. Recent newspaper reports have said <PERSON> Shchelokov </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> chief for 16 years, lined his pockets with 700,000 rubles -LRB- $ 1.1 million -RRB- in state funds and lived an extravagant lifestyle, giving foreign luxury cars to his children and buying furs and crystal chandeliers for himself and his family. `` He wanted good, dry wines,'' the indictment said, and some of the defendants in the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> bribery-corruption trial allegedly obliged him. Six times a year, food shipments from <LOCATION> Uzbekistan </LOCATION> arrived at a <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> airport and were taken to <PERSON> Shchelekov </PERSON>'s country home outside the capital, the indictment said. The shipments contained cognac, tomatoes, melons, apricots and other fruits and vegetables unobtainable in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> most of the year. When he received gifts he liked, the account said, the minister, who was in charge of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s uniformed police force, always politely accepted them and said, `` I thank you.'' Sometimes, however, he refused to take things he did n't want. According to the indictment, <PERSON> Shchelokov </PERSON> once was taken to a factory in <LOCATION> Uzbekistan </LOCATION>, the center of the crime ring being exposed in the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> trial, and was offered clothes and other products made there. He reportedly declined and asked instead for a piece of jewelry for his wife. On another occasion, he received three pearls, each worth 3,300 rubles -LRB- $ 5,300 -RRB-, the indictment said. The court documents said boxes of money were left on <PERSON> Shchelokov </PERSON>'s desk. One of the nine defendants, former <ORGANIZATION> Uzbek </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> Minister <PERSON> Khaidar </PERSON> <PERSON> Yakhyaev </PERSON>, was quoted in the indictment as acknowledging that he gave his Moscow-based superior boss 105,000 rubles -LRB- $ 170,000 -RRB-, and neckties, gold jewelry, precious stones and other valuables. <PERSON> Yakhyaev </PERSON> explained the payments by saying they were necessary to `` win protection in the successful struggle against crime in the republic,'' the indictment said. Of <PERSON> Shchelokov </PERSON>, <PERSON> Yakhyaev </PERSON> said: `` He was a capable person, a good speaker and an influential man.'' <PERSON> Shchelokov </PERSON> was one of the closest confidants of <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>, who was <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief from 1964 until his death in December 1982. Under his tenure, the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> became notorious for corruption, and he was fired by <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>'s successor, former <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Andropov </PERSON>. The indictment referred to <PERSON> Shchelokov </PERSON> and two former Uzbek police officials, and said: `` Their involvement in the crimes committed was proved in full measure. However, fearing retribution for what they had done, they committed suicide. In view of this, the cases against them were abated.'' The trial in the neo-classic <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> building in central <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> entered its second day with one defendant absent because of a heart ailment. The judge rejected a defense request to halt the proceedings, which are giving Soviets a rare glimpse into the high living enjoyed by some Kremlin officials. Two other defendants were treated by a doctor in the courtroom, and the military tribunal's chief judge, <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Marov </PERSON>, called a 50-minute recess so <PERSON> Yakhyaev </PERSON>, who looked haggard and dazed, could have his blood pressure checked by a doctor clad in a white smock. The principal defendant in the case, <PERSON> Churbanov </PERSON>, who married <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>'s daughter <PERSON> Galina </PERSON>, could receive the death penalty if convicted on charges he accepted more than $ 1 million in cash bribes and gifts, as well as regular supplies of wine, cognac, pomegranates, grapes and other hard-to-find fruit flown to him via the Soviet airline <ORGANIZATION> Aeroflot </ORGANIZATION> from <LOCATION> Uzbekistan </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 Former <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> was given a two-day extension Tuesday to come up with a $ 3 million down payment as the first step of his $ 172 million proposal to buy the television ministry's assets. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> bankruptcy trustee M.C. `` Red'' <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> said they were still working out details of a contract for <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> to buy assets of the ministry he gave up after a sex and money scandal last year. The two men spoke with reporters after a one-hour meeting at the executive offices of <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION>, the entertainment, retail and hotel complex the ministry must sell as part of a Chapter 11 reorganization. `` The attorneys are still working on it and we hope to have something that's agreeable to everyone by tomorrow,'' said <PERSON> Benton </PERSON>, who had said on Friday that if the $ 3 million was n't available by Tuesday he would be forced to consider other bids. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> said he was about `` $ 100,000 short'' of the $ 3 million in cash and letters of credit. <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> said he was convinced <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> would have the entire amount and gave him until Thursday to deliver it. `` I'm thoroughly satisfied the $ 3 million line of credit, or its equivalent, will be there,'' said <PERSON> Benton </PERSON>, who explained that <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s offer had been raised from $ 165 million to $ 172 million. <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> had asked <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> for the $ 3 million as a show of good faith in his plan to buy the <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> theme park, a satellite network and undeveloped property near the Fort Mill-based ministry. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>, who left <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> in March 1987 after admitting to a sexual encounter with onetime church secretary <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON> <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON>, leads in the bidding to buy the assets of <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> has given <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> until Friday to present him with details of a financial deal between the former TV evangelist and an unidentified group of Greek businessmen. <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> said he will recommend a buyer to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Bankruptcy Judge <PERSON> Rufus </PERSON> <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> on Saturday. The trustee said he has `` four or five'' other bids for <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> besides the one by <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> and a standing offer of $ 113 million by Canadian real estate executive <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s offer may not be the only one presented to Reynolds on Saturday, <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> said, adding that any plan would be subject to a court hearing before final approval. On Friday, <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> had said he was `` very, very skeptical'' about whether <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> could complete the deal. He said Tuesday `` a lot has happened over the weekend'' to change his thinking. He dismissed suggestions that <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> was being given a lot of flexibility in meeting court-mandated deadlines. `` The judge is the one who sets the deadlines,'' <PERSON> Benton </PERSON> said. `` He set it for Saturday. By Friday, he -LRB- <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> -RRB- has to convince everyone that he has $ 77 million -LRB- as part of the purchase price -RRB-.'' After a jubilant <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> left <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday, his wife, <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON> <PERSON> Faye </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>, paid a surprise visit. `` I'm so excited ... I feel like I've got a butterfly in my tummy,'' she told reporters. Mrs. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> said she is confident her husband will be successful in getting the ministry back and that they will get the support of the public. `` I can look you in the eye and say we did n't misuse PTL or <LOCATION> Heritage </LOCATION> <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION>,'' she said. Mrs. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>, a gospel singer, said she already was rehearsing her opening song for the day she and her husband again have a television program. `` It will be ` The Sun Will Shine Again,''' she said.

 Police Tuesday recaptured an <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> prison escapee who was hiding out in a <ORGANIZATION> Salvation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> shelter only a block from police headquarters. Acting on a tip from an informant, police said they found <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Renton </PERSON>, 50, asleep in a crowded dormitory room. Police said they awakened and arrested him and seized a sawed-off shotgun, a 12-gauge pistol and several knives. <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> authorities `` think he is one of the probably most dangerous men we'll ever come in contact with,'' said senior Sgt. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Neely </PERSON>, one of those who arrested <LOCATION> Renton </LOCATION>. `` This guy said that he would kill cops. He's killed a cop before. He hates cops,'' added police spokesman C.F. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Renton </LOCATION> was one of four inmates who escaped July 11 from a maximum security prison at <LOCATION> Tucker </LOCATION>, Ark. The others have been captured. <LOCATION> Renton </LOCATION> had been sentenced to life in prison without parole for the abduction and slaying of <LOCATION> Springdale </LOCATION> policeman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussey </PERSON>, 22, in December 1975. From April 1976 until his arrest in May 1977, <LOCATION> Renton </LOCATION> was on the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s list of the 10 most wanted. He recently was placed on the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Marshal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>'s 15 most wanted list. <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> prison spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> said extradition proceedings were beginning immediately. <PERSON> Neely </PERSON> said a segment about <LOCATION> Renton </LOCATION> was broadcast recently on the `` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s Most Wanted'' television program. Although he had shaved off a mustache and gotten a close haircut, an informant recognized <LOCATION> Renton </LOCATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> Salvation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> shelter and contacted police, <PERSON> Neely </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Renton </LOCATION> `` said he had seen himself on ` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s Most Wanted' and he needed to change his appearance,'' <PERSON> Neely </PERSON> said. He said the unidentified informant may have recognized <LOCATION> Renton </LOCATION> by several tattoos.

I tapped him on the shoulder.'' <LOCATION> Renton </LOCATION> offered no resistance, the sergeant said.

 Sen. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Karnes </PERSON> drew boos from the crowd and criticism from opponent <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerrey </PERSON> when he told a crowds at the <ORGANIZATION> Nebraska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fair </ORGANIZATION> that `` We need fewer farmers at this point in time.'' `` I was perplexed when I heard all of the booing,'' <PERSON> Karnes </PERSON> said Monday after the first of eight debates between himself and the former one-term <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> governor. `` I obviously do n't support that statement. We should be able to encourage people to look at agriculture as an investment.'' <PERSON> Karnes </PERSON> was speaking about increased agricultural technology when he made the remark, to a standing-room-only audience of more than 2,000 people. He said later that he had misspoken and attributed it to `` the heat of the debate.'' <PERSON> Karnes </PERSON> said what he meant by the statement was that technology has allowed fewer farmers to do more work. <PERSON> Kerrey </PERSON>, after the debate, called <PERSON> Karnes </PERSON>' statement `` a mistake'' in political judgment. `` It is to assume again that we've got to have fewer farmers. It is to believe that there is nothing we can do to provide support for the farmers we have now,'' <PERSON> Kerrey </PERSON> said. Another <PERSON> Karnes </PERSON> slip brought applause and cheers from <PERSON> Kerrey </PERSON> supporters as the Republican rebutted <PERSON> Kerrey </PERSON>'s criticism of a diesel fuel tax amendment he sponsored. `` Mr. <PERSON> Kerrey </PERSON>, once you get to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> you'll know the importance of putting people on record,'' <PERSON> Karnes </PERSON> said <PERSON> Karnes </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Bahler </PERSON> said of the candidate's verbal fumbles: `` I'll be blunt. He is not as articulate as I would like him to be. `` But people understand Senator <PERSON> Karnes </PERSON> is not a smooth talker like his challenger. Sometimes his words get jumbled. But do we want a senator that is a smooth talker or one who knows his stuff?'' <PERSON> Karnes </PERSON>, who was appointed to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> after the death of Democrat <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Zorinsky </PERSON>, is seeking election to his first full term.

 <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> sent <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s prime minister a letter Tuesday criticizing him for trying to resign, and analysts said long-submerged political differences in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> are coming to the surface Prime Minister <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Musavi </PERSON> attempted to resign Monday to avoid what he feared would be a no-confidence vote in parliament over the <LOCATION> post-Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> war reconstruction policies he advocates. <PERSON> Musavi </PERSON>'s resignation was rejected by President <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON> hours before parliament was due to vote, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said in a report monitored from <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>. `` If you decided to resign, it would have been better if you had at least informed me or other high ranking officials,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tehran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> said, quoting <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s letter. `` At a time when Muslims donate their sons to help Islam, this is not the right time for complaining and resigning,'' the letter said, in a reference to the 1 million casualties suffered in the eight-year Iran-Iraq war. Both sides accepted a U.N.-sponsered cease-fire on Aug. 20. The fact that parliament might exercise its right to reject <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> ministers was not sufficient cause for resigning, <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>'s letter said. <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>, adopting a fatherly tone at the end of the letter, said he liked <PERSON> Musavi </PERSON> and suggested they meet soon so he could remind the prime minister of the problems <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> still faces. Western analysts who specialize in Iranian affairs said <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> may have intervened to keep <PERSON> Musavi </PERSON>'s government in office a few more months to prevent a rupture right after the cease-fire with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. They noted that <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> rescued <PERSON> Musavi </PERSON> from a no-confidence vote in the 270-seat Majlis, or parliament, four years ago to avoid a split while the war was at its height. Word of the resignation offer first surfaced when <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Jomhuri </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eslami </ORGANIZATION>, a publication of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s Islamic clerics that <PERSON> Musavi </PERSON> once edited, printed his lengthy letter to <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON> <PERSON> Musavi </PERSON>, prime minister since 1981, said his planning and budget minister, <PERSON> Massoud </PERSON> <PERSON> Zanjani </PERSON>, resigned Saturday and that the future of his energy, construction and trade ministers were in doubt. <PERSON> Musavi </PERSON> said he believed `` five to eight of his ministers will not get the vote of confidence needed for them to continue their responsibilities.'' He did not identify all eight, who comprise more than one-third of the 21-man cabinet he named July 21 after parliamentary elections in April and May. He acknowledged `` differences of opinion with regard to domestic and international policies,'' but said they must not `` detract from the need for unity in confronting conspiracies.'' <PERSON> Shavan </PERSON> <PERSON> Chubin </PERSON>, a Geneva-based specialist on Iranian affairs, said <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>, `` if he wants to avoid change at this critical time, could simply tell the <LOCATION> Majlis </LOCATION> to vote for <PERSON> Musavi </PERSON> _ for now.'' That meeting, intially set for Tuesday, was rescheduled for Sunday. <PERSON> Chubin </PERSON> said in a telephone interview that `` the passing of the war was bound to reopen old schisms. There were bound to be difficulties as <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> moved into the post-war era. <PERSON> Chubin </PERSON> and other analysts, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said <PERSON> Musavi </PERSON> has been at odds over post-war reconstruction and economic development with <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s military commander and powerful parliament speaker `` The portfolios <PERSON> Musavi </PERSON> mentioned indicate that the problem lies primarily in the economic sector,'' <PERSON> Chubin </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Musavi </PERSON> has long advocated greater state control of the economy. He was opposed by <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON>, who has close links with the `` bazaaris,'' the wealthy merchant class, and by conservative clerics. That split, which has intensified political uncertainty, sharpened when the fighting stopped. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s leaders announced they had begun planning the massive task of post-war reconstruction, including to what extent <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> should call in foreign companies to help it rebuild. `` <PERSON> Musavi </PERSON> is not keen on getting involved with foreign companies and having <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> go into debt,'' <PERSON> Chubin </PERSON> said. `` <PERSON> Khamenei </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> take a more practical approach.''

 Democratic vice presidential candidate <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> foraged for Southern votes on Tuesday by emphasizing education and training to help meet foreign competition _ and chiding Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for a late conversion to the cause. `` If we want to retain our position of world leadership, <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> must be able to compete for world markets,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said. `` We must have the best-trained, most highly motivated workforce, the best universities and the best teachers.'' And unlike <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said in a speech at the <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Polytechnic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, Democratic presidential nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has been on the education bandwagon from the start. `` <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> did n't just suddenly wake up one morning and decide he wanted to be ` the education president,''' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said, alluding to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s claim to the description. `` <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> have accepted a lifelong commitment to education. `` For eight years now we've watched the Reagan-Bush administration trash educational opportunity across this country,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> told a rowdy student audience packed into the college auditorium. Following the speech, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> moved outside for a rally before several hundred more students, including a strong-voiced contingent for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and some carrying signs that read, `` Duke buster,'' and `` Avoid the Lloyd.'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, interrupted in his remarks, looked at that group and said, `` I met <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> once before,'' alluding to his defeat of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in a 1970 Texas Senate race. `` And I think <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> season is starting early this year.'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said college alone does not provide all of the nation's important education as he started his day visiting a technical training center in the <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Lawrenceville </LOCATION> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> handled a soldering iron and other tools, including a microscope, to inspect the work. Afterward, he told reporters the federal government could do more to provide `` seed money'' to expand technical training. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has `` put all kinds of speed bumps in the way to achieving education,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said. A Democratic administration, he said, would promote programs such as the one at the <ORGANIZATION> Gwinnett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> where he attended the class with nine women learning to make electronic circuit boards. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> also said he personally favored a longer school year for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> children, citing figures from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. But he said that issue would be decided at the state and local level, not by the federal government. Polls show the Republican ticket leading in both <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, but <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said he considered both states within range for the Democrats, especially since they were receiving support from locally-elected officials. Rep. <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON>, D-Ga., attended the session at <LOCATION> Gwinnett </LOCATION> with <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, and <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> Gov <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Baliles </PERSON> and former Gov. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Robb </PERSON>, now a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> candidate, were awaiting <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> at the college in <LOCATION> Blacksburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION> `` I think we'll get those Democrats who voted for <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> coming back to us,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> told reporters, adding that polls backed up his statement. `` To the extend we can bring them back, we're going to do it.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' support of gun control laws is one of the obstacles in that effort. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, who usually opposes such measures, said he had not yet decided whether to support an amendment now before the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said the underlying concept in the amendment of a waiting period for handgun purchases was appealing, since it would provide a `` cooling off period'' for people wanting a gun for emotional reasons. It also would give officials time to determine if the purchaser was a criminal, he said. However, he said he had not studied how far the amendment extended beyond that and was withholding any endorsement. The <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> senator was returning to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for a vote Wednesday on a bill to help the textile industry _ also an important issue in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> where many factories have been hurt by foreign competition. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> planned to resume campaigning Thursday, beginning in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and finishing the week in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, with a stop in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> en route.

 Many Hispanics contend bullfighting is an important part of their culture, but animal welfare officials said Tuesday they do n't want any repeats of the city's first `` bloodless bullfight.'' <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Poholik </PERSON>, executive director of the city's <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Animal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Care </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION>, said he already has received _ and will reject _ a request for a permit for another bullfight, on Sept. 18. He said he was asking the mayor and <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> to move as soon as possible to specifically ban the bloodless fights. Matadors in the bullfights use the traditional cape to taunt the bull, but instead of the `` death in the afternoon'' immortalized by author <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Hemingway </PERSON>, the bull is tagged with Velcro-tipped darts aimed at Velcro patches glued to his back, the coup de grace administered with a Velcro-tipped sword. `` It's a bullfight where they do n't poke any holes in the animal,'' <PERSON> Poholik </PERSON> said. Nevertheless, he believes the fights violate a city ordinance that forbids `` torture, tortment or baiting'' of animals. `` The bull is not of a good temperament to begin with, and all of the teasing gets him really enraged. ... It's just another example of man's cruelty to animals.'' About 1,100 people watched as three 1,000-pound bulls charged matadors' capes, occasionally flipping one of the men, in bullfights Saturday and Sunday. While <PERSON> Poholik </PERSON> initially denied bullfight promoters a permit, <ORGANIZATION> Cook </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Albert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Green </ORGANIZATION> ordered it granted on grounds the confrontations were no more cruel than rodeos, which the city allows. `` What do you do at a rodeo? The guy gets on the bull and kicks it with his spurs to incite it,'' <PERSON> Green </PERSON> said Tuesday. `` Some people consider a bullfight a ballet.'' `` It was beautiful,'' said <PERSON> Bella </PERSON> <PERSON> Jonas </PERSON>, who attended Saturday's fight `` Nobody even hurt the bull, and now they want to stop because of cruelty. It was just plain art.'' `` All these people, they do n't want the <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> people to have what's theirs,'' said <PERSON> Homer </PERSON> <PERSON> Alvarado </PERSON>, leader of <ORGANIZATION> MEDA </ORGANIZATION>, a charity that helps the poor and received meat from the bulls, which were slaughtered after the weekend fights staged and promoted by <ORGANIZATION> Jaass </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Productions </ORGANIZATION>. `` They're discriminating against us. They have a rodeo. Why do n't they stop it?'' But state Rep. <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> said that `` as far as I'm concerned, I'm born in this country and it's not a sport I'm interested in.'' <PERSON> Poholik </PERSON> says that while he is `` not all that happy about rodeo,'' it is a recognized sporting event in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and as such is allowed. `` We're trying to limit the long list of animal exploitation going on,'' he said. `` How far do we let this cultural tradition go? In <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, they eat dogs. In <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, cockfighting is legal.'' Bullfighting originated in <LOCATION> Crete </LOCATION> about 2,000 B.C. and was popular for centuries among the wealthy until Pope <PERSON> Pius </PERSON> <PERSON> V </PERSON>, concerned about numerous deaths, threatened to excommunicate practitioners in 1567. The ban did not curb the sport's popularity in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, however, and the prohibition was lifted. It remains popular in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. The bloodless Velcro version has been allowed in three other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> states, <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Poholik </PERSON> said he plans to deny another permit to the bullfight promoters. <PERSON> Alvarado </PERSON> says promoters will appeal that ruling. <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> is backing <PERSON> Poholik </PERSON>'s effort. `` I certainly respect the culture and traditions of the Hispanic community,'' <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> said in a statement. `` But I also respect the feelings of many Chicagoans who believe that a bullfight constitutes cruelty to animals.'' <PERSON> Poholik </PERSON> said that despite his effort to prevent future bullfights, which probably will take at least a month, he was impressed by the care of the bulls before and after the weekend contests. `` I'll give the people credit for keeping the animals well,'' he said. `` They appeared to be in excellent condition.''

 The identity of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s $ 55.2 million lottery winner remained a mystery Tuesday, but state officials announced one sure victor: schoolchildren. <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> puts 35 percent of lottery sales to education, which now equals $ 350 million in the lottery's first eight months. Officials said the total is twice as much as earlier projections. Gov. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, who opposes the lottery, said Tuesday the state broke $ 1 billion in sales during last week's record number of ticket purchases, which contributed to the world's largest single lottery jackpot. `` This record-breaking pace is exciting, both for the players and public education in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> said. `` While the lottery was never envisioned to meet all the funding needs of education, it's good to know that the games are doing so much to enhance our basic school program.'' Meanwhile, lottery officials say they have heard from several people who claim to have the winning ticket. The six winning numbers were picked in a drawing Saturday night, and lottery officials determined by computer the next day that only one ticket _ purchased by someone in <LOCATION> Longwood </LOCATION> in central <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> _ had the winning combination. A person claiming to represent <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>, a school janitor in the Panhandle town of <LOCATION> Bristol </LOCATION>, called the <ORGANIZATION> Lottery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday and said <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> would come to <LOCATION> Tallahassee </LOCATION> Wednesday with the winning ticket, said Lottery Secretary <PERSON> Rebecca </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>. `` We have no reason to believe that he does or that he does n't until he comes forward with the actual ticket and it goes through our validation process we really do n't know,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> said `` We've talked to a whole bunch of people who say they have the winning ticket,'' she said. At least three other people have called the department claiming to have the winning ticket, according to <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>, deputy secretary of operations. Mrs. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> said one of the callers identified himself as a resident of <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, and another caller came from central <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. `` We've had several dozen calls from folks saying ` We have the winning ticket _ what do we do?' without identifying themselves or their city or anything else,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> said. Winners have 180 days to claim their prizes. One unknown _ the exact amount of the prize _ was determined, Mrs. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> said. The jackpot's final value was put at $ 55.2 million Tuesday, which breaks down into 20 annual payments of $ 2.7 million before taxes. Earlier, estimates put the record jackpot at $ 54 million.

<HEAD>Capsule Landing Problem Reminds Soviets of Danger of Spaceflight</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Soviet-Space, Bjt</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, the first country to put a man in space, has helped make manned space flight routine, giving officials confidence to televise launches and landings live and invite foreigners to climb aboard for a ride. But, like the explosion of the space shuttle Challenger, Tuesday's aborted landing of an Afghan-Soviet space crew again pointed up the dangers of space flight. `` We are already used to everything going smoothly in space,'' commentator <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Tikhomirov </PERSON> told millions of Soviets in a prime time television newscast. `` And some forget about the danger which space research entails. And here, this once more convinces us how complex a matter it is and what a huge amount of abnormal situations awaits cosmonauts in orbit.'' The landing abort threatened to strand two cosmonauts in space with rapidly diminishing supplies of oxygen and food. It came during a busy year in the Soviet manned space program and at a time when the American space shuttle still is grounded because of the Jan. 28, 1986, Challenger disaster, in which all seven crew died. The most enduring symbol of Soviet commitment to manned spaceflight has been the orbiting Mir space station. The research complex, launched in February 1986, is planned as a permanently manned fixture in space. Two cosmonauts have been aboard Mir since last Dec. 21 and plan to break the 326-day space endurance record set by <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Romanenko </PERSON> aboard Mir last year. In June, a Soviet-Bulgarian crew spent 10 days in space, including a visit to Mir. A Soviet-French crew is to blast off Nov. 21 for a monthlong mission. Whether the problems with the Afghan-Soviet mission will delay the Soviet-French flight is not yet clear. Other scheduled flights include a 1990 voyage by an Austrian cosmonaut and a <LOCATION> Malaysian </LOCATION> cosmonaut later. Soviet officials also have indicated they will launch their own space shuttle, unmanned, by year's end. They have emphasized the shuttle will not be flown manned until it is proven safe. The Soviet space program _ long veiled in secrecy since it began with the Oct. 4, 1957, launch of the first satellite, <LOCATION> Sputnik </LOCATION> _ has benefited from <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policy of glasnost, or openness. Since <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Gagarin </PERSON> blasted off as the first man in space in 1961, manned launches have become routine. Soviet officials gained confidence to show launches and in some cases landings on live television and to invite foreigners to watch the blastoffs. The first live TV coverage of a Soviet manned space launch was the Apollo-Soyuz mission in 1975. The first launch to be shown live of an all-Russian crew was in 1984. Space has also served political purposes for the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Prior to the Afghan mission, the Soviets had 13 `` guest cosmonauts'' aboard their spacecraft in flights that serve to show off their scientific prowess and promote friendly ties with other countries. Soviets have to think back 17 years to find their last fatal space disaster. Three cosmonauts docked with the Salyut-1 space station, and then during re-entry on June 30, 1971, air leaked out of their capsule and they suffocated. The other casualty of a Soviet space flight was <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Komarov </PERSON>. <PERSON> Komarov </PERSON>'s Soyuz-I capsule crash landed April 24, 1967, but Soviet officials never explained what exactly went wrong. Western space experts believe six to eight other cosmonauts died in training accidents on the ground from 1960-1975.

 a fire in parched grass and pine exploded in 24 hours from just 160 acres to more than 25,000 acres Tuesday, sending firefighters fleeing and burning toward some of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state's prime orchards. Fire bosses set up a command post in the tiny <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Entiat </LOCATION>, while helicopters dipped huge buckets into the river and then dumped water on the steep smoldering hillsides above town. The town itself, on the opposite side of the Entiat River from the fire, was in no immediate danger from the flames, which had been blown to within an estimated half a mile of the community of 400 people. The Dinkelman fire's explosive growth overran at least one bulldozer that could not move fast enough and a pickup that broke down, said <PERSON> Art </PERSON> <PERSON> Tasker </PERSON> of the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION>. No serious injuries were reported. `` It's extremely erratic and very, very volatile,'' <PERSON> Tasker </PERSON> said. `` There are gusty winds. It's very dry and very steep. `` I watched it move a half a mile in 10 minutes last night.'' National Guard troops called out by Gov. <PERSON> Booth </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON> late Monday were to handle kitchen and camp duties for about 600 firefighters. Intense heat in narrow Mills Canyon caused one home to burst into flames, even though trails had been dug around the home and firefighters had burned away excess vegetation, <PERSON> Tasker </PERSON> said. The fire, reported Sunday afternoon, was reported at just 500 acres as late as 4:30 p.m. Monday. But by 7:30 p.m. it was 3,000 acres, and by 4 a.m. Tuesday it was at least 20,000 acres. The fire was burning on steep hills covered with sage, grass, pine, and some <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> fir, and was beginning to butt up against some orchards in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s premier fruit-growing region. The burned territory was mostly <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> land, but also included state land and <ORGANIZATION> Longview </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fibre </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> property. `` It's an explosive kind of situation,'' DNR spokesman <PERSON> Rob </PERSON> <PERSON> Harper </PERSON> said. `` If you look at the conditions out there, eastern <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> is extremely dry. ... The wind is the final ingredient that you need after you get the fire started.''

 <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> denied on Tuesday that he was angry that Democratic presidential nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> excluded him from a meeting with <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> party leaders. He said he hoped by the end of the week to work out his role in the fall campaign. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, in a telephone interview from his home in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, contradicted associates who charecterized him as upset by the omission _ including one who said he was `` seething.'' `` I just hate for people to be allowed to put words in my mouth or give some adjective description of what my emotions are,'' he said of the associates, who commented only on condition they not be named. He said he spoke by telephone to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' campaign vice chairman and confidant, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sasso </PERSON>, Monday night and Tuesday morning and they arranged to meet later this week to discuss <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s participation in the campaign and the relationship and message of the campaign to `` targeted groups'' such as <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s constituents in the primary season Asked if he would get a schedule of campaign appearances at this meeting, the Democratic presidential runner-up said, `` I certainly hope so.'' He said they did not discuss the meeting <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> held outside <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s home base of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> on Tuesday with state party leaders, including Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, Rep. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON>, and others. `` I did n't know anything about it other than the press inquiries. So I have no comment to make,'' said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. `` I'm working. I'm hopeful. I'm registering voters,'' he said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' state press secretary <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Erwin </PERSON> said the Tuesday meeting was more for state leaders, and that <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was considered a national leader. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> indicated he is anxious to get under way with his part of the fall campaign, as he agreed to do just before the Democrats nominated <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> at their <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> convention this summer. He declined to criticize <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, despite a series of omissions that some <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> supporters have perceived as slights. `` If they do n't want his help they ought to tell him,'' said one top <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> adviser, who asked not to be identified by name. Asked about the appearance that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has been slow to involve him in the campaign, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said, `` There are some decisions the campaign has to make about how it will employ its volunteers,'' including people such as <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>, Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> and himself. `` I assume that's the kind of thing <PERSON> Sasso </PERSON> will be doing,'' he added. `` The plans are incomplete. I hope they will be complete soon. ... hese areas dealing with campaign direction and priorities still have to be worked out. I hope before this week is out that all of the remaining areas will be resolved and we'll be on our way.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign spokesman <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Dach </PERSON> denied any attempt to slight <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and said the meeting with <PERSON> Sasso </PERSON> this week will include discussion of `` how we can best work together, places details, themes.'' He said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> regularly talks to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and campaign officials. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said he wants to talk to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> officials about involving some of his supporters at the national policy level of the campaign, and about targeting the Democratic message and priorities. The most recently reported tension involved reports that the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> camp had conducted polling that found <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> had high negative ratings in some states where he beat <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in the primaries and that the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> officials had indicated they did not want <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> campaigning in those states. While these reports came from sources close to <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and the national <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> himself said he had received no such direction. Asked if the subject of states he should stay away from was discussed in a meeting he had with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign chairman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Brountas </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> two weeks ago, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said, `` I was not in any such meetings when there was discussion over where and what the priority areas ought to be.'' Asked if the information was imparted through aides, as one source stated, he said, `` I do n't have anything in writing on that.'' `` I do n't want to discuss it because I do n't know very much about it, but obvously I'm free to travel all over the country and I will,'' he added. While some around <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> have described him as annoyed and upset at how the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign has treated him and his constituents, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> publicly continues to tout the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> ticket in his speeches, and refused to make negative comments under questioning.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>, accused of taking part in the hijacking of a <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> jetliner and the killing of a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> diver, went to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> after the crime, according to court reports Tuesday. The reports, based on transcripts of tapped telephone calls, were presented to a <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> court. They indicated <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> for about three months and was helped while in hiding by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s Revolutionary Guards. <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>, a Lebanese Shiite Moslem, has been accused of air piracy and murder. He went on trial here after <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> refused a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> extradition request. <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> flight 847 was hijacked in June 1985 and 39 Americans were held captive aboard the plane for 17 days. <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> diver <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON> was shot and killed by the sky pirates who comandeered the jet during a flight from <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> and forced it to land in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. Former hostage <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Hoffman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Estates </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, is scheduled to testify Wednesday. He will be the first <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> to testify in the trial that reopened Tuesday after a four-week recess. Prosecutors say <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> was a member of <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, a pro-Iranian <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> group believed to hold most of the 18 foreigners, including nine Americans, kidnapped by terrorists in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> has admitted he was one of the <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> hijackers but insists he did not kill <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON>, 23. The court on Tuesday examined transcripts of tapped telephone calls <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> made from <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> to his brother, <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>, after the hijacking was over. In an Aug. 14, 1985, telephone call to <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>'s home in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> said, `` I'm phoning from <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>.'' According to the transcript, <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> told his brother he was staying in an Iranian town near the Afghan border and he added: `` I've been here more than a month and it's very boring. I'm just sitting around.'' In another telephone call from <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> on Oct. 13, 1985, <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> told his brother he was going back to <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> the next day, but <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> warned him he would be arrested because he was wanted by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities, according to the transcripts. <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> also said, `` We're going on a military plane to <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and then we're taking a military car to <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> then asked him who told him about the travel arrangements and his broher replied, `` The Revolutionary Guards.' In earlier testimony <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> told the court he was in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> to visit Moslem shrines. He refused to answer any questions Tuesday about his stay in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> had admitted at the trial's session on Aug. 9 before the recess began that he took part in the hijacking. Tuesday he refused to answer answer many questions from Chief Judge <PERSON> Heiner </PERSON> <PERSON> Mueckenberger </PERSON> about what happened aboard the hijacked plane but repeated his denial that he killed <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON>. `` I already said the other -LRB- one of his accomplices -RRB- was responsible and he was the murderer,'' <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> said. `` Our orders were not to kill. We were told to hijack the plane, to force it to land and to state our demands. But not to kill,'' he said. He would not say who issued those orders. <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> said again that the hijackers' goal was to force the release of Lebanese prisoners held by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Shortly after the hijacking was over <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> released about 700 prisoners. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have indicted four people in the hijacking, including <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> last year rejected a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> extradition request for <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>, saying he would be tried here on the same charges. <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> was arrested on Jan. 13, 1987, at <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> airport, when customs inspectors found explosives in his luggage. In April, a <LOCATION> Duesseldorf </LOCATION> court sentenced <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> to 13 years in prison for involvement in the abductions of two German businessmen in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in an unsuccessful attempt to force <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> to free <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> from prison.

 Police came to Archbishop <PERSON> Desmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON>'s residence Tuesday and seized a tape of a sermon in which the clergyman defied a government ban and called for an election boycott, <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON>'s spokesman said. Meanwhile, the country's largest black-oriented daily newspaper said Tuesday it will no longer carry government advertisements promoting the local elections. The Sowetan, in a notice on its front page, said: `` It has become impossible to justify carrying these advertisements when the community we serve is barred from expressing its sentiments on the elections.'' Many blacks oppose participation in any local or regional elections until the black majority is allowed to vote in national elections. <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON>, whose sermon Sunday defied the government ban on calls for an election boycott, had offered to provide police with a transcript of his remarks. However, two plainclothes officers came to the Anglican archbishop's official residence outside <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>, produced a warrant and demanded a recording which <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON>'s press aide, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, had made of the sermon. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, after consulting the church's legal advisers, gave police the tape and a statement confirming the contents of the recording. But <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> said he would not be prepared to give evidence if the state tried to call him as a witness against <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON>. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, in a telephone interview, said police had called in advance to say they were coming and did not ask to see <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON>, who was meeting with church members. In his sermon at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> George </ORGANIZATION>'s Cathedral in <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> deliberately defied state-of-emergency regulations by urging both whites and blacks to boycott nationwide municipal elections scheduled for Oct. 26. A pro-government newspaper, The Citizen, Tuesday quoted unidentified government sources as saying action against <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> was likely. It quoted one source as saying failure to act against the black archbishop would encourage other people to join in calling for a boycott. Violation of the emergency regulations is punishable by up to 10 years in prison. The Oct. 26 elections will mark the first time that voters of all races go to the polls on the same day. The white-controlled government is depicting the elections as a major step toward democracy and is spending hundreds of thousands of dollars on advertising to encourage a large turnout. <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON>'s comments angered <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>'s mayor, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Muller </PERSON>, who said they could jeopardize the election prospects of liberal candidates. Because of <PERSON> Muller </PERSON>'s criticism, <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> decided not to attend a ceremony Monday night at which a prominent mixed-race academic, Dr. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> der </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON>, become the first non-white to be awarded the freedom of the city.

 Hundreds of Israeli troops sealed off a <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> town Tuesday, cutting telephone lines, arresting more than 150 Palestinians and assembling makeshift army bases in a new tactic aimed at crushing the uprising. Underground leaders distributed a leaflet in the occupied territories calling on Palestinians to attack Israeli targets with `` more firebombs and more stones, everywhere and anywhere.'' A 17-year-old Palestinian, shot in the eye on Sunday during clashes with troops, died of his wounds Tuesday, relatives said. An <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldier was hurt slightly when he kicked an old pipe that contained explosives, the army said. The death brought to 259 the number of Palestinians killed since the uprising began Dec. 8. Four Israelis have also died. Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Gabi </PERSON> <PERSON> Ofir </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> army commander, said Tuesday's pre-dawn raid on <LOCATION> Qalqilya </LOCATION>, backed by helicopters, was the largest army operation in nine months of unrest The army imposed a curfew on <LOCATION> Qalqilya </LOCATION> before dawn and soldiers moved in through outlying orchards and fields, forming a human chain around the town of 25,000. Troops closed all roads leading to the city. Soldiers carried lists of suspected stone-throwers and arrested more than 150 Palestinians, the army said. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> television showed dozens of <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION>, their hands tied behind their backs, sitting in large open-sided tents. Troops herded dozens of blindfolded detainees through a major street. Reporters in <LOCATION> Qalqilya </LOCATION> saw dozens of troops patrolling streets and three <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> youths being held in a jeep with their hands tied behind them. Singling out <LOCATION> Qalqilya </LOCATION>, which lies just inside the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and only three minutes by car from <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>'s northern suburbs, appeared to be the army's latest tactic for cracking down on activist Palestinian towns. The move prompted concern among Palestinians that other villages would be targeted. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> commander Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Amram </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitzna </PERSON> said the operation was planned for weeks and targeted <LOCATION> Qalqilya </LOCATION> because its residents include key instigators of firebomb and stone-throwing attacks on Jewish settlers and <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops. <PERSON> Mitzna </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> that `` the situation had become intolerable, therefore we decided -LRB- to act -RRB- now.'' Palestinian taxi drivers turned back at army roadblocks reported seeing four helicopters flying overhead and dozens of army vehicles, some pulling mobile homes normally used in makeshift army bases. The witnesses said troops knocked down a wall separating a playground and high school and were pitching tents on the grounds. `` It is the first time I've seen such activity. It is really strange and we are worried other villages will be next,'' one Arab taxi driver told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> on condition of anonymity. An army spokesman said troops discovered stashes of knives, hatchets and clubs as well as outlawed underground leaflets in <LOCATION> Qalqilya </LOCATION>. In the latest leaflet, underground leaders also called for three general strikes in two weeks, including a strike Thursday to mark the ninth month of the Palestinian uprising. The leaflet also highlighted a deepening split between Moslem fundamentalists and uprising leaders who support the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. It criticized the fundamentalists for declaring alternative strike days and attacking shopkeepers who did not comply. <PERSON> Abdel </PERSON> <PERSON> Karim </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahmoud </PERSON> <PERSON> Barud </PERSON>, 17, from the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> refugee camp <LOCATION> Rafah </LOCATION>, who was shot in the eye Sunday, died Tuesday at <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hashomer </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>, his relatives said. Hospital officials could not be reached for comment. The army said it had no information on the death. Also Tuesday, troops shot and wounded four Palestinian teen-agers while confronting stone-throwers in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>'s Nuseirat refugee camp, hospital officials said. The army said it was checking the report. Near <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldier was treated at the scene for minor injuries and returned to his unit after a pipe bomb exploded. Newly released Israeli figures indicated the Palestinian population growth in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> was fulfilling predictions that Arabs could outnumber Jews in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and its occupied territories by the year 2000. The figures put the annual population growth in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> at 3.4 percent in 1986, one of the highest rates in the world. This compares with an annual population growth of 1.3 percent inside <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>.

 <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> secretary-general, asked the permanent <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> members Tuesday to unequivocally accept compulsory jurisdiction of the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. Of the five, only <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> accepts the court's jurisdiction as compulsory. <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> have filed no formal declarations of acceptance, although that does not bar them from appearing before the court. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> severely curtailed its acceptance of court jurisdiction in 1984, just before <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> filed a complaint against the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, accusing it of aiding rebels fighting the <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> government. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> said Tuesday, `` Widespread acceptance of the jurisdiction of the court as compulsory would, particularly if taken by the permanent members of the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, put to maximum use the role of the court as a stabilizing factor in international relations.'' The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> chief spoke at a ceremony celebrating the 75th anniversary of the Peace Palace, of which the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> is the major tenant. The court, officially known as the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION>, is the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> judicial branch. Dutch Queen <PERSON> Beatrix </PERSON>, Premier <PERSON> Ruud </PERSON> <PERSON> Lubbers </PERSON> and World Court President <PERSON> Jose-Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruda </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> were among the dignitaries attending. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government boycotted the last 17 months of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s case against it The court ultimately condemned <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> support for the rebels, known as Contras, and ordered an immediate halt to such aid. In an apparent reference to that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> move, <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> said, `` Other -LRB- nations -RRB- have, when their interests were at stake, chosen not to take part in the court's proceedings or to ignore its decisions, a development that gives rise to considerable concern.'' Only 49 nations now accept the compulsory jurisdiction of the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, which has no enforcement powers and depends on voluntary adherence to its rulings by nations not recognizing its authority unequivocally.

<TEXT>
 A scandal involving citizens paying thousands of dollars to avoid military service has shaken <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, where the army is considered a sacred institution and most believe their nation is surrounded by <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> enemies. The story of Israelis paying up to $ 10,000 in bribes to avoid serving has been front-page news and dominated radio broadcasts Tuesday. `` Shock waves swept through the <ORGANIZATION> IDF </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- Israeli <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>, or army -RRB- ... following the disclosure that a network of army personnel and civilians had been arranging exemptions from military service in return for bribes,'' the English-language daily <ORGANIZATION> Jerusalem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Renaan </PERSON> <PERSON> Gissin </PERSON>, the deputy spokesman for the army, said the scheme that was revealed Monday with the arrest of 16 people, including high-ranking officers and doctors, and `` touches on the very essence of the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> Defense Forces _ the sacred principle here is to do military service.'' <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> is a nation of 4.1 million residents where both men and women are drafted at age 18, and men do reserve service of up to 62 days a year until age 55. Many job advertisements ask that applicants to prove they served in the army. Avoiding service has long been a social taboo. There are virtually no conscientious draft resisters in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and fewer than 300 people have refused service during the last decade in controversial military operations in places such as <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and the occupied territories. But after the scandal broke Monday, reports surfaced that about 60 people had paid thousands of dollars to escape the draft or reserve service. Newspapers reported Tuesday that several hundred people may be involved. The army said dozens more arrests are expected. <PERSON> Gissin </PERSON> called the number of people involved unprecedented, saying: `` This is just the tip of the iceberg. The last word has not been said.'' The scheme, which investigators say started in November, reportedly involved falsified medical statements and tampering with army computers to show men excused from reserve duty. Those arrested include two lieutenant colonels, two majors and an orthopedic surgeon. Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> described the scheme as an aberration, but said he would order a full investigation of the medical exemption system. `` We have to remove this disease from the healthy body of the army with all means available,'' he said on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> television. `` Parallel to that, we have to examine our means of supervision in the defense system.'' Politicians of both the right and left went farther, urging re-evaluation of Israeli society and saying the values of its pioneer days were being lost. <PERSON> Geula </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> of the rightist <ORGANIZATION> Tehiya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> said such corruption is rooted in `` an atmosphere of materialism and abandonment of the ideals of national responsibility.'' `` We must all do a self-evaluation about the type of society we're building here, a society where everything can be bought with power or money,'' said <PERSON> Gad </PERSON> <PERSON> Yatsiv </PERSON> of the left-wing <ORGANIZATION> Mapam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. The Hadashot newspaper editorialized: `` A terrible tragedy has befallen the army. A mafia has overtaken one of its most sensitive nerve centers. These actions are as bad as selling secrets to the enemy.'' The mass-circulation daily <ORGANIZATION> Maariv </ORGANIZATION> said: `` This is not just fraud but making profit from bloodshed.'' <PERSON> Gissin </PERSON> said the army view was that the draft-dodging scheme `` permeated'' from corruption in Israeli society. `` You can not open the newspaper without seeing such affairs of bribery and fraud,'' he said. `` But it is inconceivable to have it in the <ORGANIZATION> IDF </ORGANIZATION> because it is a unique institution.'' <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Horowitz </PERSON>, a sociologist at <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Hebrew </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> shared _ like other societies _ the problem of corruption. But he expressed surprise the scheme had not been uncovered sooner because of Israelis' special attitude to the military. `` What amazes me is the number of people involved and nobody informed the authorities,'' he said. `` It means there are no more taboos in Israeli society, people do n't want to be involved.''

 Police on Tuesday captured a convicted murderer who escaped from a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> prison where he was awaiting execution. Police Inspector <PERSON> Vic </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON> said <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Kindler </PERSON>, 27, who beat a man to death in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> in 1984, was arrested at work by Saint <PERSON> John </PERSON> police. <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON> would not say where <PERSON> Kindler </PERSON> worked because `` the people there are terrified.'' Police said they received a tip Monday from a local resident that <PERSON> Kindler </PERSON> was in the city. He was arrested Tuesday morning without incident and was remanded to the Saint <PERSON> John </PERSON> jail at an afternoon court appearance.

<HEAD>Traffic Accidents Claim more than 400 Lives over Holiday Weekend</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Traffic accidents during the Labor Day weekend on the nation's roads killed more than 400 people, which is slightly lower than the death toll a year ago. By midnight Monday, state and local police in the 50 states had recorded 422 deaths since the holiday period began at 6 p.m. local time Friday. `` We're making some progress,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Tippie </PERSON>, director of traffic safety for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION>. During the 1987 Labor Day weekend, authorities reported 453 traffic deaths nationwide. <PERSON> Tippie </PERSON> attributed the lower figures to fewer travelers and greater safety awareness. `` People are cutting back and not taking as many trips as they used to take, and when they do, they buckle up or make sure not to drink and drive,'' he said. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, the most populous state, had the highest number of traffic fatalities at 45, followed by <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> with 30 and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> at 27. <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> each reported no fatal accidents. The council had estimated that 420 to 520 people could lose their lives in highway accidents during the holiday period. Safety-council statisticians say 410 traffic deaths could be expected during a non-holiday, three-day weekend at this time of the year. The highest toll for the Labor Day holiday was logged in 1968, when 688 people were killed.

 The nation's three mightiest rivers began receding Tuesday but the most urgent problem grew: how to provide food, shelter and clean water to at least 21 million homeless people and prevent an epidemic. `` This is the worst flood in the history of <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>,'' President <PERSON> Hussain </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ershad </PERSON> said to about 300 men, women and children huddled in front of him on a narrow embankment surrounded by brown water. A soldier doled out scoops of uncooked rice and <PERSON> Ershad </PERSON> told the people more food would be found. Floods have submerged three-fourths of the country in the past 10 days and 12 smaller rivers were reported still rising Tuesday, although the <LOCATION> Ganges </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brahmaputra </LOCATION> and Meghna receded. The flooding began in June with the monsoon season, then abated and resumed last month. At least 412 people have been killed since June, according to government figures, but that number is considered too low. Daily death reports in <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION> newspapers, including 32 people who drowned when a ferry sank in the <LOCATION> Pabna </LOCATION> district 75 miles west of the capital, put the total at 1,154. Illness from flood-polluted water is increasing. The government health control center reported 10,000 new cases of diarrhea Tuesday, bringing the total to 102,000, and said 79 people had died of it. Those totals include only cases in areas that still can communicate with <LOCATION> Dacca </LOCATION>. Information Minister <PERSON> Mahbubur </PERSON> <PERSON> Rahman </PERSON> said Sunday that 21 million people were homeless. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has committed nearly $ 3.6 million to <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> flood relief, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday. Disaster management experts will be sent to <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION> to help assess the situation and advise on further assistance, the agency Ataul <PERSON> Karim </PERSON>, ambassador to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, said Tuesday in an interview with CBS: `` It's totally unprecedented. ... It's an aberration of nature. In 24 hours the whole country went under water. There is hardly any high ground anywhere.'' He said 28 million people were homeless. <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> is a region of deltas for rivers that rush down from the Himalayas during the annual monsoon rains. <PERSON> Erling </PERSON> <PERSON> Dessau </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION>, said: `` There should not be 110 million people living here. I think nature should have been left to itself.'' The government says it is too early to assess total damage or how much money will be needed for food supplies and reconstruction. <PERSON> Ershad </PERSON> said during a tour of flooded areas by helicopter and motor launch, however, that the cost of restoring roads and rail lines alone will be $ 156 million. He and other government officials have said <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> needs 3 million tons of grain from abroad. `` We will have to feed the people for two months at least,'' <PERSON> Ershad </PERSON> said in a brief chat with reporters during the tour Tuesday. Floods came at the worst time for food production in <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>, which was East <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> until 1971. It became independent after a civil war in which <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> supported the rebels. Half its annual production of 16.5 million tons of rice was in the ground when rice paddies across the country were inundated. <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> has three rice-growing seasons each year, but the current one normally produces the most and the projected yield had been 8 million tons. The government says at least 2 million tons will be lost. An old farmer who approached <PERSON> Ershad </PERSON> during a stop at <LOCATION> Bailtali </LOCATION>, 55 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION>, said: `` We may save part of the crop'' if the water is gone soon, but `` if the water stays more than seven days, it is all lost.'' Government warehouses held about 1.3 million tons of rice when the floods began. A military officer familiar with the storage facilities said water had seeped into many warehouses but the extent of damage was not known. When a helicopter following <PERSON> Ershad </PERSON>'s flew over a rice warehouse at <LOCATION> Takerhat </LOCATION>, 75 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION>, water covered the four long sheds up to their roofs. It was evident water was draining from some areas. Bright green blades of rice plants poked above the surface in paddies that had been submerged 24 hours earlier. At <LOCATION> Rajbari </LOCATION>, a town of 50,000 people 45 miles west of <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION>, men and women stood in chest-deep water as <PERSON> Ershad </PERSON> arrived in a motor launch. Rice paddies on the edge of town were under even deeper water. A boatman used his bamboo pole to measure the depth and it showed about 8 feet. Three miles away, 2,000 people took refuge on a road embankment when their villages were flooded. <PERSON> Shamsul </PERSON> <PERSON> Haq </PERSON>, a 35-year-old weaver from <LOCATION> Bagmara </LOCATION>, a village half a mile away, said he built a raft of bamboo poles to take his wife and two children to the embankment. He said his mud and straw house was under water but he would rebuild it. He said the loom with which he earns his living also was under water, but it would dry. <PERSON> Haq </PERSON> said he had nowhere else to go, even though his house also was flooded last year and might be flooded next year. Population density in <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> is about 2,000 people per square mile and per capita annual income of $ 150 puts it among the world's poorest nations.

 Food and water poisoning killed three people and hospitalized more than 150 in two separate incidents, police said Tuesday. They said 53 victims were poisoned by eating meat sandwiches late Monday at a restaurant in the northern port of <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION>. `` Most of the 53 ... came in screaming from severe stomach aches,'' said a nurse at a <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION> hospital. `` Later they started fainting and than three died.

In south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, more than 100 people were hospitalized Tuesday after drinking from an artesian well in the village of <LOCATION> Rzai </LOCATION>, 15 miles northeast of the ancient port city of Tyre, police reported. `` The poisoning is due to an overdose of chlorine used to purify the well's water,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Saarour </PERSON> at Tyre's government hospital. Sources at the <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> said medical and other supplies would be sent to Tyre to help cope with the emergency.

 The Dukakis-Bentsen campaign on Tuesday gave a preview of of a television ad touting the Democrats' efforts to win a plant closing notification law. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Cosgrove </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> campaign director for the presidential ticket of <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, said the Democrats' commercial reflects an emphasis on `` the future of the economy in this country.

 An American couple recovering from burns suffered during an air show crash in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> said Tuesday they still wonder how they survived, and vowed never to attend another aerobatic exhibition. Air Force Sgt. <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> McCanch </PERSON>, 23, his wife, <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON> <PERSON> McCanch </PERSON>, 21, and their 28-month-old son, <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON>, are among a group of Americans being treated at the burn unit of <ORGANIZATION> Brooke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. Fifty-three people died and several hundred others were injured after three Italian jets crashed during a demonstration at <ORGANIZATION> Ramstein </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, on Aug. 28. <PERSON> McCanch </PERSON> said he and his family were sitting together when the crash occurred and that parts of the aircraft landed about 30 feet near them. The McCanchs were burned on their hands, but their son, who was asleep on the ground at the time, was burned on his face, neck, back, legs and chest. `` It was just like a nightmare,'' Ms. <PERSON> McCanch </PERSON> said. `` When I was laying there on the ground ... I just kept on saying, ` This is not real. It's not happening.'' Both <PERSON> McCanches </PERSON> said they would never go to another air show as spectators, but disagreed on whether air shows should be banned. `` I do n't think there is a purpose for them,'' said Ms. <PERSON> McCanch </PERSON>, whose parents live in <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind </LOCATION>. But her husband, who is assigned to bomb disposal unit at <ORGANIZATION> Kapaun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Station </ORGANIZATION> near <LOCATION> Ramstein </LOCATION>, said the public is interested in the expensive aircraft. `` It shows the public the capabilities of the aircraft,'' he said. <PERSON> McCanch </PERSON> said that he was trying to take pictures with a small camera when he saw the aircraft collide. He said the impact knocked them several feet away from their son and he had to race back to pick him up. After their son's condition stabilized, the three were flown to the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> burn unit. The boy had a skin graft Tuesday. `` He's doing fine. He sees us all the time.

 The Drug Enforcement Administration's chief administrative law judge Tuesday recommended legalizing marijuana as a prescription drug for treatment of multiple sclerosis and nausea suffered by cancer patients in chemotherapy. The judge, <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, found that `` marijuana, in its natural form, is one of the safest therapeutically active substances known to man.'' `` By any measure of rational analysis, marijuana can be safely used within a supervised routine of medical care,'' <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said in a 68-page set of recommendations and findings. `` The judge realizes that strong emotions are aroused on both sides of any discussion concerning the use of marijuana,'' he said. `` Nonetheless it is essential for this agency, and its administrator, calmly and dispassionately to review the evidence of record, correctly to apply the law, and act accordingly.'' The recommendation is not binding on the <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION>'s administrator, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawn </PERSON>, who must make a final decision on whether to place marijuana on Schedule II, the list of drugs that can be given to patients with a doctor's prescription. Young rejected as `` specious'' the argument that medicinal use of marijuana would encourage its use as a recreational drug. `` The fear of sending such a signal can not be permitted to override the legitimate need, amply demonstrated in this record, of countless sufferers for the relief marijuana can provide when prescribed by a physician in a legitimate case.'' `` Marijuana can be harmful,'' <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said. `` Marijuana is abused. But the same is true of dozens of drugs or substances which are listed in Schedule II so that they can be employed in treatment by physicians in proper cases, despite their abuse potential.'' <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Zeese </PERSON>, an attorney for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> for the <ORGANIZATION> Reform </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marijuana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laws </ORGANIZATION>, which has sued to have marijuana placed on Schedule II, called the decision `` a very important step in the process.'' `` While it is not binding, we hope that the <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> will look at it fresh and take the facts and reach a sensible conclusion,'' <PERSON> Zeese </PERSON> said. The decision by Lawn or his successor will be reviewed by the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> here, which in 1980 ordered <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> to conduct hearings. The appellate court, which had twice previously remanded the issue to <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION>, has been critical of the agency's handling of the 16-year-old case, <PERSON> Zeese </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Cornelius </PERSON> <PERSON> Dougherty </PERSON> said Lawn `` wo n't have any comment until he has had a chance to look at'' Young's report. <PERSON> Dougherty </PERSON> said both sides have 20 days to file exceptions to <PERSON> Young </PERSON>'s findings. Before making a final decision on the case, <PERSON> Lawn </PERSON> could opt to hold additional hearings, he said. Young cited the testimony of doctors and patients during 11 days of hearings as evidence to conclude that marijuana is a medically accepted treatment for multiple sclerosis, hyperparathyroidism and the nausea suffered by some cancer patients who undergo chemotherapy. Young found that marijuana cigarettes were more effective at controlling nausea than capsules containing synthetic tetrahydrocannabinol, or THC, the chemically active ingredient of cannabis. When smoked, `` natural marijuana is inhaled and generally takes effect more quickly than the synthetic capsule which is ingested and must be processed through the digestive system before it takes effect,'' <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said. The opinion also cited efforts by several states _ including <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> _ to experiment with marijuana as medicine. Between 1979 and 1986, patients in at least 10 <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> hospitals smoked marijuana cigarettes supplied by the federal government under an experimental state program that showed it was `` highly effective'' in controlling nausea, he said. <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>'s effort to make marijuana available to cancer patients was frustrated by federal insistence that doctors use the drug only in a research program, <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said. The administrative law judge made no recommendation for marijuana's use to treat glaucoma, saying the petitioners had failed to produce sufficient evidence that `` a respectable minority of physicians'' supported their view that marijuana is an effective treatment for glaucoma, a disease that attacks the optic nerve and eventually causes blindness. But <PERSON> Young </PERSON> noted that `` two highly qualified and experienced ophthalmologists'' have accepted marijuana as a drug to treat glaucoma. He also noted that there are only a limited number of drugs available to treat the disease and all produce side effects, many of them serious. The placement of marijuana on Schedule II would n't automatically make it available as a prescription drug. Young noted that state and federal agencies, such as the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, would have to pass further judgment. Marijuana is currently a Schedule I drug along with heroin, PCP, and LSD. Its possession carries federal and state criminal penalties. Under federal law, simple possession of small amounts of marijuana carries a penalty of up to a year in prison and a $ 5,000 fine. The law carries stiffer penalties for possession of larger quantities where prosecutors can prove there was an intent to sell the drug.

<TEXT>
 The government said Tuesday the promised `` round table'' talks with workers will begin this month but gave no indication it would grant the main demand, legalizing Solidarity. Government spokesman <PERSON> Jerzy </PERSON> <PERSON> Urban </PERSON> said supporters of the outlawed free trade union movement should join existing official unions and try to reshape them from within. The official union federation, called OPZZ, said it would oppose allowing new unions into plants where it is established. Solidarity founder <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, who persuaded workers to stop striking in return for the negotiations, declared `` Let them talk,'' but also said such statements `` could destroy the round table.'' An OPZZ resolution said Premier <PERSON> Zbigniew </PERSON> <PERSON> Messner </PERSON>'s government should resign. Its leaders have said government officials should be held personally accountable for economic problems that led to a nationwide wave of strikes last month. Numerous signs in the official press and in speeches at a party conference last month have pointed to changes in the government at the next parliament session, which is expected this month. Such a shakeup would not affect the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leadership, which holds the real power. Urban said at his first news conference since the strikes ended Saturday that talks with <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> and other worker delegates will start this month and include several dozen people. He said the government wants the meetings to begin as soon as possible after preparatory work is finished, but also said they will be canceled automatically if any more `` political'' strikes occur. Talks will cover speeding economic reform, reaching a national consensus for reform, improving living standards and democratizing <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, he said. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> talked supporters into ending the strikes last week after getting a commitment from Interior Minister <PERSON> Czeslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON> for negotiations whose topics would include Solidarity. The first independent trade union in the Soviet bloc was born in the labor turmoil of 1980 at the <LOCATION> Lenin </LOCATION> shipyard in <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> works as an electrician. Gen. <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>'s government imposed martial law in December 1981 to suppress Solidarity and outlawed it the next year Asked about Solidarity's demand for a return to legal status, Urban said that allowing two trade unions in one plant was unacceptable. `` If followers of some tendency connected in the past with Solidarity are a majority in a given plant, then they can either join the -LRB- official -RRB- trade union, outnumbering it and directing it where they wish, or form a coalition, a compromise body'' with the official union. `` The existing legal rules offer a broad scope of possibilities,'' he said, and Solidarity activists made a `` historical mistake'' in boycotting the new government unions created in 1982 after Solidarity was outlawed. Urban said a pro-Solidarity union could be formed in a plant where no union existed, but would not be permitted to use the name Solidarity `` in the present legal situation.'' Reached at home in <LOCATION> Gdansk </LOCATION> after Urban's news conference, <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said: `` Let them talk. But they should remember that they could destroy the round table by such irresponsible statements. This is all I can say.'' Solidarity activists say they want their own union, not membership in the unions established by the government under martial law.

 Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, declaring Republicans have provided good jobs at good wages, was angrily booed and jeered Tuesday by hard-hat shipyard workers chanting, `` Union buster, union buster'' and `` Go home, <PERSON> George </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> encountered the hostile reaction from boilermakers, pipefitters, laborers and electricians during a speech at the Northwest Marine Iron Works. Trying to win votes in a state where he acknowledged he trailed Democratic rival <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` Do not gamble on another liberal Democrat coming out of nowhere.'' He told the crowd of several hundred, `` Do n't listen to all this <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> stuff. They're on the ropes and they've got to make all this noise.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> appeared to have a smattering of support in the audience and was able to win a few cheers when he said he supported the death penalty for drug kingpins and for criminals who kill police officers. The workers also applauded when <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> declared his opposition to furlough programs for prison inmates. However, the audience was largely unfriendly. One prominent sign read, `` Union busting, scab-loving <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>.'' Several people shouted obscenities at <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> during his speech. The vice president said the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration had brought the prime interest rate down from 21 percent and had slashed inflation. He said, `` We're making progress for the working man and women in this country.'' He pledged anew never to raise taxes _ drawing some applause _ and urged the crowd to `` get that same pledge out of the Democrats.'' Opening a two-state swing _ taking him later to <PERSON> Everett </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, another state where <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he was trailing _ he said his goal was to provide a good job at a good wage for everyone who wanted one. `` Good jobs at good wages'' is a main <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign theme. When <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> credited the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration with providing 18 million new jobs over the past six years, the audience booed. `` I know the truth sometimes hurts,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. At times he appeared combative and did not flinch from the heated encounter. When tensions seemed high at one point, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said `` little drama'' and pulled out a 1950 union card showing that he was a dues-paying member of the steelworkers then. `` The Democrats are trying to mislead you, predicting gloom and doom,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` It's quite simple: The other party wo n't get elected unless things get worse, and things are n't going to get worse unless they get elected.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was looking for problems in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s `` new-found American strength. The ice president also said of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, `` It's all a mistake, he'll tell you. Quick, before it's too late, we'd better get serious, he'll tell you, and return to the policies of <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>. `` We just can not go back and lose the progress that we've made in this country.'' After his speech, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> bought a sandwich from a lunch truck and ate it during a meeting with some of the workers. One of them challenged him to explain why his wages have gone from $ 13.36 to $ 9.50 per hour during the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. `` You're going through a competitive change,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, referring to the foreign challenge to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> shipyards. Over lunch, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> appeared unperturbed by the crowd's reaction. `` All I need is 51 percent of the vote,'' he said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, en route from a campaign appearance in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s comments reflected an inability to comprehend the needs of the average American. `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> made it clear today that he really does not understand the hopes and dreams and aspiration of millions and millions of American workers across this country,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` That's not an adequate answer to American workers.'' Later in the day, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> got a decidedly different welcome from an audience at a non-union manufacturing plant in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. A crowd of about 500 people at the <ORGANIZATION> Fluke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which specializes in electronic instruments, gave the vice president a warm, polite reception as he spoke about jobs and the economy. `` Incomes are rising, unemployment is falling and I'll tell ` ya, things are on the move in this country,'' he said `` Some do n't want us to believe that things are getting better in this country,'' the vice president said. `` My opponent is one of them, frankly.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and his staff said they were not upset by the reception earlier in <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>. `` You're talking to people you've got to convert. I think we converted a few,'' said <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s chief of staff. For his part, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told the lunchroom crowd of workers earlier, `` You do n't let them rattle you. It's like being a baseball player when you're out there, 3-and-2, the bases loaded, two runs behind and somebody begins yelling out. You ca n't stop concentrating on what you're doing.'' In <PERSON> Everett </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> used an interview with newspaper and broadcast correspondents to urge both side in the race not to disrupt the campaign. `` I'd like to use this forum right here to appeal to my supporters and his to at least let people speak without harassing. But when it happens you do n't need to get all uptight about it and act like you're being put upon because this is the way it works at this level of politics,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. On Air Force Two, carrying him to <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> accused <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> of running a negative campaign. `` He has to tear down. He has to make everything negative to be elected. I do n't have to be responding to him.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' contention Tuesday that the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has been anti-union was a `` stupid charge.'' Even though polls show that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has largely erased <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' once-large lead, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` I'm campaigning as the underdog Being even is like being the underdog as far as I'm concerned.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was next flying to <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>, Ky, to make a speech Wednesday before the American Legion.

 Anti-abortion demonstrators disrupted a speech Tuesday by Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> to Polish-American supporters, some of whom physically ejected a few of the protesters in a melee of pushing and shoving. Some punches were thrown, but police said there were no arrests in the incident, the most serious in a series of anti-abortion protests at appearances by the Democratic presidential nominee in recent weeks. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, after the interruption at the start of his speech at a banquet hall in this <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> suburb, delivered his prepared remarks in which he emphasized economic themes and said his <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> rivals `` love to blame American workers first.'' He ridiculed Republican presidential nominee <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for saying last fall that <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> automakers could use the abilities of Soviet tank mechanics. `` He said the American auto industry could use a few good mechanics from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> who could teach our workers something about quality,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` Do you really believe we in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> have anything to learn from a society where workers have no rights, consumers have no choices, and even Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> admits their economy is a shambles?'' `` Those Republicans in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> love to blame American workers first,'' he said. Last fall, during a trip to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he'd been told in a meeting of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> ministers that 350 Soviet tanks had completed maneuvers without a breakdown. `` Hey, when the mechanics who keep those tanks running run out of work in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, send them to <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> because we could use that kind of ability,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said at the time. Later, he apologized to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> autoworkers, adding, `` Hey give me a break; I did n't mean anything by it.'' Following his appearance, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> told reporters that protests such as the one he faced were to be expected. `` It's a democracy and those of us in public life know from time to time that there are going to be people who may tend to be a little loud and disruptive,'' he said. `` I just hope as the campaign goes on we can address the real issues that face the campaign and that face the country and do so in a way that's respectful of each other.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> repeated his position that he opposes abortion but that `` in the last analysis it's up to the woman in the exercise of her own conscience and religious beliefs to make that decision.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> ran into trouble of a different sort when he tried to leave <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> for a campaign event in <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> officials pulled a surprise safety inspection of his chartered <ORGANIZATION> Presidential </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737, grounding him in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. He canceled the <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION> appearance and flew back to <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> on his backup plane, accompanied by as many news people as the plane could hold. After landing in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> told reporters that the timing of the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION>'s spot inspection was `` very curious,'' but declined to comment further. Campaign spokesman <PERSON> Dayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON> said the inspection could have been performed overnight, `` not 15 minutes before we were supposed to leave.'' Later, he added, `` We're looking forward to the moment in January when he gets to name the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> administrator.'' <PERSON> Stan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivers </PERSON>, acting administrator for the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> regional office in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, said, `` It's not a new policy. It goes on in every campaign.'' During the speech disruption earlier, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> told the protesters, `` I respect your right to disagree with me. That's what a democracy is all about. ... I would hope you would respect my right to speak.'' When the demonstrators refused to quiet down, a half dozen or so were forced out of the crowd of some 1,000 people. In the back of the room protesters and others in the crowd scuffled. Several punches were thrown at the protesters. The people who evicted the protesters did not appear to be security personnel, and campaign spokeman <PERSON> Dayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON> said they were not campaign workers. <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> agents protecting <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> did not move toward the protests. Just as <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was about to begin, the protesters had shouted `` What about abortion?'' The crowd tried to drown them out by chanting `` We want <PERSON> Mike </PERSON>.'' As <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> tried to proceed, other protesters shouted `` You're a baby killer.'' One protester, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON>, 46, of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, said members of several area anti-abortion groups met a week ago to plan protests of any <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> events. `` If <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is within 300 miles of a pro-life activist, they're going to go out and greet him,'' he said. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Scheidler </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Pro-Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>, said the group obtained tickets to the event from the Democrats, `` and we decided we were going to inject the issue of abortion whenever it seemed relevant.'' One spectator obviously upset by the demonstators, <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> <PERSON> Reis </PERSON>, said he opposes abortion and has donated money to pro-life groups. He said he would make no further donations, adding, `` I think they're full of hate, not full of love.'' There seemed to be only a handful of protesters inside the hall and perhaps 20 or 30 outside. One day earlier, more than 100 demonstrators chanted as <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> met outdoors with residents of a <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> neighborhood. Other groups of similar protesters have shown up to heckle him but previously had not delayed him from speaking. On Tuesday, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> also met in private with <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> leaders, not including <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> who was said to be upset about that omission. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' state press secretary, <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Erwin </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was not included in the meetings because he is regarded as a national leader and Tuesday's meetings were to focus on the <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> state campaign. In <LOCATION> Niles </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> paid tribute to the Polish trade movement Solidarity and its leader, <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, saying the Polish government `` must engage in a productive dialogue'' with the union. `` Solidarity must be recognized,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> repeated his economic themes that contend the American middle class has been caught in an economic squeeze, with declining buying power and stagnant wages, during the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration.

 In an appearance before the American Legion, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> described the Democrats as advocating `` a <ORGANIZATION> Disneyland </ORGANIZATION> defense policy'' and embodying `` the liberal ideology of decline and retreat.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, returning to the White House from a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> vacation, stopped in <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, to address the Legion convention. `` Yes, it comes down to this: After eight hard years of rebuilding <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s strength, do we really want to return to a <LOCATION> Disneyland </LOCATION> defense policy _ with <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Mouse </PERSON> treatment of our men and women in uniform, Goofy strategic plans and <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Duck-like </PERSON> lectures telling us that whatever goes wrong is our own blankety-blank fault?'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> asked. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said the Democrats were promoting a `` hit list'' of cancellations and delays for the MX missile, the B-1 bomber, the Trident submarine missile and two proposed carrier battle groups for the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>. `` To that they've added nearly every major new weapons system to become prominent on the scene since the last liberal administration went to its reward, including the Midgetman missile, the Stealth bomber and our Strategic Defense Initiative,'' he said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, however, has said he supports the advanced D-5 Trident missile and continued development of the Stealth bomber, so-called because of its ability to escape radar detection.

 The heckling in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> was some of the most intense either candidate has faced during the campaign. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> also had transportation troubles, being forced to cancel an appearance in <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, when a surprise <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> safety inspection of his campaign plane prevented his scheduled departure from <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. Campaign spokesman <PERSON> Dayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON> complained that `` our plane has been parked here since last night and surely, if our plane needed to be inspected, it would have been convenient for us to have it done last night, not 15 minutes before we were supposed to leave.''

It goes on in every campaign.'' Meanwhile, agreement appeared set for three debates this fall _ two between the presidential candidates and one between the vice presidential nominees. Agreement still had not been reached on timing and format, said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign chairman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Brountas </PERSON> after a telephone conversation with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign chairman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>. <PERSON> Brountas </PERSON> said he and <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> would talk again Wednesday. Democratic vice presidential nominee <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> ran into some partisan heckling from <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> supporters at <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Polytechnic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. The hecklers confronted <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> at an outdoor rally at the college after the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> senator delivered an education speech. They carried signs that read `` <PERSON> Duke </PERSON> <PERSON> Buster </PERSON>'' and `` Avoid the Lloyd.'' At the <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION> shipyard, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was booed when he said 18 million new jobs were created during the past six years of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. `` I know the truth sometimes hurts,'' he said. The crowd chanted, `` Union buster,'' but <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> contined to speak in a loud voice, telling the workers: `` The Democrats are trying to mislead you. ... Things are n't going to get worse unless they get elected.'' Many of the workers carried anti-Bush signs that accused him of being anti-union. One read: `` Union Busting, Scab-Loving <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>.'' Later in the day, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> got a decidedly different welcome from an audience at a non-union manufacturing plant in <LOCATION> Everett </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>. A crowd of about 500 people at the <ORGANIZATION> Fluke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which specializes in electronic instruments, gave the vice president a warm, polite reception as he spoke about jobs and the economy <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was speaking to a Polish-American audience when protesters shouted `` What about abortion?''

The <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign was beginning its first nationwide advertising with a new television ad beginning Tuesday night or Wednesday, said <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON>, the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> spokesman. <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON> said he did n't know how much was spent on ads.

 Dictator <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> went unattended by doctors for at least 14 hours after he suffered a fatal stroke in 1953 because his security chief refused to let anyone summon physicians, according to an Estonian newspaper. <ORGANIZATION> Sovietskaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Estonia </ORGANIZATION> said in an edition that arrived in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> Tuesday that <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s bodyguards found him incapacitated on the floor of his country residence but <PERSON> Lavrenti </PERSON> <PERSON> Beria </PERSON> insisted <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> was sleeping. No one dared contradict <PERSON> Beria </PERSON> and <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> was left unattended until the next day, the newspaper reported in its Sunday edition. <PERSON> Beria </PERSON> became head of the secret police in 1938 and carried out bloody purges during the <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> era. The newspaper said its report was based partly on an account recently given to it by a retired security officer, <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rykov </PERSON>, who claimed he was present at <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s dacha, or country home, when <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> died. <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> had ruled since 1924. Little official information was given about his death in March 1953 and his final days have been a mystery to historians. <LOCATION> Sovietskaya </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION> gave this version: <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> probably died several days before March 5, 1953, the day his death was announced and that given officially as the date of death. <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> died at his dacha and not in the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>, as official reports said. An autopsy showed <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> suffered a series of small strokes in his final years that affected `` parts of the brain responsible for psychotic activities.'' It took more than six months to embalm and preserve the body before it was put on public display. The newspaper said <PERSON> Rykov </PERSON>, who retired as a major, served as a guard at <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s dacha and recently entered the paper's editorial department and offered to tell his story. `` He could talk for hours about ` the leader of the people,' saving every little fact in his memory,'' the report said. It quoted <PERSON> Rykov </PERSON> was as saying <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> went to bed at 4 a.m. on March 1, 1953, after guests had left. `` In the afternoon guards noticed there was no movement in <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s study or other rooms, but at 6:30 p.m. a light was turned on in the study and in the hall,'' <PERSON> Rykov </PERSON> said, according to the newspaper. It quoted him as saying no one summoned the guards, who became concerned; when one went in to deliver a letter <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> was lying on the carpet in the dining room having `` obvious difficulties in saying anything. Other guards came into the room and carried <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> into the largest hall. It could be seen that he was cold, and he probably was on the floor three to four hours without any help.'' The account said <PERSON> Beria </PERSON> and <PERSON> Georgi </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Malenkov </PERSON>, a close aide who briefly succeeded <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> as top leader, arrived at 3 a.m. on March 2 after <PERSON> Beria </PERSON> telephoned instructions that no one was to say anything about <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s condition. After seeing the unconscious leader, <PERSON> Beria </PERSON> insisted the guards had panicked and that `` <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> was simply sleeping,'' according to the report. Doctors finally were summoned, apparently by <PERSON> Nikita </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON> who won a power struggle to become <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief later in 1953, and they arrived between 9 a.m. and 10 a.m. `` The doctors were so nervous they could not even take off <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s shirt,'' <PERSON> Rykov </PERSON> was quoted as saying. `` It had to be cut through with scissors. The diagnosis was brain hemorrhage. Treatment was attempted, but it was not surgical. What surgeon could take responsibility for <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s life, especially when <PERSON> Beria </PERSON> frightened everybody, asking whether they could guarantee that <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s life could be preserved?'' <PERSON> Beria </PERSON> was arrested in July 1953 and charged with conspiracy against the state. After a secret trial he and six alleged accomplices where shot in December 1953. The newspaper article described the evening of March 5, 1953, when <PERSON> S.S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Debov </PERSON>, who had embalmed the body of Soviet founder <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON>, was summoned. `` One of <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s cars took <PERSON> Debov </PERSON> to <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s postmortem examination, which showed some irreversible changes localized in parts of the brain responsible for psychotic activities, which were caused by a number of small hemorrhages,'' <PERSON> Rykov </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s funeral was held on March 9 and the body carried to the tomb. The mausoleum was closed for more than eight months for a more permanent embalming procedure. `` On Nov. 17, 1953, the mausoleum was opened for the people with <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> lying together,'' the newspaper said. It reported the identical coffins remained side by side until 8:25 p.m. on Oct. 31, 1961, when soldiers took <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s remains to a plain gravesite nearby but outside the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> wall. <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON> had begun his campaign against what he called the cult of <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>.

 Foreign ministers of nations that profess non-alignment welcomed the world's improved political climate, but were less optimistic Tuesday about its economic prospects. `` The international crisis still persists and a number of economic and financial problems remain unresolved with prospects of progress gloomy,'' spokesman <PERSON> Nicos </PERSON> <PERSON> Agathocleous </PERSON> said. A draft statement on the international economy will be presented for approval to the four-day ministers' conference, which President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Vassiliou </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> will open Wednesday. <PERSON> Agathocleous </PERSON> said the draft statement emphasized that, though there are political developments, particularly between the two superpowers, offering new possibilities of strengthening international cooperation, regrettably the same is not true about the world economic situation.'' A copy obtained by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> deals in detail with 30 issues, ranging from establishment of a new economic order to foreign debt, world hunger, relations between rich and poor nations and global economic cooperation. The draft `` expresses profound concern'' about lack of progress on almost all issues covered. It says problems in the world economy and links between nations make it `` all the more urgent that both the developed and the developing countries engage in construtive dialogue.'' This should be `` aimed at finding common solutions to the problems currently confronting the international economy, including the reform of the international monetary, financial and trading systems in the interest of both the developed and the developing countries,'' the draft declares. Another committee is considering a statement on 39 international political issues, with emphasis on the Palestinian and South African problems. <PERSON> Agathocleous </PERSON> said the 60-page political document, prepared by <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> as the host country, is much shorter than drafts submitted to previous conferences. Delegations from 92 out of non-aligned movement's 101 members are to attend the four-day meting, including 70 foreign ministers. The <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, which seeks to turn sympathy for the 9-month-old Palestinian uprising in the Israeli-occupied lands to its political advantage, is expected to win wide support and possibly financial backing. That would give a significant boost to <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s effort to form a provisional government for an independent Palestinian state.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> accused the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ticket Tuesday of harboring `` a <ORGANIZATION> Disneyland </ORGANIZATION> defense policy'' that would strip the nation of its military strength and threaten the advances he has made in arms control. Acting as <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s chief surrogate on the campaign trail, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> used some of his harshest rhetoric in weeks to lambast the vice president's opponents in an address to the 70th national convention of the American Legion. The president entered the post-Labor Day election fray during a stop en route to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> following a three-week <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> vacation. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> never mentioned Democratic presidential nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> by name, but he made clear he thinks the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor embodies the `` liberal ideology of decline and retreat'' and leads a party that has shown `` remarkable passivity'' and `` unbelievable indecision'' in defense matters while it controlled the White House. In doing so, the president attempted to paint <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as inexperienced in world and military affairs, while hoping to woo into <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s corner those conservative Democrats who twice had voted for his own `` peace through strength'' stand. Using a comic-book analogy to make his point, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> quipped, `` When it comes to defense, the liberal agenda hides behind heroic rhetoric. But this liberal agenda is no Superman; it's no <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> <PERSON> Kent </PERSON>; it's <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Olson </PERSON> trying to impress his date.'' He charged the Democrats with promoting a `` hit list'' of cancellations and delays for the MX missile, the B-1 bomber, the Trident submarine missile and two proposed carrier battle groups for the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>. `` To that they've added nearly every major new weapons system to become prominent on the scene since the last liberal administration went to its reward, including the Midgetman missile, the Stealth bomber and our Strategic Defense Initiative,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, however, has said he supports the advanced D-5 Trident missile and continued development of the Stealth bomber, so-called because of its ability to escape radar detection. The president accused the Democrats of planning to start `` a unilateral <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> moratorium on underground nuclear testing and a ban on flight testing of missiles.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said that while <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s opponents have praised him for reaching a treaty with the Soviets banning intermediate-range nuclear weapons in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, they also `` opposed deploying the missiles that made that treaty possible ...'' `` They want to conclude more arms reduction treaties, but would cancel or delay the weapons systems on which successful negotiations will depend. ... They profess their devotion to <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> but would diminish the role of the very nuclear forces that <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> needs to deter the Soviets. Does that make any sense as military strategy?'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> asked. `` Yes, it comes down to this: After eight hard years of rebuilding <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s strength, do we really want to return to a <LOCATION> Disneyland </LOCATION> defense policy _ with <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Mouse </PERSON> treatment of our men and women in uniform, Goofy strategic plans and <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Duck-like </PERSON> lectures telling us that whatever goes wrong is our own blankety-blank fault?'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> asked. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> contended that even the Soviets might prefer his own approach to that of any Democrat. `` Again and again around the world, our predecessors had shown not the slightest grasp of the fundamentals of strategy and national interest ... And it even came to be said that the Soviets longed for strong, consistent leadership in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, capable of making a deal and sticking to it,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. He derided <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' proposals for boosting conventional forces, which he has dubbed a `` conventional defense initiative,'' in contrast to the president's anti-missile strategic defense program. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> contended a buildup of conventional forces is `` well under way'' and that without the recent achievement of laser-guided munitions, `` we would not have been able to stage our successful strike against -LRB- <PERSON> Moammar </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>.'' The president went on to boast how successful his policies have been. `` And our reward is that from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, we are bringing peace to long-raging conflicts, even as we frustrate Soviet aims,'' he contended. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> repeated his oft-used claim that he's `` not given up one square inch of land to communism ... And yet today relations between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> are the best they've been in decades. He told his audience, composed of some 7,000 veterans and their families, that he was proud of the military buildup he'd pledged to achieve eight years ago. `` Today I stand before you to report, ` Mission accomplished,''' he said. The Legionnaires interrupted the president frequently with applause. However, on the sidewalk outside the convention hall, about two dozen demonstrators held up signs urging support for the Equal Rights Amendment and opposing the president's policy of aid to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s Contra rebels. Before addressing the Legion, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> stopped briefing at <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Hastings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, where he participated in dedication ceremonies of a communications arts center. The center is named for the parents of public relations executive <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, a former resident of <PERSON> Hastings </PERSON> and long-time <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> acquaintance who had served as the communications director on the the president's 1980 White House campaign.

 President <PERSON> Saddam </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> on Tuesday accused <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> of starting the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> war and stalling the cease-fire talks in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. Also Tuesday, the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> government declared an amnesty for anti-government Kurds and gave those outside the country 30 days to return. The amnesty decree by the <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> covered `` all Iraqi Kurds who have committed any crime punishable by law whether they are outside or inside the country.'' But a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Kurdish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, the main guerrilla group, said it will not use the amnesty without guarantees that prisoners will be released and returnees will be allowed to resettle in their original villages. `` This amnesty has come too late,'' said the spokesman in a telephone interview with The Associated Press in <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>. `` When people have lost their homes or their villages or their sons in these chemical bombardments, what would they accept an amnesty for?'' Kurdish rebels have charged that <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, after the start of the Aug. 20 cease-fire with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, launched a massive assault on the Kurdish population in northern <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, using chemical weapons and 60,000 troops. The Kurds, backed by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, have been seeking an autonomous homeland that area of <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> referred briefly to the offensive, saying the operation was over. In his first major public speech since the Aug. 20 cease-fire in the gulf, <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has proof that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> started the hostilities. His address to a conference of Arab information ministers was broadcast on state-run television. `` Now I can reveal for the first time that we have Iranian pilots who were downed by <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> before September 4, 1980,'' he said. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> claims the war began on September 22 of that year when <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> launched a massive invasion. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> claims the war began on Sept. 4, when <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> shelled Iraqi towns and attacked Iraqi ships in the Shatt-al-Arab waterway. U.N.-mediated peace talks in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> have stalled, in part over <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s demand the waterway, its only outlet to the sea, be opened and cleared of sunken tankers. <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> insisted that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> is preventing progress at the talks. `` We did not ask for something unrealistic,'' he said. `` What we asked for is free navigation in the gulf and <PERSON> Shatt-al-Arab </PERSON>.'' The Shatt-al-Arab waterway, formed by the convergence of the <LOCATION> Tigris </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Euphrates </LOCATION> rivers, is located on the southern border between the two nations and is the the source of a 400-year-old dispute between <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said on Tuesday the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is `` very concerned about the human rights implications of <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s conduct toward civilians, and its campaign to suppress longstanding Kurdish rebellions.'' He said, however, <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> had no evidence <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> was engaged in chemical warfare against the Kurds.

 Democratic presidential nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was grounded Tuesday and had to cancel an <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> campaign stop after the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> sprung a surprise inspection of his chartered airplane and found safety problems with it. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> spent much of Tuesday afternoon at <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. He canceled a trip to <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, and returned to <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> on the press plane that accompanies his campaign. After landing in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> told reporters that the timing of the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION>'s spot inspection `` was very curious,'' but declined to comment further. Campaign press secretary <PERSON> Dayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON> said the inspection could have been performed overnight and added, `` we're looking forward to the moment in January when he gets to name the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> administrator.'' The misfortunes with campaign aircraft continued despite the grounding. As s reporters and staff disembarked from the media plane, a cone-shaped section at the rear fell to the ground, exposing the open cabin inside. The plane's pilot, who had invited <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> to sit in the jump seat of the cockpit during the landing, blamed the mishap on someone inside the plane who he said pulled a cable jettisoning the tail cone. The pilot, who declined to give his name, said the tail cone could not have come off during an actual flight. The <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737 that the candidate and his campaign staff had been using was taken out of service by <ORGANIZATION> Presidential </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> after an <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> inspector cited at least four problems with it. <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Fudala </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for <ORGANIZATION> Presidential </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION>, called the problems `` a couple of minor items'' that were corrected during the day. She said the plane was expected to fly to <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> and rejoin the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> said it did not actually ground the jet, but pointed out the problems _ including eight inches of peeling metal skin on a wing flap and a cabin door that would not seal properly. `` The captain elected to delay the flight so those could be fixed,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Fudala </PERSON> from the airline's headquarters in <LOCATION> Herndon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> called the inspection routine, but <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON> questioned why the aircraft, which had been at <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION> since Monday, could not have been examined earlier. `` Our plane has been parked here since last night and surely if our plane needed to be inspected it would have been more convenient for us to have it done last night, not 15 minutes before we were supposed to leave,'' he said. He said the campaign had been told that the order to inspect the plane came from officials at the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION>'s regional office in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mort </PERSON> <PERSON> Edelstein </PERSON>, a spokesman at the regional <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> office, said the agency `` is inspecting all candidate and press planes once every two weeks on average.'' In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrar </PERSON> said the `` ramp'' inspection, which consists of close visual inspection of the exterior and interior of the aircraft, was similar to those conducted in recent weeks on other planes chartered by the two presidential candidates. He said that between Aug. 23 and Aug. 26 the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> inspected two aircraft belonging to the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign and three hired by the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign including one carrying <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential candidate <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> travels on Air Force Two, which is closely inspected by the military. `` These were all ramp inspections. It is part of a deliberate program to keep close tabs on the safety of aircraft used by the political candidates,'' said <PERSON> Farrar </PERSON>. According to the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION>, the problems found on the Presidential Airways jet were: a delamination of metal skin on a wing flap; a bent stall-warning vane, the device that measures wind flow and triggers a warning if the aircraft is about to stall; pressurization problems with the left-front cabin door, and improperly working floor proximity lights.

 <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>' unions will argue their case against the carrier's elimination of 4,000 jobs in federal court this month, but employees Tuesday began receiving pink slips. An Eastern spokeswoman said the post-Labor Day layoffs are n't as dramatic as portrayed by union leaders. <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceremsak </PERSON> said many employees already have taken leaves of absences, early retirement or quit. Attorneys for the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union and <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> decided to first present their case against the layoffs in the appellate court. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Tuesday told <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> to submit legal briefs on its position by Sept. 12. A union response is due by Sept. 16, a reply from <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> is due three days later, and oral arguments in the case were scheduled for the morning of Sept. 26, Ms. <PERSON> Ceremsak </PERSON> said. The same court last Friday night dissolved an order by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Barrington </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> D.C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> had allowed <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> to cut 12 percent of its flights, including all service for 14 cities, but not lay off the workers. The appellate court allowed Eastern to make the layoffs after posting a $ 4.7 million bond to pay the employees if their jobs are reinstated after the court holds a full hearing. The company says the layoffs take effect Sept. 10. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union, has blasted the timing of the layoffs. `` It is typical of -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> Chairman -RRB- <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>'s style,'' <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> said. `` It's tragic for the employees to be faced with this kind of uncertainty on Labor Day and at the start of the school year.'' But <PERSON> Ceremsak </PERSON> said, `` There's no good time for a furlough. We had previously announced the furloughs July 22. It was the unions' court action that delayed them. She said of 1,000 flight attendant positions eliminated, nearly 400 flight attendants had taken leaves of absences that would last from one to six months, about 100 had taken early retirement or quit, and some 530 were furloughed. Of the 4,000 positions eliminated, 1,500 were non-union employees including management and clerical workers. Some 1,000 Machinists workers, which include mechanics, baggage handlers and ramp agents, will be laid off. Some of those workers will take early retirement, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> officials expected. The layoffs also called for elimination of 500 pilots' positions, but <ORGANIZATION> ALPA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> said no pilot layoffs were expected because of tremendous backlogs of vacation time The Miami-based carrier has said cutting labor costs is necessary to make the company profitable again, but unions have criticized the idea that scaling back will make the airline more money. Eastern officials say they want to concentrate on their traditionally strong Northeastern markets. But the unions contend that <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s parent company, is stripping the Miami-based carrier's assets in favor of its non-union sister carrier, <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>.

<TEXT>
 City officials paid a $ 192,000 fine Tuesday and, faced with million-dollar fines by the end of the week, pressed their efforts to end an impasse over court-ordered housing desegregation. Mayor <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Wasicsko </PERSON> told reporters it was possible that at least one of the four city councilmen blocking the housing plan may be near backing down. But later he said the prospects for a quick settlement did not appear good. `` I'm sorry to report that there has n't been any significant movement,'' he said. `` The court is standing firm but the councilmen say they want some concessions before they comply. The two sides are considerably far apart.'' <PERSON> Wasicsko </PERSON> said Councilmen <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Longo </PERSON> and <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Chema </PERSON> met with him and the city manager for 7 -LCB- hours Monday talking about services that would have to be cut to meet mounting fines. He noted that <PERSON> Chema </PERSON> represents an area of the city `` that is going to feel the brunt of the service cuts and tax increases very acutely, and yet that is an area where no housing is to be built.'' It is the proposed placement of subsidized housing in middle-class areas that fueled opposition to the plan. No meetings were scheduled Tuesday, but key figures in the crisis of the state's fourth-largest city were in touch by telephone. The mayor said he was in contact most of the day with <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> members, with the federal judge in the case and aides to Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION>. No breakthrough was reported from Monday's meetings. According to city Corporation Counsel <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickelle </PERSON>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Sand </PERSON> had said that if the <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> approved a housing plan Tuesday, he would forgive the $ 192,000 in fines accumulated over the weekend. <PERSON> Pickelle </PERSON> said there was `` a real financial incentive to reach a compromise today.'' But <LOCATION> Yonkers </LOCATION> spokesman <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Schoen </PERSON> said 12 hours notice is required before a legal meeting, and none was scheduled as of Tuesday morning. At issue is Sand's order that the council approve measures to promote the construction of 800 units of subsidized housing. Sand ruled in 1985 that the city was guilty of decades of intentional segregation of its schools and public housing. The schools were desegregated under a plan approved by Sand, and the <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> agreed in January to develop 1,000 units of housing. But under pressure from people who do n't want subsidized housing in their middle-class neighborhoods, four councilmen recanted and vowed to block the plan from going forward. Sand levied escalating fines against the city _ $ 100 for the first day and doubling every day after that. He also fined the recalcitrant councilmen. The penalties were stayed pending appeal. Last week, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> reinstated the fines against the city but continued the stay against any punishment of the councilmen. If the fines continue mounting through the week, <LOCATION> Yonkers </LOCATION> would owe $ 204,800 Wednesday. By Friday, the fines would reach $ 1 million a day; the city would be bankrupt by Nov. 12, according to city officials. Meanwhile Tuesday, the city announced details of a `` doomsday budget'' made necessary by the fines. The plan forsees a gradual reduction in city services, such as garbage collection, park maintenance and programs for senior citizens, youths and the handicapped. Cuts would continue until Thanksgiving, when all fire and police personnel would have been laid off, garbage collection would end and the city would cease to function. The mayor said that although formal cuts had not begun, 25 percent of <LOCATION> Yonkers </LOCATION>' scheduled garbage pickups were canceled Tuesday because of a lack of diesel fuel as the city limits fuel purchases. `` The garbage is piling up today, the libraries will be closed next week,'' the mayor said. `` It may take deep cuts in city services to get the people of <LOCATION> Yonkers </LOCATION> to tell their councilmen that they want this matter settled.''

 <LOCATION> Liberia </LOCATION> has charged two Americans with treason for allegedly plotting to overthrow the government and kill President <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Doe </PERSON>. One of the defendants is a former <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> sergeant. An indictment was returned Monday against the ex-serviceman, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, 40, of <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON> <PERSON> Elmer </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, 45, of <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J </LOCATION>.. Also charged in the indictment was <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, a Liberian who lived in exile in neighboring <LOCATION> Ivory </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> until his arrest in July The three are charged with illegally entering <LOCATION> Liberia </LOCATION> in July with the intent of staging a coup and killing <PERSON> Doe </PERSON>. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>' wife, <PERSON> Gwendolyn </PERSON>, said her husband was in the business of importing cement to <LOCATION> Liberia </LOCATION> and planned no wrongdoing when he traveled to the country. `` I feel that he's innocent because when he left here, he left on business,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, 30, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in a telephone interview from her home in <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. `` They happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>' name was given as <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Elmer </PERSON> <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON>, but Mrs. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said that was an error. Five members of the purported coup plot were killed in a July 13 clash with <LOCATION> Liberian </LOCATION> security men, including Liberian Maj. Gen. <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Podier </PERSON>, <PERSON> Doe </PERSON>'s former deputy and the plot's reported mastermind, the indictment says. The document identifies the others killed as ex-soldier <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Seekie </PERSON>, both Liberians. The indictment gave no details on Seekie and said the other two dead men have not been identified. The government said the coup plotters entered <LOCATION> Liberia </LOCATION> from the <LOCATION> Ivory </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> on July 10 near the village of <LOCATION> Gbolay </LOCATION>. They reportedly hid for three days in a forest, but were discovered by security forces on July 13 and a firefight ensued. `` The three defendants were overpowered while Podier, <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Seekie </PERSON> and two others presently unknown were killed as a result of the gunfire,'' the indictment said. <LOCATION> Liberia </LOCATION> was established in 1847 by former American slaves. <PERSON> Doe </PERSON>, then an army master sergeant, took power in an April 12, 1980 coup, overthrowing the government of <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Tolbert </PERSON> and killing the civilian leader.

<TEXT>
 A judge Tuesday acquitted a teen-ager who was in a fatal car accident during a driver education course and criticized her instruction, which included the showing of a <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Pryor </PERSON> movie. <ORGANIZATION> Lorain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Juvenile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Webber </PERSON> said <PERSON> Michelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, 18, of <LOCATION> Elyria </LOCATION> was innocent of vehicular homicide. He said she was poorly trained and did not receive proper instruction at the time of the accident. Miss <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> was 17 at the time of the Jan. 23 accident that killed <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Mussey </PERSON>, 75, of <LOCATION> Elyria </LOCATION>. She was taking a class from the Pro Driving School of <LOCATION> Elyria </LOCATION>. She was in tears when the verdict was announced and hugged her parents, <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> and <PERSON> Arlene </PERSON>. `` We've been living with this for nine months,'' <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said. `` I'm so relieved it's hard to have any words to say.'' In his decision, <PERSON> Webber </PERSON> said, `` I find it sad that young people paying good money to learn to drive would get to see a movie such as ` <PERSON> Jo </PERSON> <PERSON> Jo </PERSON> <PERSON> Dancer </PERSON>, -LRB- Your Life is Calling -RRB-' instead of instruction on driving.'' The judge said Ms. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> had n't been prepared to drive in poor road conditions when her driver's education car slid on a snowy road and crossed into the opposite lane, striking the car in which <PERSON> Mussey </PERSON> was riding. Miss <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> had testified during her trial last month that the movie was shown during her first driver education class. The movie was inspired by the comedian's life, particularly events that followed a 1980 incident in which he set himself on fire while smoking cocaine. Classroom instructor <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Myrick </PERSON> testified during the trial that about 15 minutes of the <PERSON> Pryor </PERSON> movie was shown, but Miss <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said she saw about 45 minutes of the film before being pulled out of class to practice maneuverability skills in a parking lot. Witnesses for <ORGANIZATION> Pro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Driving </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> never explained why the movie was shown. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Marie </PERSON>, the teen-ager's attorney, said the movie had no place in a drivers' training class. `` It has no redeeming value whatsoever as far as safe driving is concerned,'' he said. `` It was clearly meant as entertainment.'' Pro Driving School referred a call to attorney <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Elyria </LOCATION>, who said the accident was n't the school's fault. `` You're going to have to learn to drive, and you're going to have to do it on the highway,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. `` So it's not a matter of inadequate training.'' <LOCATION> Lorain </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Prosecutor <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> said he would review the trial transcript and evidence to determine whether the driver's education school or instructor would be criminally liable in <PERSON> Mussey </PERSON>'s death

 Three unarmed <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas who were killed by British soldiers in <LOCATION> Gibraltar </LOCATION> six months ago were shot at least eight times each, a police photographer testified at an inquest Tuesday. The testimony came at the opening of the inquest, which will determine whether the deaths can be legally justified. <PERSON> Coroner </PERSON> <PERSON> Felix </PERSON> <PERSON> Pizzarello </PERSON> began the session by denying a motion to eliminate the 11-member jury from the inquest on the grounds that publicity about the killings had favored the British soldiers who fired on the guerrillas. <PERSON> Mairead </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrell </PERSON>, <PERSON> Sean </PERSON> <PERSON> Savage </PERSON> and <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> McCann </PERSON>, who the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> has admitted were on a mission at the time of their deaths, were shot and killed by seven soldiers near a gas station in the British colony of <LOCATION> Gibraltar </LOCATION> on March 6. Critics of <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s government claim the killings were part of an unofficial `` shoot-to-kill'' policy against members of the <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. British authorities said the three men were planning a car bomb attack at the site where the Royal Anglian Regiment band accompanies a weekly changing of the guard ceremony. The police photographer who testified Tuesday, <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Reyes </PERSON>, said that <PERSON> Farrell </PERSON>, <PERSON> Savage </PERSON> and <PERSON> McMann </PERSON> were each shot at least eight times. He identified black-and-white photographs he took showing the bullet entry and exit wounds. <PERSON> Reyes </PERSON> said <PERSON> Savage </PERSON> was hit with bullets in the head, hand, arms, side and chest; <PERSON> McCann </PERSON> in the head, torso, thigh, stomach and chest; and <PERSON> Farrell </PERSON> in the face, side and chest just below the heart. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> McGrory </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> lawyer representing the families of the dead, argued that the jurors should not participate in the hearings because they would be influenced by British press coverage of the shootings. He said reports favored the members of the <ORGANIZATION> Special </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> unit who did the shooting. The day after the slayings, <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> Foreign Secretary Sir <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> that the three <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> suspects were unarmed. <PERSON> McGrory </PERSON> is expected to question witnesses who say the three men were given no chance to surrender before the soldiers shot them. After the shooting, police found a rented car parked near the area where the ceremony of the guards took place. Authorities said they first believed it had been rigged as a car bomb. A second rented car containing timing devices and wire was found on the Spanish side of the border from <LOCATION> Gibraltar </LOCATION>. Two days after the shootings, <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> police found a third car packed with explosives in a garage in <LOCATION> Marbella </LOCATION> on the Spanish coast. If the inquest's jury decides the British soldiers acted in an unlawful manner, the soldiers may be criminally indicted under British law. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Hucker </PERSON>, who represents the soldiers referred to only as `` soldiers A to G,'' said his clients were prepared to testify at the hearing, but only if reporters and the public are excluded and their voices electronically altered. <PERSON> Pizzarello </PERSON> said the inquest, which is taking place in the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> building, would last about four weeks. The overwhelmingly <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> seeks to oust <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> troops from mainly Protestant <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> and to unite it with the predominantly <LOCATION> Catholic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>.

 West German officials want to take over part of a key <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> air base near <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> to enlarge the city's commercial airport, a newspaper said Tuesday. The report added to growing speculation about the future of the <LOCATION> Rhein-Main </LOCATION> Air Base that adjoins <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> international airport. <PERSON> Hesse </PERSON> state wants 20 percent of the 776-acre <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> base to enlarge passenger facilities at the <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> airport, according to the Bonn-based Die <ORGANIZATION> Welt </ORGANIZATION> newspaper. It quoted Hesse Economics Minister <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON>. The <LOCATION> Rhein-Main </LOCATION> base, which <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces in <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> refer to as the `` Gateway to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>,'' has been the site of historic events. In January 1981 the 52 Americans who had been held hostage in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> arrived at the base and in 1985 Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> greeted the 39 Americans flown there after they were released by the hijackers of a <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> jetliner. <LOCATION> Rhine-Main </LOCATION> was a major base for the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Airlift in 1948, when planes delivered thousands of tons of food, fuel and clothing to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> after Soviet forces blockaded the city. There have been heated discussions in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> in recent months about how to cope with overcrowded skies and airports that are causing flight delays and cancellations. A large number of air corridors over <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and numerous air bases are reserved for <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> forces. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military took over the <LOCATION> Rhein-Main </LOCATION> base after World War II. Hesse Gov. <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallmann </PERSON> on Tuesday denied reports that the state is planning to buy and take over all of the air base. <ORGANIZATION> Hessischer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rundfunk </ORGANIZATION> radio last Friday reported that West German officials had offered about $ 128 million for the entire Rhine-Main site. `` These reports come out of thin air,'' <PERSON> Wallmann </PERSON> told reporters in the state capital of <LOCATION> Wiesbaden </LOCATION>. `` We are speaking with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> armed forces about how to ensure the position of the <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> airport in the face of increasing air travel.'' <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>'s commercial airport and the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> share use of the runways at the site, six miles south of <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> spokesman Lt. Col. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Maloney </PERSON>, contacted by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> by telephone at at his <LOCATION> Rhein-Main </LOCATION> office, said, `` There is nothing being discussed at this level.'' <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Heath </PERSON> would say only that the reports about the base were `` hypothetical.'' The <LOCATION> Rhein-Main </LOCATION> base has been used mainly by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlift </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> to transport military personnel to and from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>

 Rock star <PERSON> Elton </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON> threw a high-class garage sale of his treasures at the world's richest art auction house Tuesday and cleared nearly $ 2 million on the first day. <PERSON> Sotheby </PERSON>'s, the auctioneers, said the opening batch of memorabilia fetched double their estimated worth, and an evening sale of mostly art deco jewelry also fetched more. `` I'm absolutely thrilled,'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> said in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> after hearing the result of the sale, <ORGANIZATION> Sotheby </ORGANIZATION>'s reported. Three more days of sales will see off <PERSON> John </PERSON>'s art collection, antiques and furniture. The gemstuff on Tuesday sold for $ 1.2 million _ $ 200,000 over estimate _ to make a total for the day of $ 1,975,290. After the daytime rock fans, a smart evening crowd _ but lacking celebrities _ crowded in to watch glamorous models showing off rings, bracelets, brooches and pendants worn by <PERSON> John </PERSON>. There were also boxes and miniature clocks by famous makers like <PERSON> Faberge </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Cartier </ORGANIZATION>. Top price of the evening was $ 42,700 paid by <LOCATION> Seibu </LOCATION>, a Japanese department store for a Cartier 1923 emerald, onyx and diamond lapel watch. <PERSON> John </PERSON>, 41, who says he has run out of room for new things at his mansion, was in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, preparing a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> tour. But plenty of fans turned up to bid for his glitzy eyeglasses, zany hats and costumes, diamante-soled platform shoes, pinball machines, <PERSON> Rembrandt </PERSON> etchings and jukeboxes. Prices soared two, three and four times above estimate for items some art critics have dismissed as junk. `` Buyers were coming out of the woodwork _ most of them we had never heard of,'' said <PERSON> Sotheby </PERSON>'s spokeswoman <PERSON> Susy </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>. The top price of the day was $ 29,744 for a Wurlitzer jukebox made in 1940 and originally offered for $ 11,830. A camisole worn by <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Garland </PERSON> in the movie `` Meet Me in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>'' sold for $ 3,346, more than three times the top estimate. Three signed photographs of the American Apollo 15 astronauts dedicated to the `` Rocket Man,'' one of <PERSON> John </PERSON>'s biggest hits, sold for $ 3,350, when only $ 300 had been expected. The outrageous eyeglasses of the pianist-singer-composer were the biggest draw. And the biggest buyer appeared to be <ORGANIZATION> Warwick </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stone </ORGANIZATION>, bidding by telephone from <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, who spent about $ 118,000 on items for his Hard Rock Cafe. The restaurant chain paid the top price of $ 5,948 for a pair of glasses with blue and yellow lenses in mother-of-pearl frames embelished with rhinestones. Stone also bought platform boots, a presentation gold disc and a boater with a model of the Eiffel Tower in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> on top. The 54-inch-high fiberglass boots worn by <PERSON> John </PERSON> as the Pinball Wizard in the rock movie `` Tommy'' went to <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> businessman <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Griggs </PERSON> for $ 20,200. `` We thought they would be the ideal thing for the company to use in exhibitions,'' said <PERSON> Griggs </PERSON>, a boot and shoemaker. An ordinary straw boater of <PERSON> John </PERSON>'s from <LOCATION> Dobbs </LOCATION> of Fifth Avenue, size 7 -LRB- inches, sold for $ 1,400. <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON> <PERSON> Cowdrey </PERSON>, a British fan, said after paying $ 8,900 for the rock star's `` Yellow Brick Road'' cream canvas stage suit, embroidered with album song titles: `` This costume is so <PERSON> Elton </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> I </PERSON> just had to have it. I'll wear it myself if it fits.'' The first of the 290 lots to go was a pencil sketch of comedians Laurel and <PERSON> Hardy </PERSON>, which went for $ 1,100, against an estimate of $ 670. `` I knew then it was going to be a good day,'' said auctioneer <PERSON> Hilary </PERSON> <PERSON> Kay </PERSON>, who was on the rostrum for more than five hours, while the sale raked in $ 711,803. `` It's all such fun. It's attracting interest from people who have never dreamed of going to a sale before,'' said <PERSON> Marcus </PERSON> <PERSON> Linell </PERSON>, the <PERSON> Sotheby </PERSON>'s director who organized the auction. But arts reporter <PERSON> Godfrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Barker </PERSON> of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> sniffed that <PERSON> Sotheby </PERSON>'s `` looks more like a <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> department store than an art auction house ... Art as excellence is quite demode.''

<TEXT>
 Unemployment checks, last-minute college placements and letters to the editor disappeared into mountains of unsorted mail Tuesday as <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s postal strike escalated. With the nationwide strike in its seventh day, 80 million letters and parcels were held up in darkened post offices. Deliveries in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> were at a virtual halt. All 11,000 mailboxes in the capital were sealed. Private couriers rejoiced, but postal customers scrambled to find alternative ways to deliver their messages, money or bills. The government hired a private courier company to deliver unemployment checks. The Times, <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> and Independent invited readers to send letters to the editor by Fax machine. `` Any system which relies on the post must be in difficulties at a time like this,'' said <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Hiscock </PERSON>, head of administration at the <ORGANIZATION> Universities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> on Admissions. The council, an intermediary between universities and their applicants, set up telephone banks to help match students rejected elsewhere with schools that had openings. <PERSON> Hiscock </PERSON> estimated up to one-third of the annual 15,000 last-minute applications were caught in the backlog. The dispute over regional pay differences and the use of temporary workers shut down 60 of the country's 80 main sorting offices by Tuesday, said <PERSON> Sally </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, a post office spokeswoman. The service has 180,000 workers. Ms. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said that 70,000 workers involved in sorting and delivery stayed away, up from 48,000 Monday. About 15 million letters, compared with a daily 51 million, were being delivered, she said. Earlier estimates said 100 million items were backlogged, but Ms. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> put the figure at 80 million. Talks on renewing negotiations continued between the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> and the Union of Communication Workers but no details were disclosed. <ORGANIZATION> TNT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> U.K. </LOCATION>, which claims to be <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s largest courier, said it has experienced a 400 percent increase in business since the strike began Wednesday. Patience wore thin among postal consumers. `` Business has increased, but in some respects it's holding us back,'' said <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON>, sales manager at a <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> store. `` We ca n't complete deliveries until we get confirmation. We also ca n't get invoices out, so we ca n't get paid. `` Many firms are experiencing considerable disruption, frustration and annoyance through this unnecessary strike,'' said <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, director general of the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chambers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>, which represents 65,000 businesses. A statement issued by three large mail order and direct marketing groups demanded that the strike end.

 A burning building collapsed on firefighters battling a suspicious fire Tuesday, killing one and injuring three others, authorities said. The fire in two adjoining buildings broke out at 2:12 p.m., sending dense smoke throughout the downtown area for several hours. One of the buildings was vacant and the other housed a clothing store. It was the second major fire in the area in five days. On Thursday, a fire destroyed three downtown buildings. The roof and second floor of one of the buildings collapsed at 4:30 p.m., trapping three firefighters. Two were removed within 20 minutes, but rescuers with power saws worked more than an hour to reach the third.

<TEXT>
 Defense Minister <PERSON> Willem </PERSON> <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Eekelen </PERSON> announced his resignation Tuesday after allegations that he bungled the introduction of a new passport system. `` I have asked her majesty the queen -LRB- <PERSON> Beatrix </PERSON> -RRB- to allow me to resign,'' <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Eekelen </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. His action marked the first such resignation from Premier <PERSON> Ruud </PERSON> <PERSON> Lubbers </PERSON>' coalition government of centrist <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> and rightist Liberals since it came to power in 1982. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Eekelen </PERSON>'s decision came after a parliamentary inquiry committee said earlier this month that he had mismanaged the passport project during his 1982-1986 tenure as a deputy foreign minister. `` A minister of defense should defend himself to the utmost but also limit casualties,'' he told <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. There was no immediate indication who would succeed the 57-year-old defense minister. The overhaul of the passport system has been beset by controversy since its announcement in 1982. The new document was supposed to be more forgery proof than the current passport and bring this nation into line with passport requirements set by the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>. The parliamentary report said <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Eekelen </PERSON> had granted the documents to develop and produce new passports to a newly formed conglomerate without seriously considering rival bids from other companies. It contained no charges of corruption against <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Eekelen </PERSON> who was appointed defense minister after the 1986 general elections.

 Police who had been held at bay for nine hours Tuesday by a rain of shotgun pellets returned fire and mortally wounded the sniper through his door, then found his two children dead in their high-rise apartment. The siege left 14 officers injured, but all were treated and released, officials at two hospitals said. <PERSON> Cho </PERSON> <PERSON> Mun </PERSON> <PERSON> Chu </PERSON>, 45, who was removed from his city-subsidized Lower East Side apartment on a stretcher, died later at <LOCATION> Bellevue </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, said Sgt. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Clifford </PERSON>, a police spokesman. The bodies of 8-year-old <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> Chu </PERSON> and her 9-year-old brother <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Chu </PERSON>, were found with wounds to the head, covered with blankets and pillows in the hallway of apartment, police said. They were shot with what was believed to be a long-barrel shotgun filled with bird shot, said police spokesman Lt. <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>. The girl's death was believed to be the first time in the 15-year history of the elite police Hostage Negotiating Unit that a hostage was lost during negotiations, said another police spokesman, Sgt. <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Donnell </PERSON>. Police believe the boy was already dead when they arrived, but the girl was seen alive by a police camara, Commissioner <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Chu </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Hui </PERSON> <PERSON> Choy </PERSON> <PERSON> Chu </PERSON>, who also used the name <PERSON> Angela </PERSON>, was believed to be in <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> O'Donnell </PERSON>. <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> said police were forced to shoot <PERSON> Chu </PERSON> in self-defense after removing the door to his 11th-floor apartment from its hinges in an attempt to bring the girl to safety. `` We waited until he fired point-blank _ one captain was hit, four lieutenants were hit, and one police officer was hit by pellets, and he was now firing point blank at the door,'' the commissioner said. The officers returned two shots, hitting <PERSON> Chu </PERSON> twice in the chest, <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> said. First Deputy Police Commissioner <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Condon </PERSON> said earlier that `` a rain of pellets'' descended on officers who arrived about 6 a.m. to investigate a report of shots fired. Scores of police then cordoned off a four-block area around the building. The FDR Drive, a main highway along the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> into <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>, was closed in both directions near the <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION>, creating enormous traffic jams. For about a half-hour as the incident ended shortly after 3 p.m., the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> was closed to marine traffic between the <LOCATION> Williamsburg </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> bridges, said a <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, Petty Officer <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Midgett </PERSON>. Police attempts to communicate with the suspected sniper were unsuccessful until a Cantonese-speaking detective was brought in to act as interpreter. <PERSON> Condon </PERSON> said negotiations were difficult because the interpreter and suspect were shouting through a door, which was locked and barricaded by furniture. Police had said the man had made no threats against his family, and in the course of negotiations had made no demands. `` He seems to have some kind of financial problems and family problems and that seems to be what has set him off,'' <PERSON> Condon </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Victoria </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>, who lives on the 18th floor of the building, said the man recently moved in and quickly gained a reputation for having a bad temper. `` He gets into it with management and the tenants,'' she said. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> police had been called to the 25-story building before because of problems with the man.

 An 11-year-old English boy crawled ashore at <ORGANIZATION> Shakespeare </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beach </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday and set a new record as the youngest person to swim the English Channel, the <ORGANIZATION> Channel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Swimming </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON>, age 11 years and 333 days, broke the record set in 1979 when <PERSON> Marcus </PERSON> <PERSON> Hooper </PERSON> made the crossing at age 12 years, 53 days. Both boys belonged to the <ORGANIZATION> Eltham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Swimming </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Training </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, 78 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Dover </LOCATION>. `` All I want to do is have a 48-hour kip -LRB- sleep -RRB-,'' <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> said as he came ashore at 5 p.m. -LRB- noon EDT -RRB-, 11 hours, 45 minutes after setting out from <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gris-Nez </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> surpassed <PERSON> Hooper </PERSON>'s time of 14 hours, 37 minutes, said association secretary <PERSON> Audrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>. The boy made his crossing two weeks after Brazilian <PERSON> Renata </PERSON> <PERSON> Camara </PERSON> <PERSON> Agondi </PERSON>, 20, died during a bid to conquer the 21 miles of water separating <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. The boy's parents, <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON>, met him as he arrived exhausted on the <LOCATION> Dover </LOCATION> beach. Also on the scene was his sister, <PERSON> Anna </PERSON>, who has swum the channel three times on six-person relay teams for the <LOCATION> Eltham </LOCATION> club. `` We are delighted with his efforts,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON>, who allowed her son to take the day off from school to make the swim. `` It's made all the training worthwhile.'' Also on Tuesday, <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Hogendorp </PERSON>, a native of <LOCATION> Edmonton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alberta </LOCATION>, failed in his attempt to swim the channel, abandoning the attempt about five miles from <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. The 22-year-old, a soldier with the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canadian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Horse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Artillery </ORGANIZATION> based in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, `` just ran out of gas,'' said his coach, <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Ritchie </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 Wind-whipped forest blazes across <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> prompted a ban Tuesday on all outdoor recreation on state and federal lands outside cities and towns, Gov. <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwinden </PERSON> and federal agencies said. The ban imposed by <PERSON> Schwinden </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Land </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> applies to all state and federal land, including all rivers and streams, outside cities, towns and national parks, the governor said. It affects all non-essential activities such as sightseeing, hunting, fishing, boating, rafting, camping, hiking, picnicking and wood-gathering. Farm work, livestock herding, house-building, mining and logging are allowed. However, <PERSON> Schwinden </PERSON> warned that these activities could be banned unless the fire danger wanes. <PERSON> Schwinden </PERSON> said the ban will remain until weather conditions ease the fire danger and that probably will require a substantial amount of rain. The ban came less than a week after the state Fish and Game Commission delayed start of the 1988 hunting season, followed by a plea from <LOCATION> Schwinden </LOCATION> for Montanans to stay out of the forests over the Labor Day weekend. For the most part, <PERSON> Schwinden </PERSON> said, his request worked. Although there were 58 new fires started in the state since his Aug. 31 statement, none developed into a major blaze, he said. The ban on recreation will be enforced by personnel from the <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> BLM </ORGANIZATION>, state wildlife agency and the state Lands Department. <PERSON> Schwinden </PERSON> said violators probably will be warned first before being cited. <PERSON> Brubaker </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> has endorsed the ban and it may be extended to <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>'s seven Indian reservations after the various tribal councils are consulted. Glacier and <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> national parks were excluded from the ban because the <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> has its own restrictions on recreation already in place, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>, attorney for Schwinden. Fishing guides in <LOCATION> Ennis </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Helena </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION> complained that the ban on floating and angling puts them out of business. `` Banning fishing is ridiculous,'' said <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Weimer </PERSON>, owner of <PERSON> Helena </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Montana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Goods </ORGANIZATION>. `` It makes sense to ban fires, smoking and off-road driving, but fishing? All I do is put a raft in the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> from a blacktopped road.''

 Two cosmonauts returned safely to <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> early Wednesday after their descent was aborted twice because of a system malfunction and their food and oxygen began to run out, the official Soviet news agency reported. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported that <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahad </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohmand </PERSON>, the first Afghan in space, and his Soviet crewmate, <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyakhov </PERSON>, touched down at 4:50 a.m. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> time -LRB- 8:50 p.m. EDT Tuesday -RRB- in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. `` Both cosmonauts feel fine after the landing,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. The agency said their Soyuz TM-5 space capsule landed 99 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Dzhezkazgan </LOCATION>, a town on the steppes of the republic of <LOCATION> Kazakhstan </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. The town is about 1,365 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. Soviet news reports earlier had said neither cosmonaut was in immediate danger but that the situation soon could become critical. `` Accident! The engine worked 60 seconds and shut off. A violation of the stabilization regime,'' <PERSON> Lyakhov </PERSON> told mission control in an exchange reported by the government newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Lyakhov </PERSON>, 47, is a military pilot who has flown in space twice before, and <LOCATION> Mohmand </LOCATION>, 29, is an Afghan air force pilot. <PERSON> Lyakhov </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Mohmand </LOCATION> and Soviet doctor <PERSON> Valery </PERSON> <PERSON> Polyakov </PERSON> were launched into space Aug. 29 and boarded the orbiting Mir space station two days later. <PERSON> Polyakov </PERSON> remained aboard, but <PERSON> Lyakhov </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Mohmand </LOCATION> undocked the Soyuz at 2:55 a.m. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> time -LRB- 6:55 p.m. Monday EDT -RRB- for the trip home. <PERSON> Polyakov </PERSON> stayed on the Mir to monitor the health of two other cosmonauts who have been in space for more than eight months. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Oberg </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> expert on the Soviet space program who is familiar with the Soyuz TM-5 design, had said Tuesday that time was running out. `` If they can not make the burn tonight to push them back into the atmosphere, they will probably only live another 24 to 48 hours before the carbon dioxide building in the capsule will kill them,'' <PERSON> Oberg </PERSON> said in an interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. Officials of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> said <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> volunteered help but the Soviets declined, saying `` they had a technical problem, but that no assistance was needed.'' The <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aerospace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> said the Soyuz had split into at least two parts, a normal procedure for re-entry. `` We are tracking two pieces associated with TM-5,'' said Maj. <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondragon </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> NORAD </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. The capsule was in an orbit 226 miles by 206 miles and the ship's living compartment was circling Earth 234 miles at the highest point and 155 miles at the lowest. The Soyuz capsule is designed for trips to and from space, not for long flights. <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> earlier reported that life support systems on the globe-shaped capsule were designed to last two days, meaning that had the cosmonauts not been able to descend, they would have been in jeopardy by Thursday morning. According to the Soviet space official, however, the cosmonauts could have stretched supplies of oxygen, water and food for up to a week. After that the capsule would be like `` a lone boat in the ocean,'' he said, speaking on condition of anonymity. He did not explain how the air supply could be extended. The capsule would have landed in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> had the descent not been aborted. The space official said contingency landing sites in general were not desirable because no proper ground crews would be there. An <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> article under the headline `` Anxious Hours in Space'' reported this exchange between mission control and the cosmonauts: `` How are things with food?'' a mission controller asked. `` There is no food,'' said <PERSON> Lyakhov </PERSON>. `` But in the accident reserves?'' the controller asked. `` There is some, but why touch it? We will endure,'' <PERSON> Lyakhov </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said the cosmonauts `` are in for difficult hours in orbit until the designated time of landing.'' Soviet television showed black-and-white videotape taken from the Soyuz in which the Mir station, whose extended solar panels gave it the shape of a T, grew steadily smaller as the capsule pulled away. Television commentator <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Tikhomirov </PERSON> said later, in a somber voice: `` We are already used to everything going smoothly in space, and some forget about the danger which space research entails. And here this once more convinces us how complex a matter it is and what a huge amount of abnormal situations awaits cosmonauts in orbit.'' Trouble began soon after the Soyuz left its dock on the Mir. An engine used to slow the capsule for entering Earth's atmosphere fired automatically while the vehicle was out of radio contact with ground control, <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> said When contact was restored, <PERSON> Lyakhov </PERSON> gave his report that the engine stopped after 60 seconds, far short of the 230 seconds needed to brake the capsule for a safe re-entry, Soviet media said. Controllers decided to delay another attempt for three hours, <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> reported. During that time, scientists found that sunlight had interfered with a sensor in an infrared guidance system and a computer automatically terminated the engine burn. Seven minutes later, the sensor locked onto its correct target and the guidance system worked properly. The engine fired again, but because the on-board computer had not been reprogrammed the capsule was sent on a trajectory for a landing in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, the reports said. The cosmonauts stopped the engine manually after three seconds and tried again, but that time the engine stopped after six seconds and the decision was made to wait until Wednesday. <PERSON> Valery </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryumin </PERSON>, a cosmonaut and the mission chief, told <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION>: `` Do n't worry, nothing terrible has happened yet. The life support system will last for two days.''

 Assassinated Prime Minister <PERSON> Olof </PERSON> <PERSON> Palme </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> probably tried to sell arms to <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> during a 1986 disarmament conference the month before he died, a former Palme aide said on a television news program Tuesday. Palme, whose February 1986 shooting in <LOCATION> Stockholm </LOCATION> remains unsolved, discussed an arms sale with Prime Minister <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> during an international conference on disarmament in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION> in January 1986, according to the program `` First Tuesday'' broadcast on commercial Independent Television. The program quoted <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>, whom the program identified as an adviser for Palme on disarmament, as saying <ORGANIZATION> Palme </ORGANIZATION> asked <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> to buy 400 long-range howitzers from <ORGANIZATION> Bofors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AB </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>'s largest arms maker. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> rejected advice from Indian military experts to purchase rival French-manufactured cannon and awarded a $ 1.36 billion contract to <ORGANIZATION> Bofors </ORGANIZATION>, which had been experiencing financial troubles, the program said. It was <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>'s largest-ever export contract, the program said. `` I think he -LRB- Palme -RRB- obviously used that opportunity -LRB- the conference -RRB- to discuss the <LOCATION> Bofors-India </LOCATION> deal,'' <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> said. A Swedish government investigation concluded in June that <ORGANIZATION> Bofors </ORGANIZATION> paid unspecified commissions in the deal, but did not say whether those payments violated the agreement. `` First Tuesday'' said <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> supported the deal because of guarantees it would be free of middlemen and commissions, which usually raise the cost. Palme was shot in downtown <LOCATION> Stockholm </LOCATION> on Feb. 28, 1986 while walking home from a movie. Police have failed to establish a motive or prosecute any suspect. The program also alleged that Palme allowed Swedish manufacturers to skirt laws banning arms exports to warring countries, making it possible for <LOCATION> Swedish </LOCATION> arms to reach <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> during its eight-year war with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> had appointed Palme to mediate in the war, but `` First Tuesday'' said Swedish companies supplied <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> with trucks and patrol boats and helped the Iranians build an explosives factory. Last month, the Swedish magazine `` Z'' claimed that <LOCATION> Palme </LOCATION> was assassinated in revenge for stopping the sale by <ORGANIZATION> Bofors </ORGANIZATION> of 18 cannon to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in late 1985.

<HEAD>Opposition Given Access to National Television</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTIAGO, Chile (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Opponents of the military government have been given limited access to national television for the first time in 15 years as both sides formally opened their campaigns for the presidential plebiscite. Under a new electoral law that went into effect late Monday, supporters of President <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> and the opposition will have 15 minutes of free time daily on national television to carry their messages to <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>'s 7.2 million registered voters. Neither side has to pay for the programs that by law can continue until Oct. 1, four days before the plebiscite in which Gen. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>, the army commander, is the only candidate. The opposition, which has complained about its lack of access to government-controlled television, criticized the late hour set by the new law. It states both sides will have 15 minutes alternating between the time period of 10:45 p.m. and 11: .15 p.m. `` For the first time in 15 years those who do not share the government views have the opportunity to adress you on television,'' said <PERSON> Patricio </PERSON> <PERSON> Banados </PERSON>, the opposition's official announcer in opening the Monday night program. `` Fifteen minutes in 15 years is not too much.'' <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> led the coup in September 1973 that ousted the elected government of Marxist President <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON> <PERSON> Allende </PERSON>. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> has ruled the country since then and was selected last month by the military junta he controls as the sole candidate in next month's ballot In the referendum Chileans will vote `` yes'' or `` no'' on <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>. If he is approved he will start an eight-year term as president next March. If rejected, a multiple-candidate election will take place in December 1989 with <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> remaining in power until then. During the opposition's television program Monday its campaign song, `` <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Joy </PERSON> is Coming,'' was played constantly. The program ended with <PERSON> Patricio </PERSON> <PERSON> Aylwin </PERSON>, a centrist who is the main spokesman for a 16-group coalition, urging a `` no'' vote in the plebiscite and challenging <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> to a a face-to-face debate on national television. The government based its program mainly on economics, saying inflation had been reduced to an annual rate of about 10 percent and noting the increase in exports. It also showed television clips and photographs of the street violence, food shortages and other economic problems during <PERSON> Allende </PERSON>'s government. An announcer said those conditions would return if the referendum is defeated. The 15-minute programs will be the only television advertising allowed to the opposition. Paid political advertising is banned by law on the television stations that are operated either by the government or various universities. The government has broadcast a series of referendum-related advertisements but officials claimed they did not violate the law and were a `` legitimate promotion of the government's work and achievements.''

 Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>'s customary message of peace and reconciliation could be a controversial one when he visits <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>, a southern African nation wracked by 12 years of civil war, drought and systematic destruction of public facilities. A newsletter issued last year by <ORGANIZATION> Frelimo </ORGANIZATION>, the governing Marxist party, called the former <LOCATION> Portuguese </LOCATION> colony's <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> bishops `` enemies of the people'' after they suggested the government meet with guerrillas of the Mozambican National Resistance. But Cardinal <PERSON> Alexandre </PERSON> <PERSON> dos </PERSON> <PERSON> Santos </PERSON> says he hopes the pope will call for reconciliation when he visits the country Sept. 16-19. President <PERSON> Joaquim </PERSON> <PERSON> Chissano </PERSON>, who was visiting the pope in the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> when the bishops made their plea, said it was impossible to negotiate with the guerrillas who, he charged, mutilate children, burn schools and hospitals, and massacre villagers. The guerrilla movement, known as <ORGANIZATION> RENAMO </ORGANIZATION>, denies such charges and says it is fighting to replace the Marxist government with a democratic one. `` We hope -LRB- the pope -RRB- will say something about peace since we are in this situation of war,'' said <PERSON> Dos </PERSON> <PERSON> Santos </PERSON>, who became a cardinal in June. `` We do n't see how we can end this struggle without reconciliation. ... It is necessary to have dialogue with these people.'' Foreign Minister <PERSON> Pascoal </PERSON> <PERSON> Mocumbi </PERSON> said the government hopes the pope will not appeal for negotiations with <ORGANIZATION> RENAMO </ORGANIZATION>. He said no one had the right to suggest that the government `` should talk with terrorists, with those who commit massacres, ... those who have been roundly condemned, not only by <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> but by the international community.'' Job Chambal, director of the government's <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Religious </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION>, is overseeing the return of some church property confiscated when <ORGANIZATION> Frelimo </ORGANIZATION> came to power at independence from <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> in 1975. He said of the bishops: `` Our quarrel with them is not the fact that they called for negotiations _ any <LOCATION> Mozambican </LOCATION> is free to think that. The one thing that worried the government was to ... say that the government as well as <ORGANIZATION> RENAMO </ORGANIZATION> are responsible for the war.'' <PERSON> Chambal </PERSON> said the plan to return all confiscated church property used for worship came coincidentally three months before the pope's visit `` We were not trying to please the <PERSON> pope </PERSON>,'' he said. `` It's a way of showing we do n't belong to an evil empire.'' Since 1982, when the late President <PERSON> Samora </PERSON> <PERSON> Machel </PERSON> held meetings with church leaders, the government has sought to ease tension between the churches and <ORGANIZATION> Frelimo </ORGANIZATION>. The government invited the pope to visit <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> in his capacity as head of the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> state, and it is sharing expenses with the local church. `` It's very expensive, but it's very important,'' Chambal said. `` The willingness of the pope to come to <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION> means there's been a very big improvement because people have understood what it means when we say we have a socialist state. `` We are Marxists, but all of us in government have some religious background,'' said <PERSON> Chambal </PERSON>, who was reared a Presbyterian. `` We still have some religious feeling. Even our revolutionary songs have a religious taste. But our children will be more Marxist, and teach their children to be Marxists.'' He said the government wants children to be influenced only by the state until they are 18, when they can choose whether to go to church, but this policy is not enforced. In the years immediately after independence, some churches were closed, services were interrupted and religious activity was officially discouraged. Now churches operate freely. Both cathedral services and prayer meetings in the <PERSON> bush </PERSON> are packed on Sundays. The Frelimo revolutionaries accused Roman Catholic bishops and priests of cooperating with the Portuguese colonial government and opposing independence in return for a favored position as a state church. The cardinal says some Portuguese clergymen supported colonialism, but denies the <ORGANIZATION> Mozambican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> as a whole was against independence. All church-state problems are not resolved, Cardinal <PERSON> dos </PERSON> <PERSON> Santos </PERSON> said, but he maintained the government does not understand the church's goals. `` They suppose we want only to teach those who want to be religious leaders,'' he said. `` We also want to prepare the people for running the country.'' <PERSON> Dos </PERSON> <PERSON> Santos </PERSON> said that of <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>'s 14.5 million people, 2 million are Catholics.

<HEAD>Jetliner Crash Heats up Debate on Hong Kong's Airport</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The fatal crash landing of a <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> jetliner has fired up debate on replacing <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>'s airport, known for its harrowing flight path that skims the rooftops of crowded <LOCATION> Kowloon </LOCATION> peninsula. The British-built Trident jetliner skidded off <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>'s sole runway into the sea in a torrential downpour Aug. 31, killing seven people in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>'s worst air accident in 21 years. The accident came at a time when the British colony is considering construction of a new airport away from congested urban areas. The government is funding three surveys to evaluate various proposals. The colony's governor, Sir <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, said immediately following the crash that it should have no bearing on the future of the existing airport, which is known as Kai Tak. The English-language <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> newspaper agreed, but noted in an editorial that `` there is no doubt that the crash will focus renewed attention on the apparently never-ending saga of <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>'s need for expanded aviation facilities.'' <PERSON> Kai </PERSON> <PERSON> Tak </PERSON> is squeezed between the sea and the impossibly crowded neighborhoods of <LOCATION> Kowloon </LOCATION>, one of the colony's major urban areas. The runway juts into <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>'s famed harbor and is surrounded on three sides by water. Use of the airport has expanded rapidly. Last year, 12.7 million passengers were handled, an increase of 20 percent from the year before and nearly 50 percent from 1982. Movement of aircraft reached 73,370 planes in 1986, an increase of 13.2 percent from the previous year. `` The single runway, required to handle an aircraft every 180 seconds during peak hours, has exhausted its possibilities,'' the Morning Post said. The government says the runway can handle up to 30 planes an hour. <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Sit </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hong </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kong </ORGANIZATION> professor who studies urban problems, expressed concern that the airport's enviable safety record may run into trouble as traffic increases. `` We've been lucky,'' he said. `` So far, the accidents all happened on the harbor side of the airport, not on the landward side.'' Although the Chinese jetliner crashed while approaching the runway from the harbor, flights typically make their final approach over <LOCATION> Kowloon </LOCATION>. `` The approach of the airport obviously requires very careful maneuvering by the pilots concerned and very precise control ... by the airport,'' Sit said. Passengers rarely forget the final moments before touchdown when planes come breathtakingly close to <LOCATION> Kowloon </LOCATION>'s buildings <PERSON> Kai </PERSON> <PERSON> Tak </PERSON> critics note the airport becomes paralyzed whenever the runway is disrupted, cutting the colony's main transportation link to the outside world. The Chinese jetliner crash stopped traffic for about six hours. They also argue that the airport's urban location makes life miserable for many local residents. A recent study estimated 1 million people suffer unacceptable noise from <PERSON> Kai </PERSON> <PERSON> Tak </PERSON>. Government officials have been considering replacement possibilities for years and are actively looking at two sites near outlying <LOCATION> Lantau </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> for a new airport. A final decision has been promised by the end of 1989. The most ambitious proposal is from a group led by <ORGANIZATION> Hopewell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd </ORGANIZATION>. The massive $ 3.08 billion-plan would include an airport, seaport, road and railway complex on reclaimed land off the island's east coast near <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> island. The tiny <LOCATION> Portuguese </LOCATION> territory of <LOCATION> Macao </LOCATION>, 40 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, also has proposed building its own international airport. And <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, which regains sovereignty over <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> in 1997, plans to construct an airport in its <LOCATION> Shenzhen </LOCATION> special economic zone just over the <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> border. Sit said that airport would only `` help to ease our trouble a little bit.'' He believes <PERSON> Kai </PERSON> <PERSON> Tak </PERSON> will reach capacity in three to five years, around the time construction could be starting on a new airport, unless the government bows to pressure to act faster. `` That would mean they only start construction when the airport itself has exceeded capacity,'' Sit said. `` It would be fairly difficult for <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> to operate as an international financial trading and tourist center, unless we have some other arrangement.'

Two out of three children under 5 suffer from malnutrition, further decreasing their chances of avoiding _ or surviving _ diarrhea and the six other most prevalent diseases: diphtheria, whooping cough, tetanus, measles, tuberculosis and polio. `` Nearly 50 percent of the diseases could be controlled easily if you could provide potable water to the people,'' said <PERSON> Shreebatsa </PERSON> <PERSON> Prasad </PERSON> <PERSON> Shrestha </PERSON>, an undersecretary in the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION>, the fabled kingdom in the sky, is a land of beauty and mystery, luring adventurers to conquer the majestic heights of <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Everest </LOCATION>, to search for the Abominable Snowman, to explore the pagoda-like temples where Buddhism met Hinduism and spawned the kind of architecture that belongs in fairy tales. It is a country where tourists are warned not to drink the water, where Western embassies have their own doctors and are poised to fly their citizens to <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> for hospital treatment. The Nepalese have little choice but to drink the water, and only 25 percent of them get it from a tap or well, <PERSON> Shrestha </PERSON> said. The rest fetch water from open streams where livestock wallow and people bathe. The country has one doctor for every 26,000 people, in contrast to one doctor per 5,000 people in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and one per 780 in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Lokmaya </PERSON>'s village of <LOCATION> Balambhu </LOCATION> has better health care than most in this nation of 17 million people. People can walk to the local health post in a few minutes, and the village of 1,000 is less than 6 miles from <LOCATION> Katmandu </LOCATION>, the capital, where there are free doctors. In more remote areas, people must walk for days to reach a health post, which may have up to four staffers: a midwife and as many as three `` health assistants'' with first-aid kits. Even in <LOCATION> Balambhu </LOCATION>, the concept of water-borne diseases such as diarrhea is rudimentary. Down the road from where <PERSON> Lokmaya </PERSON> was doing her laundry, women washed their families' breakfast dishes, their children and themselves in another tiny rivulet of water coursing through the mud. A few yards away, a teen-age boy scrubbed a water buffalo. A smaller boy wearing only a tattered brown shirt squatted nearby, for the ground along the rivulet serves as a latrine. Plans for development in <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION>, where the per capita annual income is $ 160 a year, anticipate that 18 percent of all homes will have toilets by the year 2000, compared to an estimated 3 percent now. Television, which started in <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION> only two years ago, has already reached 13 percent of the people and is expected to reach 60 percent by the year 2000. Foreign health workers said they have found people quick to learn health and hygiene precautions, once they understand why they must change their habits. <PERSON> Joann </PERSON> <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Katmandu </LOCATION> director of <ORGANIZATION> Dooley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intermed </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> City-based foundation, said her staff is training Nepalese nurses to conduct classes for menial workers in hospitals. `` We demonstrate how to sweep. We show them how to clean a latrine. We show them how to dig a pit for trash. We show them how to wash their hands,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Duffy </PERSON>, an infection control practitioner from <LOCATION> Torrance </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>. The Nepalese terrain is harder to conquer. Many areas, even those at lower altitudes, are far from roads that motor vehicles can travel. Under a nationwide vaccination campaign aimed at combating tuberculosis, measles and other diseases, <ORGANIZATION> UNICEF </ORGANIZATION> workers are hiking up to four days to reach remote villages. The serum they carry in specially designed `` cold packs'' must be kept below certain temperatures, and the packs can only maintain that temperature for 48 hours, according to <ORGANIZATION> UNICEF </ORGANIZATION>'s chief representative in <LOCATION> Katmandu </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Lay </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Burmese </LOCATION> doctor. To maintain the correct temperature, relays of runners follow them with blocks of ice to keep the serum cool.

<HEAD>To The Government: Butt Out</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 As an authority on economic and business productivity, <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> <PERSON> Grayson </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> watches in amazement as one legislator after another thinks government has the answers. Having served in three administrations, <PERSON> Grayson </PERSON> knows how limited are government's abilities to intervene in the marketplace and correct its problems, specifically when they involve global competitiveness. In that area, he says, there are important things that government should not do, no matter how insistent and intense the pressure. In keeping with that belief, he and associate <PERSON> Carla </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Dell </PERSON> have issued some cautionary advice. Their views are in the form of a book titled, `` American Business: A Two-Minute Warning,'' although it would take even the most efficient and productive reader a lot longer than that to digest their advice. <PERSON> Grayson </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Productivity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, is well-grounded in his subject, having been President <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>'s price commissioner, and a member of President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>'s Commission on the Agenda for the 80s and President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Productivity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisory </ORGANIZATION> From such vantage points, says <PERSON> Grayson </PERSON>, he has observed growing pressure on government to `` do something'' about <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s competitive posture, which is reflected in the balance of payments deficit and other problems Over the past five years, he says, there have been 112 recommendations for government action by 21 councils, commissions, congressional hearings and study groups on productivity and competitiveness. It is frightening, say <PERSON> Grayson </PERSON> and <PERSON> O'Dell </PERSON>, that the 99th <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> had 108 committees and subcommittees in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and 178 in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, with 3,000 staffers `` feeling they must do something to help American competitiveness.'' Stating that such determination by <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to do something `` keeps us awake at night,'' the authors name five things they feel government must not do to `` help American competitiveness.'' 1. The single worst thing is to increase protection, say <PERSON> Grayson </PERSON> and <PERSON> O'Dell </PERSON>. They say it invites reciprocity, lowers efficiency and shrinks export-related jobs. Granting protection, they say, `` is like putting an industry on a life-support system. It may prolong life for a while, but it ca n't restore health.'' 2. Government should not establish industrial policies. Industrial policies are, in effect, attempts at centrally directing the economy to specific national goals. Call it `` national planning'' and you might get an argument, but you would also have material to defend yourself. Industrial policies have been resurrected under the labels of `` trade policies'' or `` competitiveness policies'' or `` living standards acts.'' <PERSON> Grayson </PERSON> and <PERSON> O'Dell </PERSON> maintain that government personnel are not, by instinct or background, entrepreneurs or managers, and that their allocation decisions would be worse than those of the private sector. Furthermore, they observe, authors and administrators of policies and laws tend to be lawyers or economists with little knowledge of business operations. And, they ask, are n't we aware that government can not plan long range and can not stay atop the rapid, continuous adjustments of a dynamic market? 3. The country should avoid currency devaluation as a competitiveness strategy. Among other things, they argue, devaluing the dollar makes the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> compete on the basis of a lower standard of living. `` Devaluation keeps knocking the dollar down until American wages are cheap enough to compete.'' 4. Capital investment should n't be overemphasized. `` We stress that capital investment is not only important for productivity improvement, it is essential,'' they say. `` What we argue against is the overemphasis and wrong emphasis on capital investment.'' One of their reasons for so thinking is that `` merely calling for more capital investment confuses the volume of capital investment with the productivity of that investment.'' 5. More research and development is not necessarily better. `` The biggest competitive problem is not the amount spent on R & amp; D, but on what is spent, and what is done with the ideas and techniques after discovery.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, they point out, is still the world leader in originating new ideas. But, `` while that is great for the good of the world, what counts in competitiveness is rapid commercialization of new knowledge.''

<HEAD>Willem Dafoe Talks About ``That Movie''</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By HILLEL ITALIE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Willem </PERSON> <PERSON> Dafoe </PERSON> is a modest man, but he could n't help thinking the time was right to play the title role in `` The Last Temptation of Christ. `` It made all the sense in the world,'' he said. `` I thought, ` Yes, of course. Perfect. It's a good role. I feel right for it right now.' I'm just at the point in my life where I'm concerned with some of the things he's speaking about. The struggle between the body and the spirit is something I'm interested in.'' Few films have generated as much controversy as <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Scorsese </PERSON>'s `` The Last Temptation of Christ.'' Based on the novel by <PERSON> Nikos </PERSON> <PERSON> Kazantzakis </PERSON>, it depicts an angst-ridden <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON>, torn between desires of the mind and body. In a dream sequence, he is spared the cross, sleeps with <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Magdalene </PERSON> and has children. The movie has drawn fierce protests from some religious groups. `` I was a little surprised,'' <PERSON> Dafoe </PERSON> said. `` I knew there was some resistance. ... I never thought it would be to this extent and take this kind of shape.'' However, the publicity generated from the protests has helped the movie at the box office. `` It's always a terrific thing for a publicity campaign,'' <PERSON> Dafoe </PERSON> said. `` But it colors everything in a negative light. Maybe that's a trade-off to the publicity. <PERSON> Dafoe </PERSON> was eager to work with <PERSON> Scorsese </PERSON>, the director of `` Mean Streets,'' `` Taxi Driver'' and `` Raging Bull.'' `` He just gave me a certain kind of confidence and authority. He kept me on the track. He makes you feel comfortable; he gives you that room. You feel totally unencumbered, free, yet you feel a guiding hand.'' <PERSON> Dafoe </PERSON> also enjoyed working with the cast, which included <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Hershey </PERSON> as <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Magdalene </PERSON> and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowie </PERSON> as <PERSON> Pontius </PERSON> <PERSON> Pilate </PERSON>. `` There was a real sense of purpose,'' he said. `` Marty commands a lot of respect. There was very little money, and the actors were doing it for scale. Everyone wanted to be there. A real ensemble feel.'' Although <PERSON> Dafoe </PERSON> had seen other biblical movies, he had no interest in repeating others' performances. `` I really did n't concern myself with what kind of <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> I was going to be _ the responsibility of playing that role, all the associations, all the information. I thought I would find a place to scrub myself clean of all that and really start out from a wonderfully innocent place.'' <PERSON> Dafoe </PERSON>'s confidence was helped by his faith in Scorsese: `` I would not be cowed by the role. It was a very risky thing. If you're going to be in a situation like that, you might as well be with <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Scorsese </PERSON>.'' The intensity of his performance in `` Last Temptation'' can be measured by his eyes, which rarely blink on camera. `` No matter what you do, it has mythic proportions,'' he said. `` When you're speaking, no matter the context, there is some kind of concentration that's not of this world. `` The general tendency is to look as deeply as you can into the back of someone's brain and deeply understand with every cell in your body what you're saying.'' The 33-year-old actor talked about his career at the Performing Garage, home of the <ORGANIZATION> Wooster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, an experimental theater company. <PERSON> Dafoe </PERSON> is a member and does business there. He was born July 22, 1955, in <LOCATION> Appleton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, and was early attracted to the stage. `` Simply moronic reasons,'' he said, smiling. `` It's fun, it's enjoyable. I like pretending.'' As he grew older, his feelings for acting deepened. `` In the end, it's for its own sake _ for beauty's sake. A lot of professions, you're tracked. You do this, you get that. In acting, you become the canvas. It totally goes back to you,'' he said. `` You're constantly questioning why you do what you do. You're constantly evolving It's a healthy way to live, but very difficult.'' He became a full-time actor at 18, and in 1977, he saw the Wooster Group give a performance of `` Rumstick Road.'' `` It was just unlike anything I'd ever seen,'' he said. `` The event was so extraordinary. It touched my heart. There's no accounting for it. I could n't identify it. It had that kind of maniac energy and this really fluid transformation.'' <PERSON> Dafoe </PERSON> joined the <ORGANIZATION> Wooster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> but also pursued a career in film. After appearing in a few minor films in 1983, he began to attract attention with `` Streets of Fire'' in 1984 and `` To Live and Die in <LOCATION> L.A. </LOCATION>'' in 1985. His big breakthrough came the following year with `` Platoon,'' <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> Stone </PERSON>'s Academy Award-winning film about the Vietnam War. <PERSON> Dafoe </PERSON>'s portrayal of the sympathetic Sergeant <PERSON> Elias </PERSON> earned him an Oscar nomination for supporting actor. Despite film work, he has continued his involvement with the <ORGANIZATION> Wooster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>. `` The whole desire to play around with forms is a liberating thing for an actor,'' he said.

 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has shed the <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> glasses, dropped his twangy voice a note or two and now eschews button-down shirts _ anything to get rid of the preppy image that dogs his run for president against <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> `` There's a tendency to have you fit into a mold,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> vice president complained recently. `` The mold for me is a kind of <ORGANIZATION> Ivy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> elitist, and I resist it.''

Grandpa <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, who presided over those blissful summers in the rambling ocean-front house at <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> now owns, was `` a staunch Democrat'' until <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON> came along. `` <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON> made him see red,'' a friend recalls. <PERSON> Ingels </PERSON> remembers `` staying over'' at the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> home on Halloween and hiding out in the graveyard after `` squirting people with a water pistol loaded with green ink and belting them with a sock full of flour.'' `` Poppy _ I never knew him as anything else _ was a real nice guy, decent and honest, never a braggart. Maybe that's the trouble with the world today. Suddenly a nice guy is a wimp. He was never a wimp in my book. He's not the type to shake his fist at people, but he's got plenty of strong fibers.'' One day fifth-grade teacher <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> got them thinking about the future: `` Some of you will go into business and be leaders. Others may go into politics. Who knows, one of you might be president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' He had no one in mind then, but at 89 he remembers <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as `` a good athlete. He and his brothers always had a real code of ethics.'' Breakfast in the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> household began with mother or father reading a passage from the Bible. Both parents stressed values, especially fairness, modesty and service to others, and were pleased with <PERSON> George </PERSON>'s report card evaluation: `` Claims no more than his fair share of attention.''

 <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON> <PERSON> Flower </PERSON> <PERSON> Sedgewick </PERSON>, who married <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Sedgewick </PERSON>, <PERSON> George </PERSON>'s classmate at Country Day, recalls the strong patriarchal presence of <PERSON> Prescott </PERSON> Sr. when the dating game began for the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> boys: `` ` Now do n't you think it's time to take this young lady home? he would say, and immediately the family chauffeur, <PERSON> Alex </PERSON>, would be called into action.'' The word `` preppy'' had not been invented when 13-year-old <PERSON> George </PERSON> went off to <ORGANIZATION> Phillips </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> here in <LOCATION> Andover </LOCATION> and became a `` prep,'' the campus word for newcomer. He wore a little blue rowing cap topped with a white button, carried the luggage of the lordly seniors to their dorms on the upper hill, burst immediately into any song they commanded, could not venture near the flag staff where upperclassmen were allowed to smoke, and was not to be seen on Main Street until the football team beat <LOCATION> Exeter </LOCATION>, `` the hated redmen from the north.'' `` In those days <LOCATION> Andover </LOCATION> consciously imitated the English public schools like <ORGANIZATION> Eton </ORGANIZATION> and Rugby, so a little hazing was in order,'' said retired English master <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> <PERSON> Leavitt </PERSON>. He remembers <PERSON> George </PERSON> as an `` indifferent scholar. In my class he was a nonentity, just sat there and did n't contribute much. A nice guy but that's about all. He looked like the cover on the Preppy Handbook that came out awhile ago. I did n't have much contact with him outside class, but I must say wimp is the last word I would apply to him.'' Chemistry tutor and basketball coach <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> DiClementi </PERSON>, who knew <PERSON> George </PERSON> better back then, has different memories. `` From the first day I saw him, I knew he was something special. He came from a family with the right priorities. Some kids are n't ready to come here. He was. I never saw him down. Always hustling, but a good loser although you could n't be jolly about the damn thing.'' Wearing the bow tie that is his trademark, `` <PERSON> Deak </PERSON>,'' as decades of old grads call him, sat on the porch of the Andover Inn summoning up the past from the background shouts of the playing fields. `` Poppy was captain of baseball and soccer, played every minute of every game, but I had to talk him into going out for basketball. He was afraid of denying another kid a place on the team. He was a good hacker, as we called regular fellows, always thinking of others. `` There was a Jewish kid nicknamed ` Ovie' _ dead now _ who left school when he did n't get tapped for any of the Greek societies. They talked him into coming back, and <PERSON> Poppy </PERSON> was the first to befriend him, got him to come out for baseball. One day a fly ball bounced off <PERSON> Ovie </PERSON>'s head into the left-fielder's glove and <PERSON> Poppy </PERSON> congratulated him on an assist.'' <PERSON> George </PERSON> and his schoolmates trod the leafy walks in fear of the righteous wrath of `` The Bald One,'' headmaster <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuess </PERSON>, who could ring down the thunder for violating 9 p.m. lights-out curfew or after a bun fight in `` the beanery,'' as the dining rooms in the student Commons were called. The boys often had a tough time keeping a straight face when campus cutup <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Uhler </PERSON> <PERSON> Lemmon </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> deftly mimicked the head's portentous waddle <PERSON> Jack </PERSON>, a year behind <PERSON> George </PERSON>, later made a career of his comic skills on Broadway and in <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>. Coming of age in <LOCATION> Andover </LOCATION>, `` the inmates'' boasted of making the most of the weekly tea dance to gratify the `` old <ORGANIZATION> B.U. </ORGANIZATION>,'' defined in the 1942 <PERSON> Pot </PERSON> <PERSON> Pourri </PERSON>, <PERSON> George </PERSON>'s yearbook, as `` the biological urge.'' `` The music is usually fair, but the girls are not,'' the class social historian observed. `` By 8 p.m. the couples are to be found mostly in the bird sanctuary or in the girls' cars, while faculty wives attempt to police the affair.'' As the decade of the'40s began, the outside world intruded on the lovely wooded and landscaped campus where <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> Wendell </PERSON> <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> first dabbled in verse and where <PERSON> Harriet </PERSON> <PERSON> Beecher </PERSON> <PERSON> Stowe </PERSON>, whose husband taught here, lies buried in the little graveyard. `` Upper-middles,'' third-year boys like <PERSON> George </PERSON>, huddled under blankets to listen to the war news from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> on `` contraband'' radios. Besides morning chapel and nightly bed check, student activities included air raid drills and drawing the blackout curtains. Younger masters were leaving to join the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canadian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>, and one day at assembly a refugee named <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON> <PERSON> Langerhans </PERSON> told in a thick accent about life in a Nazi concentration camp. By senior year, crew cuts were in fashion, and Petty girls adorned the dorms of this academy founded in 1789 for `` the virtuous pious education of youth.''

 On a recent visit to his alma mater, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> remembered Pearl Harbor Day, 1941, `` slouching across campus with my roommate. We kept it on our minds that the Germans were invading <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. We knew exactly what we had to do. We had to beat <LOCATION> Exeter </LOCATION> at football.'' Which they did, 14-13, with the whole school singing and shouting through the snowy night on that special train back from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>. War was almost a curriculum elective by then. The boys sold war bonds, donated their downtown treats money to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S.O. </ORGANIZATION>, gathered up magazines in the dorms every Thursday for the soldiers at nearby <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Devens </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Pot </PERSON> <PERSON> Pourri </PERSON> lost its slick cover to the wartime paper shortage. The class historian noted that `` the whole school thrilled to an address at morning chapel by Col. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stimson </PERSON>, the Secretary of War'' and an <LOCATION> Andover </LOCATION> trustee. <PERSON> George </PERSON>, as chairman of the student deacons, got to escort the secretary to the podium, in addition to his regular duties of checking attendance and taking up the collection. Caught up in the patriotic fervor, <PERSON> George </PERSON> on his 18th birthday, just a few days after graduation, took the train to <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> to enlist in the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>. In the yearbook poll of 193 graduates, he ranked third behind varsity quarterback <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON> <PERSON> Vose </PERSON> as `` most popular,'' `` handsomest'' `` most respected'' and `` best all-around fellow.'' He rated second in `` most faculty drag'' and was out of the running as `` most intelligent,'' `` most likely to succeed'' and `` ladies' man.'' His name was read out in chapel on a September morning in 1944 when his carrier-based torpedo bomber was reported shot down in flames in a raid on the Japanese airstrips on <LOCATION> Chichi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jima </LOCATION> and again when word came that he had been plucked from a rubber raft in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> by a surfacing submarine, the USS Finback. For <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the preppy years were essentially over. When he entered <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> in November l945, he was hardly your <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Arno </PERSON> cartoon caricature of a Yalie, although typical of that first postwar term when three out of five were veterans and gray flannels were beginning to replace officer pink on the old campus. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was already married and soon to start a family. He and <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> first lived in a Quonset hut near the <PERSON> Payne </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitney </PERSON> gym, then in a series of apartments, the last one, as he ad-libbed after a recent campus speech, so close to President <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Seymour </PERSON>'s house `` you could look in the window and see his wife taking a bath. Poppy, as he was still called, sailed though an accelerated economics program in 2 -LCB- years, won the <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> <PERSON> Prize </PERSON> as the outstanding junior and went on to earn Phi Beta Kappa. He also found time to burp baby <PERSON> George </PERSON>, play three years of varsity baseball, letter in soccer and take part in an occcasional fraternity beer bust at the <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kappa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Epsilon </ORGANIZATION> house. His name did n't make the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Haven </LOCATION> police blotter for that riot after the pep rally on the eve of the <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION> football game. His l948 classbook supplied some vivid details: `` Just how many heads collided with billy sticks can not accurately be counted nor how many rolls of toilet paper flew out of dormitory windows, but there is someone who claims he personally stopped 31 trolley cars.'' Like his father before him, and such diverse luminaries as <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Taft </PERSON>, <PERSON> Averell </PERSON> <PERSON> Harriman </PERSON>, <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Luce </PERSON>, <PERSON> Archibald </PERSON> <PERSON> MacLeish </PERSON>, <PERSON> Potter </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Buckley </PERSON> and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sloane </PERSON> <PERSON> Coffin </PERSON>, <PERSON> George </PERSON> was one of l5 juniors tapped for Skull and Bones, the oldest and most secret of the societies anchoring <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION>'s old boy network. He went through the rumored -LRB- Bonesmen never tell -RRB- initiation of climbing into a coffin to confess his sins -LRB- preferably erotic -RRB- in `` The Tomb,'' the windowless, brown sandstone club house. Although <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> went 3 for 5, the big disappointment in his senior year was the baseball team's loss to the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> in the national collegiate finals. As one who knew him well in the preppy days, has kept in touch since the college years and `` will be rooting for him in the <ORGANIZATION> Electoral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>,'' old coach <PERSON> Deke </PERSON> <PERSON> DiClementi </PERSON> has a word of caution for reporters on the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> beat: `` Do n't say he's a nice guy. He really IS a nice guy. That's what's killing him.

 About 25 million Americans have left the land since 1930.

 <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Greep </PERSON>'s wheat got cut, bundled, shocked, racked, hauled and threshed this year, even though <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> was not there to help. Nothing unusual about that in this northeastern <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> community of 109 friendly souls. Or, for that matter, in any other farming community in the land. It is an axiom of rural living: If a neighbor needs help, you help. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Greep </PERSON>, a man with a mission, died just after planting time. His death may explain why his neighbors seemed to go at this year's harvest of his wheat with a special fervor For the last 13 years of <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Greep </PERSON>'s life _ that would be from about the time the agricultural experts began predicting seriously the inevitable extinction of the American family farm _ <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> had set aside, each year, two acres of wheat for the sole purpose of celebrating the values that the family farm represents. The two acres survived the drought. Whether the values will survive is a question. `` <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> had the feeling,'' said his widow, <PERSON> Jo </PERSON> <PERSON> Greep </PERSON>, sitting under a shade tree taking in the ageless scene of a wheat harvest in progress, `` that all of what this means to all of us, and, really, to the country, would be lost if family farms vanished. `` He started doing it I guess just for sentimental reasons. What you're looking at is an old-fashioned threshing bee.'' Indeed, and the labor involved just for old time's sake demonstrated why the agricultural experts are likely right. All that cutting, bundling, shocking, racking, hauling and threshing by all those sweating men and straining animals on <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Greep </PERSON>'s two acres now is done in one operation by one man in one air-conditioned combine moving through miles of ripe wheat as effortlessly as a paddle-wheel steamboat on a still lake, but nowhere near as romantic. What may be lost, with the chaff of efficiency, are those bedrock <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> values that <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rockwell </PERSON> celebrated and <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Greep </PERSON> cherished and his willing neighbors still cling to. Well, the family farm has been self-destructing since long before combines came on the scene, and not always because of world economics and drought, the epitaphs of the'80s. Good old American know-how was an earlier culprit. About 25 million Americans have left the land since 1930. At that time, farm families represented one-fourth of the nation's population After World War II, as industry turned out larger tractors and combines and more effective chemical fertilizers and pesticides, small-scale farmers simply could n't match the cost-per-bushel efficiency of the big operators. Now, of the nation's 2.2 million farmers, fewer than 380,000 are family farmers, those whose only livelihood is farming. They must compete against 130,000 big operators who produce 75 percent of the nation's food. The federal Office of Technology Assessment figures that by the year 2000 as few as 50,000 large-scale farmers could get the job done. `` Obviously,'' says <PERSON> Jo </PERSON> <PERSON> Greep </PERSON>, `` it is n't for food production that <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> needs family farms. `` It's for the spirit of neighborliness and fellowship you're seeing right out there in that field I do n't say those qualities exist only in rural <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, not at all. But I do think that if there is such a thing as a national character, rural <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> has had a lot to do with shaping it symbolically. `` If family farms were to vanish, yes, I feel it would be a national loss.'' For one thing, there would be no further reason for towns like <LOCATION> Longford </LOCATION> to exist. <LOCATION> Longford </LOCATION> has one street, a post office, a store, a grain elevator and an establishment called Slim's Place where the hand-lettered sign out front advertises `` Hamburgers & amp; Ammunition'' and the hand-lettered sign inside says `` This is not Burger King _ you get it my way or you do n't get it at all.'' `` If those fellows doing the threshing want something a little stronger than iced tea,'' said <PERSON> Slim </PERSON> <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON>, the proprietor, `` this is where they will find it.'' There is no question the men in the field were working up a thirst. They took their turns pitching wheat bundles onto a flat wagon _ a rack, they called it _ drawn by a team of Belgian draft horses, wide in the beam and docile. They climbed atop the rack, proving they still could, and pitched the wheat onto the throbbing conveyor belt of the thresher, old guys showing off for their wives, who were frying chickens and mixing potato salad. Drought or not, farmers never seem underfed. A thresher, this one of 1925 vintage, is a marvelous contraption of a dozen belts and gears and wheels and levers. A tractor, as determined to keep going at age 52 as the men on the rack, provides power for the thresher. Together they appear to get the job done, to separate the wheat from the chaff. And the men from the boys. `` Some of the youngsters wonder how we know how to work this thing,'' <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> <PERSON> Heigele </PERSON> shouted above the clatter of the belts and the wheels. <PERSON> Heigele </PERSON> explained how <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Greep </PERSON> had acquired the thresher when a 90-year-old neighbor died some years back. An old tractor turned up in another barn, harness in another, wagons here and there, and a tradition was born of tradition. `` I do n't think anybody would want to go back to this kind of threshing,'' <PERSON> Heigele </PERSON> said, `` but I think it's important to show this generation how we used to do it. We helped one another, farm by farm, because there were only a handful of threshers in the whole county and that was the only way to get it done. `` It got people together. It reminded us how much we depend on one another. That's a good lesson for everybody, not just farmers. `` I guess that's why I've been out here every year for the past 13. It's not only fun, it's important.''

 They are the `` blue canoes,'' the ships of the <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> Highway System that serve as lifelines to waterbound towns in the state's island regions. But the ferries are also becoming more popular with tourists, an inexpensive alternative to the cruise ships on the same scenic runs, and therein lies the rub.

 The tugboat man is in the aft bar, telling tales of giant waves and rolling barges. Families are homesteading the port side passenger lounge, staking out seats with backpacks and grocery sacks, sleeping on blankets spread in the aisle. Up on deck, a tourist aims her videocam at sea otters splashing in the kelp, as the ferry thrums past them at a steady 14 knots toward the rock-lined passage of <PERSON> Sergius </PERSON> <PERSON> Narrows </PERSON>. It's another night on the MV <PERSON> LeConte </PERSON>, one of the nine `` blue canoes'' of the <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> Highway System. For 25 years the blue-and-white ships have served as taxis and tour boats to the waterbound towns of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s island regions. But the system is struggling with increasing demand at all points. Car decks are filling more quickly as passengers come aboard in larger cars, campers, trucks and buses, and the increase in walk-on passengers is even greater. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Davidson </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> since 1986, hopes to persuade the federal government to pay for several high-speed ferries, at a cost of $ 5 million to $ 15 million each. A long-term plan for the ferry system is being drafted as part of that campaign. The ferries sail around the clock along a 3,500-mile route, from <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> up <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s Inside Passage and out a separate run across Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON> and along the <LOCATION> Aleutian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> chain. They carry more than 370,000 people a year and 96,000 vehicles, from tractor-trailer rigs to grocery vans and motorcycles, kayaks and bicycles. They keep many towns in milk, meat, fresh lettuce and fruit. They carry villagers to their doctors in larger towns; high school athletes to their rivals' gyms; winter-bound residents on weekend joy rides. Babies have been born on board; people have died. `` You never really know what will happen,'' says <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Unkel </PERSON>, the <PERSON> LeConte </PERSON> purser. `` It's basically the same things you have anywhere else _ it's just concentrated on a ferry.'' The 235-foot <PERSON> LeConte </PERSON> is one of five `` village boats'' that serve as lifelines to the smaller logging and fishing towns and carry mostly local residents. Four larger sister ships, the `` mainliners,'' make the longest runs to and from <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> <PERSON> Rupert </PERSON>, <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>. Together they're one of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s biggest tourist attractions, a money-saving alternative to the cruise ships that share their scenic routes. The longest trip, a 63-hour voyage from <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Haines </LOCATION>, costs $ 200 for an adult. A 1 -LCB- - hour run from Homer to <LOCATION> Seldovia </LOCATION>, the shortest, costs $ 12 On the 408-foot <LOCATION> Matanuska </LOCATION>, 112 staterooms and hundreds of tourists create the atmosphere of a floating hotel. Outfitted with binoculars, passengers line the windows to scan for humpback and killer whales. But their holiday enthusiasm does n't disguise the no-nonsense nature of this public transportation. Ferry life is one part whale-watching cruise and one part city bus. Passengers seeking the gourmet buffets of cruise ships find instead cafeterias reminiscent of school lunch lines. Sailors double as parking attendants when the ferries are in port. And amid the stern safety warnings on the car deck, a sign instructs passengers they should n't wear their sheath knives on board. `` Some of our back-to-the-future gentlemen come aboard with big <PERSON> Bowie </PERSON> knives,'' says <PERSON> Matanuska </PERSON> <PERSON> Purser </PERSON> <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Bredehoft </PERSON>. `` We do have a dress code.'' The ferries stop at 31 communities, visiting most of them at least every few days. They run according to the tides and politics. What town gets which ferry and when is a perennial battle at Marine Highway headquarters and within the <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION>. Lawmakers control the ferry budget, and thus can sway its management. As the system celebrates 25 years of service, the state also faces long-range questions about the future of its aging fleet. Some want to replace the slow-but-steady diesel ships with speedier catamarans. Others say the fleet should be trimmed, that the state ca n't keep a $ 64 million-a-year ferry system afloat. Boosters argue that the state's subsidy _ about half the total cost _ is small change compared to tourist business generated by the ferries. And yet others say tourism is overshadowing the ferries' first purpose: providing a highway where roads ca n't be built. <PERSON> Davidson </PERSON> says basic transportation is the system's most important service. It is understandable people would peg tourism development on the ferry schedule, but they stand the risk of losing a crucial ferry if there's more demand elsewhere for local residents' use, he says. <LOCATION> Skagway </LOCATION> learned that lesson last year. The tourist town has been trying to build its winter business, but was foiled when a weekend ferry from <LOCATION> Juneau </LOCATION> was canceled so residents on Prince of <LOCATION> Wales </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> could get to <LOCATION> Ketchikan </LOCATION> more often. Some ferry workers question the life span of the current fleet. Three ships _ the <LOCATION> Malaspina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Matanuska </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Taku </PERSON> _ have been in service since the Marine Highway's first year of operation, 1963. The Chilkat is even older. The territorial government bought it in 1957 to replace the area's first ferry, a war surplus <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> landing craft that was privately run beginning in 1949. The youngest ferry is the <LOCATION> Aurora </LOCATION>, built in 1977. Ferry officials also are considering changing the system's southern terminus <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> ferries now dock in downtown <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, but <LOCATION> Bellingham </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tacoma </LOCATION> are vying for a new contract to be signed next year. One of the big complaints of the system's 850 employees is the lack of doctors on board. Pursers trained as emergency trauma technicians have to handle whatever injuries occur until the ferries can get to port. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Unkel </PERSON>, the <PERSON> LeConte </PERSON> <PERSON> purser </PERSON>, says his biggest hassle is calming tourists when a ferry is delayed by loading problems or weather. `` The tourists think they're on a tour boat. They do n't understand our main job is to get from point ` A' to point ` B','' Unkel says No. 2 on his headache list are the ferry runs crowded with children. The ferries sell 10,000 tickets a year to <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> students bound for Little League games, swim meets, music competitions and other activities in their neighboring towns. Most passengers say it is the pleasure of a ferry ride that makes them take the Marine Highway instead of an airplane. `` We've seen glaciers and we've seen bald eagles and we've seen whales and a lot of things we've never seen before,'' says <PERSON> Lynette </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, a Texan traveling on the <PERSON> LeConte </PERSON> with her mother. `` It's so easy.''

An international debate is also raging over <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s practice of loaning the animals to American zoos.

 Scientists and conservationists who rallied to save the rare giant panda when its favorite food ran out are sharply divided over what to do next. The World Wildlife Fund, a conservation group and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s main foreign partner in panda research, recently turned to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> courts to determine if Chinese panda loans to American zoos are exploitative, as it says, or educational, as <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> says. Some Chinese and Western experts say <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> should do more to breed captive pandas, while others say the only solution is to move humans from panda reserves. Even the size of the panda population is under debate. The World Wildlife Fund is preparing to release survey results that put the number of pandas in the wild at 1,100 to 1,500, startlingly higher than previous estimates. A 1977 Chinese survey put the figure at 1,000, and the population is known to have dropped since then due to poaching and a shortage of the panda's favorite food, bamboo. <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tennessee </ORGANIZATION> zoologist who led the survey, says the earlier count was sloppy and too conservative. But <PERSON> Zhou </PERSON> <PERSON> Shoude </PERSON>, the deputy director of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s largest panda reserve, the 800-square-mile <ORGANIZATION> Wolong </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nature </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> near <LOCATION> Chengdu </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Southwestern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, discounted <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s figures, which were based largely on a count of panda nesting areas and droppings. The experts agree, however, that the panda is steadily decreasing in number and that five years after an international alert went out to save it, the outlook is grim. `` There are more pandas than we expected,'' <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> says, `` but they are more critically endangered than we expected.'' Pandas, black-and-white bear-like animals that some say are related to the bear and some say to the raccoon, are native only to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. Experts believe their ancestors lived 20 million years ago, contemporaries of the mastodon and other extinct species. A few hundred years ago, pandas still roamed the lowlands. But humans gradually pushed them into the mountains of western <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Sichuan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Gansu </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Shaanxi </LOCATION> provinces, the only places they now live in the wild World attention was drawn to their plight in 1983 when their dietary staple, arrow bamboo, flowered and died as it does every 40 or more years. The World Wildlife Fund collected more than $ 4.1 million toward saving the animal, and the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> government and citizens contributed millions more. More than 62 animals starved before the bamboo began growing again a few years later. That crisis over, experts are looking more critically at <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s conservation program They acknowledge <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s limited resources, praise its good intentions and press for more action _ without agreeing on the best course. `` Except for the pandas, there's not a lot that's black and white about it,'' <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Cook </PERSON>, a spokesman for the World Wildlife Fund, said in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> is dealing sternly with one obvious problem _ poaching. Its highest court last year ordered panda killers be given long prison terms or even the death sentence. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has been less decisive, however, in dealing with another human problem _ ordinary peasants. Their encroachment on the rare animal's turf, including inside <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s 12 panda reserves, advances steadily. More than 4,000 peasants live in <LOCATION> Wolong </LOCATION>, which became a showcase for panda conservation in 1980 when the World Wildlife Fund helped build a breeding center there. The peasants' terraced corn and potato crops climb high up the slopes of mountains roamed by pandas. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> believes the peasants must be moved _ if not from <LOCATION> Wolong </LOCATION>, then from other reserves. `` They've already destroyed <LOCATION> Wolong </LOCATION>, essentially,'' he says. Human settlements have marooned the pandas in small groups on mountain tops, preventing them from mingling in the mating season and creating the danger of localized inbreeding, he says. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s solution is to move humans from critical areas and plant corridors of trees and bamboo between panda habitats so they can roam freely and mate naturally _ something he said pandas have no trouble doing in the wild.

 Chinese officials, while agreeing in theory, show no signs of acting. <LOCATION> Wolong </LOCATION>'s deputy director, <PERSON> Zhou </PERSON>, says he tries to `` educate'' the peasants in the hope they will leave voluntarily, but he has no fallback plan if they do n't. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> dismissed breeding centers, artificial reproduction and Chinese efforts to develop test-tube pandas, saying, `` We do n't have that much time. However, other scientists believe wild pandas can not be saved in adequate numbers, and that breeding centers are needed to re-populate the forests. Here, too, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s program falls short. `` You need one person who knows exactly where all the pandas are and their histories,'' says <PERSON> Devra </PERSON> <PERSON> Kleiman </PERSON>, assistant director of research at <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zoo </ORGANIZATION>. Captive pandas, kept mainly in pairs in zoos, should instead be kept in large breeding centers where they would have greater chances of finding compatible mates, she says. At a minimum, she adds, zoos should cooperate in breeding their pandas. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Conway </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zoological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> and designer of the <LOCATION> Wolong </LOCATION> breeding center, agreed on the need for two or three national breeding centers where pandas could be carefully managed in an accelerated propagation program. But Chinese zoos cooperate little. The Forestry Ministry, in charge of conservation, said it does not even keep count of how many pandas are in captivity in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. Official media reports say there are more than 80. <LOCATION> Wolong </LOCATION>, with eight captive pandas, puts males and females together only for the brief spring mating season, as do many zoos. Then, relative strangers and unable to act out their elaborate mating rituals of the wild, the pandas are notoriously uninterested in romance. According to Chinese count, captive pandas worldwide have produced fewer than three dozen surviving cubs. `` I do n't think anyone is pleased with the progress that has been made in captive breeding,'' <PERSON> Cook </PERSON> says. He said the fund was disappointed that the breeding facility it helped build in <LOCATION> Wolong </LOCATION> had only produced one panda, born in 1986. <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> <PERSON> Menghu </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Forestry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> says breeding has suffered from too little equipment and trained staff. But he says <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s efforts compared well with other countries, noting that few Western zoos with pandas have been able to produce surviving offspring. It was breeding and money that dragged the panda into the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> courts. In a suit still pending, the World Wildlife Fund and <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zoological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parks </ORGANIZATION> and Museums accused the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> of allowing commercial exploitation of pandas on loan to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> zoos from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. Six <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> zoos have borrowed separate pairs of pandas for short periods, paying <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> up to $ 500,000 and in turn reaping millions in ticket and concession sales. Dozens of other zoos are hotly competing for pandas. `` Our concern was that the number of loans was increasing sharply,'' <PERSON> Cook </PERSON> says. The lawsuit failed to stop the loan of two <LOCATION> Wolong </LOCATION> pandas to the <LOCATION> Toledo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, zoo in May. However, the Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> refused to let another panda pair be shown at the <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> State </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fair </LOCATION>, saying it would disrupt their breeding in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. It also suspended consideration of future panda loans, including one planned for the Atlanta Zoo for September, while it works out a new policy. Among other things, the service said it wants proof <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> uses the fees it gets for conservation. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s government has not responded, but its <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zoological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gardens </ORGANIZATION> announced a ban on panda loans where foreign organizations might profit, implying the commercialism was on the other side. <PERSON> Wang </PERSON>, of the <ORGANIZATION> Forestry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, said the halt in panda loans was <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s loss. `` It makes no difference to us,'' he says. `` It's not as if <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> goes around saying, ` Will you take a panda?' But <PERSON> Cook </PERSON> says he hopes the suit will make a difference, by ending <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s loans of breeding-age pandas and requiring <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> zoos to use panda revenues for conservation. `` We are not optimistic about the species right now,'' he says.

 In a pioneering program begun a year ago at a <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> clinic, doctors are making infertile women pregnant by taking eggs from a volunteer donor, fertilizing them with the sperm of the recipient's husband and implanting the eggs in the recipient's uterus. There have been some successes and some failures, but the director of the program says, `` We're on the right track.''

 Two women told repeatedly they were hopelessly infertile because they lack ovaries have become pregnant through an anonymous egg donor program. To protect their privacy, the <ORGANIZATION> Cleveland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clinic </ORGANIZATION> has closely guarded the identities of the two women, describing them only as in their early 20s, one a housewife and another a farm wife. One lives in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, the other in another state. `` These are women who have been told for years and years they would never get pregnant,'' says Dr. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Quigley </PERSON>, who directs the program at the clinic. `` They were as sterile as you could get.'' The two women are the first successes in a program that involves taking eggs from a volunteer, fertilizing the eggs with the sperm of the recipient's husband and implanting the fertilized egg in the recipient's uterus. `` As far as we know, we are the only people in the world that have a voluntary, anonymous egg donor program,'' <PERSON> Quigley </PERSON> says. Since the program began a year ago, eight women have undergone fertilized egg implants. In addition to the two pregnancies, four women have failed to become pregnant so far and two are awaiting pregnancy tests. `` We're on track,'' <PERSON> Quigley </PERSON> says. When the program was announced, the <ORGANIZATION> Cleveland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clinic </ORGANIZATION> received 500 inquiries in the first week, more than 90 percent of them from women interested in donating eggs to infertile women. Unlike sperm donors for artificial insemination, `` Women's eggs are a heck of a lot more difficult to come by than men's sperm,'' <PERSON> Quigley </PERSON> says. The clinic invited 68 women to go through a rigorous donor screening program which includes a medical history, psychological evaluation, detailed briefing on the procedure and the possible risk and a review by an ethical expert who makes sure the donor understands everything. A key part of the program, <PERSON> Quigley </PERSON> says, involves matching egg donors and recipients to try to provide women with babies similar in physical appearance to what they might have expected if they had become pregnant naturally. `` The matching has been incredible,'' <PERSON> Quigley </PERSON> says. He recalls that one day one of his aides familiar with one of the women in the matchup was able to pick out the other woman as she waited in a cafeteria line because they looked so much alike. He says the screening also weeds out donors who might have sexually or genetically transmitted diseases. The clinic and its staff make no promises about the type baby that might result. A recipient consent document also warns that `` there is no guarantee the recipient will become pregnant.'' The procedure usually takes about 20 minutes and can be uncomfortable, <PERSON> Quigley </PERSON> says. Donors are offered a painkiller. The eggs are combined with the sperm and up to three of the fertilized eggs are inserted into the would-be mother. Using more than three at a time would increase the chances of a multiple birth, <PERSON> Quigley </PERSON> says. Donors are paid $ 900 to $ 1,200 for their time involved in the screening, subsequent blood testing and the actual egg collection. `` We're certainly not paying for eggs,'' <PERSON> Quigley </PERSON> says. If the recipients become pregnant, they face up to 12 weeks of hormone treatments because they lack the ovaries needed to control the hormonal body changes required to maintain a pregnancy. `` We have to maintain the pregnancy artificially,'' <PERSON> Quigley </PERSON> says <PERSON> Lori </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON>, an expert on reproductive law with the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, says `` we could see a case'' in which a woman who donated eggs as part of her own attempt to become pregnant through in vitro fertilization might sue for visitation rights with a baby created with her donor eggs. But <PERSON> Quigley </PERSON>'s program faces less risk of such legal problems, she says, because donors are volunteers who are paid only for their time and effort. He said they have no hope themselves of becoming pregnant through in vitro fertilization. The only law in the nation regulating egg donations was enacted in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> to prohibit payments to a donor, Ms. <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON> says.

 <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON>, about to make his TV series debut, admits he still harbors some of the stage actor's prejudice against television. Cole, who lives in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> where he's a member of the Steppenwolf Theater, stars in <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s new `` Midnight Caller,'' which will makes its bow in November. He plays a former <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> police officer who continues to fight crime as host of a late-night call-in radio show. He'll also be seen this fall in the <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> movie tentatively called `` Daddy'' as a new father suddenly faced with raising his newborn son alone after his wife dies in childbirth. Cole is perhaps best known to television viewers for his performance as <ORGANIZATION> Green </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beret </ORGANIZATION> doctor <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> _ who was convicted of killing his wife and two daughters _ in the 1984 miniseries `` Fatal Vision.'' `` Sure, I've had prejudices against television,'' he says. `` I still do.'' But, he adds, `` There is quality television around.'' As for his new series, he says, `` I hope that it relies on character as well as on how it looks. I want it to have quality and be gripping.'' So far, <PERSON> Cole </PERSON>'s only work on the series has been the pilot. During the writers' strike he went back to <LOCATION> Chcago </LOCATION>, but recently returned here for `` Daddy.'' Work on the movie was completed in early September and he was off to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> to start `` Midnight Caller.'' `` I'm grateful for the opportunity to do a series,'' he says, `` but it's hard to know how to feel until it becomes a reality.'' Cole was doing `` Landscape of the Body'' at the Goodman Theater in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> when he was signed for `` Midnight Caller.'' `` The play was winding up a four-week run and I pulled out the last week,'' he says. `` But I got a few days off from the pilot and flew back to <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> to finish the play's run.'' Cole plays <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Killian </PERSON> in `` Midnight Caller.'' He is still a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> plainclothes inspector nicknamed `` The Mouth'' as the pilot opens. `` What happens is that he accidentally kills his partner during a shoot-out,'' he says. `` By his own choice he decides to stop being a policeman. Then he's offered this call-in radio show about crime prevention. It's people calling in about drug-selling in their neighborhood, battered wives, even a guy I busted as a policeman who calls in to harass me over the air. `` The pilot's about finding a female serial killer. She kills men. Married blond men. Then she begins to call the station. We try to trace the call. She winds up contacting me at home and we set up a meeting.'' Other regulars in the series are <PERSON> Wendy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kilbourne </PERSON> as the station owner, <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Dun </PERSON> as the producer-engineer and <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Taxier </PERSON> as his former boss and now his conduit to the police. Cole ca n't yet pin down <PERSON> Killian </PERSON>'s character. `` But the fact that he's called ` The Mouth' suggests to me he's outspoken and aggressive,'' he says. `` I think he's a little off-center. He's got a good sense of humor and he's outrageous on radio. When we filmed the radio scenes some of the questions were just thrown at me and I ad-libbed the answers.'' Cole grew up in the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> area, and for as long as he remembers wanted to be an actor. As an 8-year-old, he lip-synced <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Cosby </PERSON>'s comedy albums. He studied acting at <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, but left after three years to return to <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> to work as a bartender, house painter and occasional actor at the Steppenwolf Theater. He joined the Remains Theater in 1979 and then became an ensemble player with <LOCATION> Steppenwolf </LOCATION> in 1986. `` <LOCATION> Steppenwolf </LOCATION> has a company of 21 actors,'' he says. `` Some of the people have been working together since 1976. I knew most of them in college.'' His first film work was as <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON>' younger brother in the TV movie `` Heart of Steel,'' which told of the effect the closing a steel mill had on a community. The turning point was his appearance in `` Fatal Vision.'' `` I was doing <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Shepard </PERSON>'s play ` True West' in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and some <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> people saw it,'' he says. `` NBC talent reps came to <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> looking for people for pilots and I talked to them. I talked to them again when I did ` <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> Vice.' About three months later I got the role in ` Fatal Vision.' It turned out well. It got me in places I might not have gotten into before.'' Last year he starred in <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Wambaugh </PERSON>'s `` Echoes in the Darkness,'' based on a murder case in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>. He played a state police homicide investigator whose dogged work over seven years helped solve the case. He's also appeared on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Moonlighting'' and on `` The Twilight Zone.''

 <PERSON> Julie </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, who has spent much of the last seven years in television, has come home to the theater and a yearlong tour in `` Driving Miss Daisy.'' Not that she had deserted the stage completely while toiling on the CBS nighttime soap opera `` Knots Landing.'' Between seasons as the vulnerable, often silly and very southern Lilimae Clements on television, Miss <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> found time for short theater engagements, particularly in her one-woman shows based on the lives of <PERSON> Emily </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Charlotte </PERSON> <PERSON> Bronte </PERSON>. But `` Knots Landing'' occupied most of her career until she was written out of the show last fall. When last seen on the program, she and Red Buttons were riding off into the sunset in a motor home. Now the actress is on the road for real, this time in a tour that began in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> after Labor Day and will end next summer in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. Why submit to the rigors of touring? `` It's a perfect play,'' Miss <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> says in describing `` Driving Miss Daisy,'' which chronicles the 25-year relationship between an elderly <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> widow and her black chauffeur. `` There's an absolute truth about it,'' she adds. `` It's well-conceived and well-constructed It's like when you look in one of those small boxes and there are colors changing all the time. That's the way working on something like this is. It's never-ending: The little feelings that eddy out from all the scenes go into the next scene. The play, still running off-Broadway at the <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Houseman </PERSON> <PERSON> Theater </PERSON>, was a first effort by <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Uhry </PERSON> and won the 1988 Pulitzer Prize for drama. Touring with <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> are <PERSON> Brock </PERSON> <PERSON> Peters </PERSON> as the chauffeur and <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Root </PERSON> as her exasperated son. <PERSON> Uhry </PERSON> modeled the woman after his grandmother, an elementary school teacher. He and <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> talked at length about the woman who died in 1973 at the age of 95. He relayed bits and pieces of the woman's life to give the actress a better understanding of her character. `` For instance, he told me that his grandmother's curiosity was such that when she was reading she always had the dictionary beside her,'' Miss <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> recalls. `` She would look up words she did n't know, be carried away by what she was reading in the dictionary and would end up reading that. Miss Daisy is only the latest in a long parade of characters that the actress has brought to life on stage. She has won five <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> awards for her efforts. She found small jobs in the theater when she first moved to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> in the mid-1940s. `` I was sort of a young character actress so there was a niche for me _ the oddball girl,'' she recalls. Miss <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> astonished Broadway in 1950 when she played the lonely 12-year-old tomboy <PERSON> Frankie </PERSON> <PERSON> Addams </PERSON> in <PERSON> Carson </PERSON> <PERSON> McCullers </PERSON>' `` The Member of the Wedding.'' She was 24 at the time. Her co-star was <PERSON> Ethel </PERSON> <PERSON> Waters </PERSON> in what many consider her greatest role. `` Ethel Waters was a phenomenon of nature,'' Miss <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> recalls. `` She was like the force of <LOCATION> Niagara </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>. I've never experienced that same power from any other actress.'' The next year she won her first <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> award as the amoral hedonist <PERSON> Sally </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowles </PERSON> in `` I Am a Camera,'' adapted from <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Isherwood </PERSON>'s `` Berlin Stories.'' Other Tonys arrived for her portrayals of <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> of Ark in `` The Lark,'' a 40-year-old divorcee falling for a younger man in `` Forty Carats,'' <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Todd </PERSON> <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> in `` The Last of Mrs. <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>'' and poet <PERSON> Emily </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON> in `` The Belle of <LOCATION> Amherst </LOCATION>.'' Miss <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> carries on in the old tradition of such acting greats as <ORGANIZATION> Katharine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Lunt </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Fontanne </PERSON>, performers who go out on the road with their shows. `` I guess nothing could intimidate me anymore because I did ` The Belle of <LOCATION> Amherst </LOCATION>' for so long in huge barns, in tiny theaters, in middle-size theaters and on basketball floors,'' she adds. `` I even did six weeks of one-night stands,'' Miss <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> says. `` There was no time to adjust. You just slap the makeup on and do it. Some antenna tells you: ` too much voice' or ` too little voice.''' That instinct for acting was born early. `` I once heard an interview with <PERSON> Laurence </PERSON> <PERSON> Olivier </PERSON> who said both his parents loved the theater and so he ` inherited the wish,''' she says. `` That was his expression. I think I did, too, because both my parents adored the theater and took us to the theater and talked about the theater.'' By the time she was 14, she knew she wanted to be an actress. `` My parents were very tolerant,'' she says. `` I do n't think they took it seriously, although I did.'' Miss <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> still does, even after more than four decades of acting. `` I try to be adventurous, especially in rehearsal,'' she says. `` I must try it, and something will happen from trying it, even if what I'm doing does n't succeed. I've learned the value in saying ` yes' to everything. Eventually, you may have to say ` no,' but say ` yes' first.'' That sense of adventure extends to looking for new works, too. Today, she spends a lot of time reading scripts. `` Now I've taken an idea for a play to the Long Wharf Theater -LRB- in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Haven </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION> -RRB- and they've commissioned it to be written for <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> <PERSON> Robards </PERSON> and me,'' Miss <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> says. `` The play's about <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> and his wife. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Freed </PERSON> will write it, but I wo n't be able to do it until late next summer at the very earliest. But then, part of the excitement of life is to work on something new.''

<HEAD>Story Behind `Diamond Trap' Almost as Intriguing as Mystery</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD DE ATLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 `` The Diamond Trap,'' which leads off the season for the `` CBS Sunday Movie'' on Sept. 25, has career risks, corporate intrigue, tragedy and triumph. And a lot of it took place before the cameras rolled. The movie stars <PERSON> Brooke </PERSON> <PERSON> Shields </PERSON>, Twiggy, <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Hesseman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Marinaro </PERSON>, but the gold stars for putting it all together go to the executive producer, <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernstein </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bernstein </PERSON>, a former publicist and top <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> agent who boosted the careers of such performers as <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> and <PERSON> Farrah </PERSON> <PERSON> Fawcett </PERSON>, is not likely to produce `` The <PERSON> Mother </PERSON> <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON> <PERSON> Story </PERSON>.'' It would be too easy. Big script, big stars, lots of easy production money. Instead, <PERSON> Bernstein </PERSON> took a regulation thriller based on the novel `` The Great Diamond Robbery'' from mystery novelist <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Minahan </PERSON> and insisted on Miss Shields and <PERSON> Twiggy </PERSON> as the female leads for the script, which had been revised eight times over 2 -LCB- years by writer <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Peckinpah </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bernstein </PERSON> claims one of the best industry records for television movies, with the seven he has done so far averaging a 33 share, and none lower than a 31 share, the term used by <PERSON> A.C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nielsen </PERSON> to describe the percentage of the overall TV audience viewing a particular show. He knows how to hit the right audience buttons or, in his words, `` Put the sizzle in the steak.'' But wanting Miss Shields for the part and getting her were two different things. He made a point of going to this year's `` People's Choice'' awards to put the script in her hand. The role for Miss Shields was that of a gallery employee who is part of a plot to steal $ 12 million in jewels, but the police, including <PERSON> Twiggy </PERSON> as a <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> Yard detective, persuade her to help them foil the crime. The part of the sophisticated 30-year-old would be the first adult role for <PERSON> Shields </PERSON>, a 23-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Princeton </ORGANIZATION> honors graduate. She wanted it. But not everyone wanted her. She had to read for the role, for <PERSON> Bernstein </PERSON>, for director <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, for <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> and for <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION>, an unusual demand on someone who has already commanded major film roles. `` Certain people involved in the production were so worried about how to deal with a, quote, ` movie star' on a 22-day shooting schedule that the final compromise was to put part of my salary in escrow,'' said <PERSON> Bernstein </PERSON> in an interview. `` If there was a problem, the first money to be lost would be mine. `` I told <PERSON> Brooke </PERSON> I was going to do this and she said, ` Do n't worry, I wo n't let you down,''' he said `` Not only did she not let me down, she made me very proud. She is one of those people ... who everybody waits for to fail. And she's succeeded,'' said <PERSON> Bernstein </PERSON>. He called Miss Shields `` easy to work with and able to turn in a fine performance, even with all this pressure on her.'' There were other perils. The project came to <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> just as the network leadership was going through a shakeup, with <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> leaving the network and <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> LeMasters </PERSON> replacing him. `` It was about to be caught between the switches,'' said <PERSON> Bernstein </PERSON>. `` There was something CBS wanted from me, and it was hard to give, but I went in and gave it to them,'' said <PERSON> Bernstein </PERSON>. He did n't identify the sacrifice, but most likely it was a different movie or series project. `` And then I asked them for a favor afterward. ` Please let me do this and I wo n't let you down.' And now it's their leadoff movie,'' <PERSON> Bernstein </PERSON> said. But even after getting a green light, there was the matter of financing.. `` The problem was the picture was too expensive to make,'' <PERSON> Bernstein </PERSON> said `` This picture was filmed in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bristol </LOCATION>, Bath, <LOCATION> Wales </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, with four major stars, each of whom could be star of their own TV movie.'' In the midst of grappling with finances, <PERSON> Bernstein </PERSON>'s father, <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON>, died of complications from a heart condition April 17. <PERSON> Bernstein </PERSON> has dedicated the movie to his father. `` At the time my father died, the picture was falling apart,'' <PERSON> Bernstein </PERSON> recalled. `` On the day of my father's funeral, a person from <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> said to me, ` Do n't worry, it's going to work out.' And another person from <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> said the same thing. And they did it. `` That means there are people functioning in these corporations. They do n't get an opportunity very often to express their emotions, because everything is the bottom line. But I've seen CBS and <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> come through big, twice,'' said <PERSON> Bernstein </PERSON>. He also got the studio and the network to restore the `` Mike Hammer'' series to the air after star <PERSON> Stacy </PERSON> <PERSON> Keach </PERSON> was imprisoned in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> on cocaine charges. `` The Diamond Trap'' faces the Olympics on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> and probably a broadcast of the movie `` Romancing the Stone'' on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>, so <PERSON> Bernstein </PERSON> knows he will not match the previous shares he has gained for television movies. `` Whatever I get -LRB- in ratings share -RRB-, I would have gotten only half of it without these two women,'' <PERSON> Bernstein </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>At the Movies: ``Eight Men Out''</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LINDA DEUTSCH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 It seems unthinkable today that a major league baseball team could conspire to throw the World Series. But it happened in 1919. `` Say it ai n't so, <PERSON> Joe </PERSON>,'' were the words that echoed through history when the infamous `` Black Sox Scandal'' was mentioned. Writer-director <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sayles </PERSON> takes his cue from that line spoken by a young boy in fashioning `` Eight Men Out,'' a movie that is incisive, touching and instructive without appearing to be a history lesson. As the tragedy of the scandal unfolds, two young boys who idolized the players and cadged dimes to buy tickets to games become symbolic of the baseball fans whose dreams were tied to the champion <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sox </ORGANIZATION> team that seemed a shoo-in to beat the <ORGANIZATION> Cincinnati </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reds </ORGANIZATION> in the World Series. We meet the players at the height of their success, a team with the grace of ballet dancers, the naivete of children and the winning force of a steamroller. Hailed by the media and worshiped by fans, they are in constant conflict with the team's stingy owner, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Comiskey </PERSON>, a fine bad guy portrayal by <PERSON> Clifton </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON>. When sleazy gamblers including the infamous <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Rothstein </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Lerner </PERSON> -RRB- propose `` fixing'' the World Series, most team members are vulnerable. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Strathairn </PERSON> is a memorable example as <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Cicotte </PERSON>, the aging pitcher who is denied a bonus and agonizes over selling out for his family's sake. In true ensemble form, all of the performances are top rate. D.B. <PERSON> Sweeney </PERSON> is touching as the talented country boy <PERSON> Shoeless </PERSON> <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> whose inability to read or write makes him prey to corrupting pressures. It is he who turns away sadly from the child's plaint, `` Say it ai n't so, <PERSON> Joe </PERSON>.'' As the fix sets in, we see the expert players expertly losing game after game. In the press box, journalist <PERSON> Ring </PERSON> <PERSON> Lardner </PERSON>, coolly portrayed by <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sayles </PERSON> himself, and <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Fullerton </PERSON>, adeptly played by <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> writer <PERSON> Studs </PERSON> <PERSON> Terkel </PERSON>, become sadly aware that the team, soon to be derisively tagged `` The <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sox </ORGANIZATION>,'' has been corrupted. The case leads to formation of the baseball commission and appointment of the first commissioner, Judge <PERSON> Kenesaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Mountain </PERSON> <PERSON> Landis </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> -RRB- who punished all involved team members _ even those who did n't actively participate in the scam _ by barring them from professional baseball forever. This is a must-see film for baseball fans and an instructive entertainment for the rest of us. As writer, director and actor, <PERSON> Sayles </PERSON> hits three home runs. `` Eight Men Out'' is rated PG.

 `` Just Before the Bullets Fly'' -LRB- Epic -RRB- _ The <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> <PERSON> Allman </PERSON> Band Fans of the <ORGANIZATION> Allman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> wo n't be disappointed with founding brother <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON>'s latest solo effort, which echoes the patented Southern sound of the original group and paints a lyrical portrait of a rocker who has survived. <PERSON> Allman </PERSON>'s bouts with various chemicals are well-known, and on `` Just Before the Bullets Fly'' he deals with that image right off the bat. The first cut, `` Demons,'' has him singing, `` But oh, he's got his demons @ And they stay right by his side @ Through his everyday hell, yeah. Later, on `` Oceans Awash the <LOCATION> Gunwale </LOCATION>,'' he credits the music itself for saving him: `` Once more we're cheating on the reaper @ With all the gypsy still in our souls @ Cause I know there's a God up there somewhere @ Who must love rock and roll.'' And it's the music, particularly <PERSON> Allman </PERSON>'s throaty blues vocals, that keeps `` Just Before the Bullets Fly'' interesting. Guitarist <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Toler </PERSON>, formerly of <PERSON> Dicky </PERSON> <PERSON> Betts </PERSON>' Great Southern band, is the other major creative force here. His blues-rock licks are predictable: lots of long, ringing guitar solos that recall <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON>'s late brother, <PERSON> Duane </PERSON> <PERSON> Allman </PERSON>. But it's become a classic sound and <PERSON> Toler </PERSON> pays homage well. The title song, `` Demons,'' `` Ca n't Get Over You'' and a new version of `` Every Hungry Woman'' are vintage Allman-style blues. And <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> sings with a power and range you wo n't find on anything he's done since `` Eat a Peach.'' A couple of other songs fail. An attempt at jazz-rock, `` Thorn and a Wild Rose,'' sinks beneath the weight of its wash of synthesizers and mushy metaphorical lyrics. And a pop song, `` Night Games,'' forces <PERSON> Allman </PERSON> to try to sing bouncily _ and that's not his strength. But the rollicking, guitar-piano-and-organ sound that fans of the original <ORGANIZATION> Allmans </ORGANIZATION> know by heart, is alive and kicking on `` Just Before the Bullets Fly.'' And so is a rock' n' roll warrior, <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> <PERSON> Allman </PERSON>. _ By <PERSON> Curt </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> writer.

 `` Big Dreams in a Small Town'' -LRB- RCA -RRB- _ Restless Heart The problem with this kind of country-by-committee approach is that by the time everyone gets through, the result is much like a modern-day political platform _ it sounds nice enough, and it wo n't offend anybody, but it's nothing to inspire the masses With `` Big Dreams in a Small Town,'' Restless Heart gives us an album with 12 songwriters, seven producers, five vocalists, nine songs _ and, as a result, no focus. These five former <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION> session players have lodged themselves firmly in the Alabama-Oak Ridge Boys league, with mellow harmonies and professional musicianship. But while those groups have managed to meld into a distinctive identity, Restless Heart too often sounds like that staple of old-style country music shows _ the band playing a couple of tunes before the star takes the stage. `` The Bluest Eyes in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>,'' the current hit off this collection, is as good an example as any. What begins with a nice piano introduction from the classically trained <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Innis </PERSON> soon enough settles into nice harmonies that eventually pull lead singer <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> _ who really can sing _ into a nice vanilla morass. The first half has its moments: <PERSON> Innis </PERSON> with some crafty pop piano on `` Say What's in Your Heart,'' reminiscent of the early <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Joel </PERSON>; and a solid group effort on the title cut, a quintessential example of country pop. But things start to get a little adventurous in the second half, and not to good effect, either: a crowded swamp-Western-Indian air-of-mystery motif for `` <LOCATION> Eldorado </LOCATION>,'' and an unfortunate try at funkiness in `` This Time.'' With so many talented singers running around, Restless Heart still needs to find its voice _ or at least a chairman of the board. _ By <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> Writer.

 `` The Hits'' -LRB- Epic -RRB- _ <PERSON> REO </PERSON> <PERSON> Speedwagon </PERSON> <PERSON> REO </PERSON> <PERSON> Speedwagon </PERSON> has several strikes against it: banal lyrics, bland musicianship, the lack of a distinctive band personality. But they are unpretentious about their abilities _ no concept albums, no `` save the world'' singles, no 20-minute guitar solos. They just try to make hit singles and have often succeeded. The songs on `` Greatest Hits'' are at worst, uninteresting, and at best, instantly hummable. <PERSON> REO </PERSON> <PERSON> Speedwagon </PERSON> has lasted 20 years with only a couple of personnel changes, and the songs on `` Greatest Hits'' date from 1973 to the present. The band's limitations and strengths are typified by lead singer <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Cronin </PERSON>. He is n't terribly soulful, but <PERSON> Cronin </PERSON> does n't pretend to have a great voice and he handles fast songs and ballads equally well. The three best songs come from 1980's best-selling `` Hi Infidelity'': `` Keep on Loving You,'' `` Take It on the Run'' and `` Do n't Let Him Go.'' All have strong melodies and plenty of harmonies. They do n't hold up under close listening but sound good on the radio and the beach. Also included are the earlier singles, `` Time for Me to Fly'' and `` Roll With the Changes,'' and their most recent hits, `` Ca n't Fight This Feeling,'' and `` That Ai n't Love. _ By <PERSON> Hillel </PERSON> <PERSON> Italie </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> Writer.

<TEXT>
 `` Oh, he's a television actor,'' is a common Hollywood put down that <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> J </PERSON>. <PERSON> Fox </PERSON>, <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Selleck </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Willis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Danson </PERSON> have managed to overcome. Now <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Harmon </PERSON> faces the same sneer. The former Dr. <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Caldwell </PERSON> of `` St. Elsewhere'' has broken through with two major films this summer: `` The Presidio,'' co-starring <PERSON> Sean </PERSON> <PERSON> Connery </PERSON>, and `` Stealing Home'' with <PERSON> Jodie </PERSON> <PERSON> Foster </PERSON>. `` The Presidio,'' a big-budget production that basically bombed at the box office, featured <PERSON> Harmon </PERSON> as a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> police officer investigating a murder on an army base. In the more modest `` Stealing Home,'' he is a minor-league ballplayer on the skids, returning to his boyhood roots. Much of the film is told in flashbacks, and <PERSON> Harmon </PERSON> estimates he appears in only 30-35 minutes of the 93-minute running time. `` I'd like to think that being a part of bigger pictures gives you the opportunity to be a part of ones you feel more passionately about,'' he said. `` They're the ones that almost did n't get made for a lot of reasons. `` ` Stealing Home' is a project that has been around for seven or eight years, long before I heard of it. It's a project that was the passionate consideration and concern of <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Kampmann </PERSON> and <PERSON> Will </PERSON> <PERSON> Aldis </PERSON>, who wrote and ended up directing the piece as first-time directors.'' Last summer, <PERSON> Harmon </PERSON> made his movie debut as a star in the raucous comedy `` Summer School,'' directed by <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Reiner </PERSON>. He called it a turning point. `` Before ` Summer School,' nobody was knocking on my door and saying, ` Hey, we want <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Harmon </PERSON> to star in a major motion picture for a film company,''' he said. `` It was <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Reiner </PERSON> who actually took that by the horn and said, ` This is the guy I want to play the role.' The fact that <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Reiner </PERSON> had that belief in me and was indeed directing this summer fun movie made me willing to throw my hat in the ring and say, ` OK, let's try to make this thing work.''' <PERSON> Harmon </PERSON> was born into show business. His father is <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Harmon </PERSON>, 1940 Heisman Trophy winner at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> and a prominent sportscaster. His mother is <PERSON> Elyse </PERSON> <PERSON> Knox </PERSON>, actress in such 1940s movies as <PERSON> Abbott </PERSON> and <PERSON> Costello </PERSON>'s `` Hit the Ice'' and `` A WAVE, a WAC and a Marine.'' Still, he resists the notion that he grew up in <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>. `` It's safe to say that I grew up in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` Certainly not Hollywood. Hollywood seems to me very mainstream, something I'm not too attuned to and never have been; my folks sure were n't. I'm much better staying on the edge of it. I begrudgingly come into town when I have to. And yet I know this is where I work right now. `` My mother had stopped being an actress by the time I was born. I did n't even know much about my mom being an actress until I read about it in film books. I was 7 years old before some kid in the park told me that my dad was a world-class athlete and a great football player. I went home and asked him. That's the reality of how I was raised.'' <PERSON> Harmon </PERSON> first achieved prominence as star quarterback for the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> football team in 1972 and 1973. He was asked if there is any correlation between playing football and acting. `` There's some,'' he said. `` I know as an athlete I never played what I conceived as the perfect game, where everything went the way it was drawn on the chalkboard. That's the reason I played. It loved it; it was beautiful to watch when it all worked well. `` As an actor, I do n't see ever doing a role that you ca n't make better or change somehow. I like the fact that I can get up in the morning and hopefully grow and be better than when I started in the morning. `` Those are the same lessons I learned as an athlete. I do n't think it hurts to be competitive in this business It's best to work hard at what you do and try not to let the effort show. Underneath it all I'm pretty tough, and that comes from being an athlete.'' <PERSON> Harmon </PERSON> made his acting debut in an episode of `` Ozzie's Girls'' and played 22 other TV roles before breaking into features with the 1979 `` Comes a Horseman.'' His greatest exposure came as the AIDS-doomed doctor in `` St. Elsewhere'' and in the Coors beer commercials. A marketeer for the company once claimed that <PERSON> Mark </PERSON>'s credibility `` is right up there with <PERSON> God </PERSON> and <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Cronkite </PERSON>. <PERSON> Harmon </PERSON>, 37, is unswayed by such comments or his selection by <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> magazine </ORGANIZATION> as `` the sexiest man alive.'' Of his profession he remarked: `` This is what I do. It's a job, and I respect it as that. It's also about all I do I have a family, and I used to be a carpenter,'' said <PERSON> Harmon </PERSON>, who is building a family home at Big Bear, a mountain resort about 90 miles east of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. `` If this all disappears tomorrow I know I can still build houses.''

 <LOCATION> Harlem </LOCATION> street artist <PERSON> Franco </PERSON> the Great bebops a bit as he daubs the finishing touches on the belt of a dancing woman gyrating across a construction site fence. As he brings his own brand of <LOCATION> Harlem </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Franco </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaskin </PERSON> is completely oblivious to the trucks roaring past, the summer sun and the sweat beads streaking the lenses of his glasses. `` Nothing you do for love or beauty gon na die,'' he says, his arms spreading wide to take in a 100-foot mural of black men and women caught in the motions of the samba, the jitterbug and the bump. `` I know the Japanese have a different picture of blacks. I want them to understand the black people and their world.'' It's an intoxicating vision for a self-taught artist, a sailor's son who spent his boyhood in silence after a fall rendered him mute for 12 years To fill the void, <PERSON> Gaskin </PERSON> turned to art. After he recovered his speech he moved to <LOCATION> Harlem </LOCATION>, where a decade ago he decorated his first storefront riot grate. The depiction of a magnolia _ his `` Japanese blossom tree'' _ was the germination of the kind of greatness to which a lonely boy aspired. The work led to calls from other storekeepers _ more than 150 so far _ and a sort of international following after foreign travelers began touring <LOCATION> Harlem </LOCATION>'s avenues. <PERSON> Gaskin </PERSON> has demonstrated his technique before African art classes and painted murals for French municipalities. In July, he arrived in this <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> port city, summoned by Japanese developers who liked his raw style. <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Grand </PERSON>, as his paint-spattered coveralls proclaim, was charged with injecting American-style verve into a neglected suburb selected as the site for an international shopping district. `` We chose <PERSON> Franco </PERSON> because he's very good for wall paintings,'' said <PERSON> Tatsuo </PERSON> <PERSON> Nannichi </PERSON>, a publicist for the <ORGANIZATION> Honmoku </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Project </ORGANIZATION>. `` He worked in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, also <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, and he's a very international person. I think he's the symbol of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>.'' The Panamanian-born <PERSON> Gaskin </PERSON> has a theme he calls `` Harmony Among the Races.'' It has been a dream to paint it in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, where he hopes to find sponsors who will provide a more permanent backdrop. `` When we look at racism, in my world I'm dealing with black and white, but never with yellow, never with brown people, red people,'' he says. `` Black and white is a contrast. But it takes three or more colors to make harmony. And since <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> is a most powerful nation, I figure it takes <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to link a lot of people around the world.'' The project must wait until his next visit. For now, <PERSON> Gaskin </PERSON> is happy that he's made a start. `` I planted a seed in <LOCATION> Harlem </LOCATION> and now the seed has grown into a beautiful tree,'' he said. `` I wanted <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to share a little bit of the black culture.'' After two weeks' work, <PERSON> Gaskin </PERSON>'s charcoal outlines were filled with browns, oranges and magentas set off by a sky-blue backdrop. His section of corrugated steel canvas runs along a four-lane thoroughfare, side by side with other temporary murals by Japanese artists and art students. In <PERSON> Gaskin </PERSON>'s painted world, everyone is smiling. Silver sparks fly from tambourines, elbows jut, hands clap, a good bit of thigh shows as a chubby lady twirls her skirt. `` I do n't know art well, but I feel this is live <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> modern art. Fantastic,'' said <PERSON> Kazuhiko </PERSON> <PERSON> Kitagawa </PERSON>, a bank clerk and <PERSON> Franco </PERSON> fan. `` I saw his art in <LOCATION> Harlem </LOCATION> last year, and I met him. He was wearing the same clothes.'' On a recent Sunday, <PERSON> Gaskin </PERSON> presented a Franco Award to one of the Japanese art students. Standing on a cloth-covered box in his coveralls, his 6-foot-5 frame crowned by a colorful straw hat from a nearby festival, <PERSON> Gaskin </PERSON> read the proclamation in stumbling Japanese to the student, who shook his hand and scurried away. `` Japanese artists will get incentive from his art,'' <PERSON> Kitagawa </PERSON> said. `` If Japanese paint, it becomes imitation. He is real art.''

<HEAD>Music Makers: The Personal Touch for Musical Success</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SARATOGA SPRINGS, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>

 If the musical gods were to prophesize that a black woman who sang heart-tugging folk ballads would top the charts in 1988, you'd figure it would be a very good year for <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Armatrading </PERSON>. After all, whoever heard of <PERSON> Tracy </PERSON> <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON>? But no one ever said the gods were fair. <PERSON> Armatrading </PERSON>, whose name frequently comes up when critics talk about <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON>'s work, is still searching for that elusive hit 15 years and 13 albums into her recording career. She quickly brushes off questions about the runaway success of <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON>'s debut record, saying she has n't heard her music. A & amp; M Records does n't shy away, however. In advertisements for <PERSON> Armatrading </PERSON>'s new album, `` The Shouting Stage,'' the company says that while hundreds of singers are compared to her, `` hundreds of thousands of her fans knew she was there first.'' The company is banking on the current mini-revival of the singer-songwriter era to give <PERSON> Armatrading </PERSON> a long-sought boost to stardom. `` Personally, I think it's unfair that <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> has n't had the same breaks that <PERSON> Tracy </PERSON> had,'' said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Corson </PERSON>, executive director of product development for A & amp; M. `` It's more of a question of timing. <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> blazed the trails and <PERSON> Tracy </PERSON>'s taken advantage of it.'' Actually, there is n't much to the comparisons between <PERSON> Armatrading </PERSON> and <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON> beyond the superficial similarities. <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON>, in her debut album, features quiet, introspective folk songs about love and society's treatment of the downtrodden. <PERSON> Armatrading </PERSON> sticks to personal politics, her emotionally intense music an often exuberant mixture of rock, reggae, jazz and folk. The songs are so achingly personal that people often assume they're all autobiographical, which would have given <PERSON> Armatrading </PERSON> a pretty full emotional life over the past decade and a half. `` I think of it as a compliment, because the songs are written to be believed,'' she said before one of the early dates in her current <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> tour. `` They're generally from something that's happened ... It's just that it's not necessarily from my things. But I write it as if it's about me.'' The new album's title cut comes from a magazine article that theorizes every couple must go through a period of fighting to achieve true intimacy, she said. The song is written in the voice of a woman addressing her lover in the wake of this `` shouting stage,'' her tone veering between resignation and vulnerability. More controversial is `` The Devil I Know,'' a searing indictment of a `` wandering'' man from a woman trying to keep him close to home that's already been taken to heart by many feminists. `` One chap said to me that the difference between men and women is that men can distinguish between lust and love,'' she said. `` A man can have a one-night stand or an affair that lasts a couple of years and feel that he's being quite faithful to his real partner because it's a purely sexual thing. `` It's women who have trouble thinking that if you go to bed with someone you do n't love them,'' she said. `` We'd like the two to go together.'' The song, she said, is about the age-old double standard that seems to accept this behavior from men and condemn it from women. If someone thinks they've happened upon an album of men-bashing, `` The Devil I Know'' is immediately followed by the cheery `` Living for You,'' about the happy side of being wrapped up in a relationship. <PERSON> Armatrading </PERSON>'s live show is packed with playful energy, almost mocking the stereotypes of the singer-songwriter genre. She bounces across the stage and trades some slightly choreographed dance steps with saxophonist <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON>. The highlights come when she straps on an acoustic guitar for a bluesy `` -LRB- I Love It When You -RRB- Call Me Names'' and a version of <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON>'s `` Moondance.'' Her albums have become progressively harder-edged throughout the 1980s, but `` The Shouting Stage'' quiets things down a bit. It has a highly produced, jazzy sound, benefitting from such studio stars as <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Knopfler </PERSON> and <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> of Dire Straits. As much as she liked it at the time, <PERSON> Armatrading </PERSON> said she ca n't listen to her 2-year-old album `` Sleight of Hand'' without pulling the needle from the vinyl Some of the songs, she admits, she finds `` irritable.'' `` I was trying to write an album that I hope in a couple of years' time people can sit and listen to just as much as they do today,'' she said. Her record company will settle for people listening to it now. <PERSON> Corson </PERSON> said he's encouraged by the company's sales performance in the first few weeks of its release, though disappointed by radio's continued reluctance `` I think it's a time of opportunity for us,'' he said.

<HEAD>Books and Authors: Turning Best Sellers Into Hot TV</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 On the seventh floor of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Mayfair </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hotel </ORGANIZATION>, actress <PERSON> Lindsay </PERSON> <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON> was preparing the climactic scene in the TV movie `` Voice of the Heart.'' The one-time `` Bionic Woman'' faced a difficult moment: She must persuade her on-screen lover, <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickson </PERSON> -RRB-, that her past actions are less hateful than they once seemed. `` Do you need holding?'' asked director <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Wharmby </PERSON>. <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON> nodded `` yes,'' and <PERSON> Wharmby </PERSON> walked over to bolster her confidence by hugging her. The scene is a buildup to the confession on which hangs the plot of <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradford </PERSON>'s 1983 best-selling novel, whose TV version will be aired in two 2-hour segments this winter over <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> and in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on a network that has not yet been announced. The $ 8 million movie promises all the ingredients of high-class soap opera: a web of romance and deception, exotic foreign locations, and an emotionally storm-tossed heroine named <PERSON> Katharine </PERSON> <PERSON> Tempest </PERSON>, played by <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON>. `` Voice of the Heart'' is the third <PERSON> Bradford </PERSON> book to be adapted for the screen. She began writing 40 years ago at the age of 12 when, as a youngster in an upper middle-class family in <LOCATION> Leeds </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, she sold her first story about a girl and her horse to a children's magazine `` I think my destiny was sealed,'' she recalled in an interview. However, her writing was put on hold while she set out to experience life. `` I do n't think you can earn a living at the age of 16 writing novels.'' In her eagerness to gain that knowledge, she shunned college and became a typist at the <ORGANIZATION> Yorkshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Evening </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>. She was promoted to cub reporter in six months. A year later, at age 18, she became women's page editor and by age 20 moved to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s renowned newspaper row, Fleet Street. She married American film producer <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradford </PERSON> in 1963 and moved to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. At the time, she was writing a syndicated column on interior design that ran in 185 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> newspapers. However, the desire to write fiction began to nudge her. She started her first novel in 1970, and had started three others by 1975. Then came `` A Woman of Substance,'' which she called the story of `` a strong woman who makes it in a man's world when women were not doing that.'' `` When I started to write those initial pages, I really felt very excited because I somehow knew in my bones ... this was the book I was going to finish and the book that would be right,'' she said. The hardcover version has sold more than 11 million copies since 1979, and the paperback topped <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> best-seller list for 43 weeks. It also was made into an acclaimed syndicated TV miniseries. Her second, `` Voice of the Heart,'' sold 2.5 million copies in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Her third, `` Hold the Dream,'' was also a best seller. `` Voice of the Heart'' co-stars <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Brolin </PERSON> as the dashing actor-director <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> and <PERSON> Victoria </PERSON> <PERSON> Tennant </PERSON> as <PERSON> Francesca </PERSON> <PERSON> Cunningham </PERSON> <PERSON> Avery </PERSON>, the historical biographer who vies with actress <PERSON> Katharine </PERSON> for <PERSON> Victor </PERSON>'s affections. `` There's a whole person in there, and the person's hurting,'' said the 39-year-old <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON> in an interview halfway through the 10-week shooting schedule. `` I've got to humanize her, to make her emotionally accessible to people,'' she said, looking sleeker and more composed than she would later that afternoon when she donned a bathrobe to play the frazzled <PERSON> Katharine </PERSON>. `` She's a very exaggerated kind of character in the fact that she's eccentric and neurotic. ... In the story, if we do n't sympathize with her, then there's no pay-off at the end. <PERSON> Victoria </PERSON> <PERSON> Tennant </PERSON> said she was drawn to the premise of the film. `` The drama pivots on a white lie that is told that seems harmless to the liar and yet devastates the lives of everyone involved,'' said the soft-spoken English actress. `` I think it's quite telling,'' she said of the plot idea. `` When you think of all the information that is being thrown at you and how you deal with it, you think, `` That's not impossible. You could hear something and it could change your life.''' `` Voice of the Heart'' is a contemporary drama, said the elegantly coiffed <PERSON> Bradford </PERSON>, whose `` A Woman of Substance'' and `` Hold the Dream'' also were made into TV movies. They dealt with the department store dynasty of <PERSON> Emma </PERSON> <PERSON> Harte </PERSON>, and starred <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerr </PERSON>. `` It's very up-to-date; it's got a touch of the present,'' she said. `` Katharine is one of those strange, mixed-up weird women.'' Like <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bradford </PERSON> insisted that <PERSON> Katharine </PERSON> arouse sympathy. `` She's not a bitch,'' the writer said. `` She's a complex and complicated woman and a marvelous actress, who has this frigidity which all goes back to the time when she was molested as a child.'' Although her novels have been filmed and a fourth, `` Act of Will,'' is to follow, <PERSON> Bradford </PERSON> said: `` If I wrote a book with the ultimate goal of a TV or movie screen, I think I'd be cheating the reader. `` I'm actually competing with TV because I want to hold the reader. I do n't want the reader saying, ` Oh, This is just a lot of dialogue. I ca n't visualize any of it; I'm going to turn on ` War and Remembrance.''' She insists on having her husband as executive producer on all her TV adaptations. `` A lot of <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> producers buy a best seller, keep the title and throw the contents away,'' she said. `` <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> believes you put on-screen the story that's in between those two covers.''

<HEAD>Nashville Sound: Soviet Singers Spread Patriotic, Religious
Message</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DICKSON, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Two Russian gospel singers are spreading a message of Christianity and speaking out against communism, which they say drove them from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> Pankratz </PERSON> and his brother <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> are leaders of the six-member, gospel-rock band <PERSON> Ruscha </PERSON>. The slick, hard-driving group is on the road doing 150 concerts a year, playing mainly for youngsters who hear 90 minutes of rousing music and then 15 minutes of religious and patriotic messages. `` We are cruising across <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, grabbing people by the neck and saying, ` Wake up. You've got it good but you are taking your freedom for granted and you should n't do that. One day you may wake up and be under persecution yourself,''' said 31-year-old <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON>. `` People do n't believe that will happen,'' he said. `` But we grew up under communism, and we have a very great fear of it spreading across the world.'' The brothers said their family was persecuted in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> for being Christians and attending underground churches. In 1963, they said, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> secret police came to their house and took their grandfather away. `` He was dragged out in the deep snow in his pajamas,'' said 29-year-old <PERSON> Peter </PERSON>. `` He pointed toward heaven, meaning he'd see us again. That's the last time we saw him. He arrived in a casket two months later. He had frozen to death in <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION>.'' The two said their family of eight, after four years of negotiation, paid $ 3,000 a person to leave the country in 1974 and relocate in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, where an aunt lived. `` There's no way to leave unless you sell everything you have,'' <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> said. `` We sold the only cow we had, the chickens we had, the pigs we had. We sold our house and other people pitched in and helped us financially.'' From <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, the brothers came to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on student visas, <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> in 1978, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> a year later. Learning English without formal lessons, they studied at the Word of Life bible institute in upstate <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> for a year. They then enrolled at <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Liberty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Lynchburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, where they received undergraduate degrees. `` He really helped us out,'' <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> said about <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON>. `` We did n't know anything about <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. He kind of took us under his wing. Our whole life in this country started right there. We sang in his church and on his TV show. He financed an album and got us into his school.'' The two have since decided to make their home in <LOCATION> Dickson </LOCATION>, about 40 miles west of <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION>. They first began performing under the name <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION> but learned that the name had a bad connotation in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Because of the name, their touring bus was vandalized several times. `` We got fed up and did something about it,'' <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> said. `` Americans do n't realize there could be good Russians.'' They changed the spelling to <PERSON> Ruscha </PERSON>. The two-year-old band now consists of the brothers plus Americans <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Denton </PERSON>, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> and <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Beck </PERSON>. Their debut album, `` Come Alive,'' was released earlier this year. Their first single is `` Come Home,'' which has been No. 1 on the gospel-rock charts in many cities. Their concerts are mostly in auditoriums and some in churches. `` We play some places no one else goes,'' <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> said. `` People are getting to know us. That's pretty good. `` We want to get a message across through our music. It's a vehicle. We try to tell the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people that people do n't know what it's like under communism. Also, we'd like to educate them that it's a dangerous thing and that there is an answer to life: God. `` What we are trying to do is what a lot of people of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> are failing to do: be able to grab kids' attention and say, ` Do n't be a lazy bum Support your government. Support your country. Stand up for the rights of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.' `` If we're able to change the young people's attitude toward the country, change their lifestyle away from drugs and alcohol and sex and homosexuality, then I think we've done a whole lot more good than 99 percent of the churches in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' The brothers are not <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens, but this is a goal. `` We'd love that more than anything else,'' <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> said.

<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>

 Do n't expect the Tower of Babel to tumble, but computer scientists are breaking down language barriers with machines that can translate languages in seconds and recognize speech regardless of accent. `` Where can it lead to?'' said <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> Assistant Director <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Wulf </PERSON>. `` How big is your imagination?'' Need to call <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>? Hotel switchboards, within a few years, will be able to connect English-speaking callers to a special computer that translates their words into Japanese, then responds by machine in English. Stuck in a foreign hospital? Patients and doctors who speak different languages will be able to communicate via computer in about a decade. Traveling abroad and ca n't speak the language? Forget a dictionary. Plan on packing a pocket translator. Too busy to type information into the computer? Just dictate. The list goes on and on, including eyeglasses for the deaf with screens that provide transcripts of conversation, and the ability to order merchandise like plane tickets by talking on the phone to computers. `` One of the most distinguishing characteristics of human beings is our ability to communicate,'' <PERSON> Wulf </PERSON> said. `` What you're seeing here are techniques that improve that ability.'' Companies are beginning to cash in on voice recognition programs even while experts are trying to make the computers capable of dealing with the ambiguity of human language, bad grammar and different accents, among other things. `` We need to reduce the costs and increase the size of the vocabulary and increase the capabilities,'' said <PERSON> Raj </PERSON> <PERSON> Reddy </PERSON>, director of <ORGANIZATION> Carnegie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mellon </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Robotics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. `` All of those are yet to be solved.'' `` What is there is obviously a very significant improvement over what we used to know how to do even six months ago.'' <ORGANIZATION> Dragon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Newton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, developed a program <ORGANIZATION> Xerox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> used in 1986 to save nearly $ 10 million by inventorying all 2.2 million of its parts for the first time, said <ORGANIZATION> Dragon </ORGANIZATION> assistant marketing manager <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON>. The $ 100,000 system recognized 1,000 words. A 5,000-word program is out, and a 20,000-word version is expected by early 1989, said <PERSON> Robbins </PERSON>. Dragon also is working with the federal <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advanced </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Projects </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> to develop a voice-controlled jet fighter cockpit. <ORGANIZATION> Kurzweil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Applied </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Waltham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, has developed voice recognition systems for radiologists and emergency rooms. Doctors dictate their reports to a computer, and the reports are printed. The programs originally recognized 1,000 words, but the vocabulary has been expanded to 5,000. More than 100 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> hospitals use the radiology system, VoiceRAD, and about a dozen have VoiceEM for emergency rooms, said spokesman <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON>. Both Dragon and <PERSON> Kurzweil </PERSON>'s systems require brief pauses between words and must be trained to recognize each speaker. `` Most of us do n't speak properly most of the time,'' said <PERSON> Reddy </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Artificial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION>. `` If you transcribe anybody's voice ... there are all types of pauses and repetition, hums and haws, which we know how to ignore. Computers do n't know that yet.'' `` Either we have to come up with ways to deal with -LRB- this -RRB- or we have to teach people to speak right,'' said <PERSON> Kai-Fu </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Carnegie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mellon </ORGANIZATION> researcher who has developed a speech recognition system known as <PERSON> Sphinx </PERSON>. It's a slow, complex task because human language is rife with ambiguity, unlike mathematical, scientific or computer language. Take, for example, this sentence: `` The box is in the pen.'' `` For humans, it's obvious because we all know that the box can not be in the writing pen -LRB- through -RRB- our unconscious kind of common sense,'' said <PERSON> Masaru </PERSON> <PERSON> Tomita </PERSON>, associate director of the <ORGANIZATION> Carnegie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mellon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Translation </ORGANIZATION>. `` If you want computers to do this, it's going to be very difficult,'' <PERSON> Tomita </PERSON> said. `` The computers have to know the typical size of a box and the typical size of a pen. One thing we can do very quickly is that whenever the word ` pen' appears, we can assume it's a writing pen. But on the other hand, then the system will make mistakes.'' A classic example of machine misinterpretation involves the epigram, `` The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.'' Early translating systems turned that into, `` The vodka is good, but the meat is rotten.'' <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>'s Sphinx, unlike earlier systems, can identify English words spoken continuously. It boasts up to 96 percent accuracy identifying 997 words, people do n't have to spend hours training it to recognize their speech patterns, and minor variations in accent pose little problem. `` It's the first system that has all these capabilities,'' said <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, 26, who has been working on Sphinx for 1 -LCB- years, funded by the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advanced </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Projects </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Sphinx </PERSON> transforms spoken words from changes in air pressure into changes in voltage. Each 10-millisecond slice of sound is assigned a string of digits and, through a mathematical process, matched with other sequences to yield the word with the best possible meaning. So time is n't wasted searching the entire vocabulary, <PERSON> Sphinx </PERSON> takes syntax into account. <PERSON> Tomita </PERSON>, 30, who plans to work this fall with <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, has developed a system capable of recognizing 100 words of doctor-patient dialogue in Japanese, then translating the Japanese into English uttered by a computer's speaker. The computer transforms the spoken Japanese into its written equivalent, which is translated into written English and sent to another part of the computer that generates English speech. <PERSON> Tomita </PERSON> also has devised a program that translates written English or Japanese into written English, Japanese or German. A hypothetical exchange between a doctor and patient _ `` I have a headache'' or `` Take two aspirin'' _ is typed into the computer and the translation appears within seconds. Like Sphinx, <PERSON> Tomita </PERSON>'s 1,000-word systems consider context. He hopes to increase the programs' vocabularies and eventually expand them to conversation used in making hotel reservations and registering for conferences. His work is funded, in part, by <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. `` We need to pick some domain where it's very, very defined, always clear what you're talking about,'' he said. The need for translating systems is considerable, especially for those not fluent in English, according to <PERSON> Tomita </PERSON>, who counts himself in that category. There are more than 3,000 world languages and dialects, said <PERSON> Jaime </PERSON> <PERSON> Carbonell </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Translation </ORGANIZATION>. `` Americans do n't seem to be aware of the fact that maybe 90 percent of the world population does n't speak English at all,'' said <PERSON> Tomita </PERSON>. `` But everywhere you go, there is somebody who can speak English.'' Because of that smugness and sense of superiority as well as insufficient funding, machine translation has received scant attention in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> since the 1960s, experts say. Most work has been in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. `` The man on the street may or may not directly benefit from a machine translation system,'' <PERSON> Wulf </PERSON> said. `` On the other hand, he may benefit indirectly from American scientists being able to interact better with the <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> or the Japanese or the French scientists.''

 Computer scientists have machines talking, but linguists and philosophers are in demand to help put the words in their mouths. `` The last few decades have really seen a kind of merger of a technical tradition in the humanities. That merger has created a lot of opportunities,'' said <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> <PERSON> Glymour </PERSON>, head of <ORGANIZATION> Carnegie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mellon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s philosophy department. `` More people are being drawn into it, and not for the traditional reasons.'' In general, `` programmers are a dime a dozen,'' <PERSON> Glymour </PERSON> said. `` What is needed are people who can take vaguely formed problems and find ways to make them precise enough to be programmed.'' American colleges and universities conferred 41,889 bachelor's degrees in computer science and 40,521 in psychology during the 1985-86 academic year, the latest figures available from the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION> That compares to 3,265 in philosophy and 470 in linguistics. To help meet the demand for computer-conscious philosophers and linguists, <PERSON> Carnegie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mellon </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> linguistics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> department </ORGANIZATION> have developed a doctorate program in computational linguistics The goal is to produce people who can do more than merely write computer programs based on others' ideas, who can, in fact, develop programs that better understand and emulate how humans talk and think. `` You ca n't have really robust, healthy technology without a science behind it, and we do n't yet have the science,'' said <PERSON> Richmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomason </PERSON>, professor of linguistics and philosophy at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION>. `` So what we have to do is learn enough about human language and reasoning to understand what it is we're trying to do once we get these machines to do something. Sixteen students have been accepted into the program, one of only a few in the world, in its two years of existence. Those skilled in the area have landed high-paying, high-powered jobs, unlike many of their more traditional brethren. `` There is a certain kind of stereotype about philosophy that's quite popular,'' <PERSON> Glymour </PERSON> said `` Think about what would distress a parent more than to pay a hefty tuition and discover <PERSON> Sammy </PERSON> or <PERSON> Samantha </PERSON> is going to study philosophy. The stereotype is a completely impractical and perhaps an even self-indulgent endeavor. `` The fact of the matter is ... 20th century philosophy has created through various pieces of work all kinds of technical traditions.''

 A 70-foot dinosaur known as `` Happy'' stood prominently on display at the <ORGANIZATION> Cleveland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> History </ORGANIZATION> for nearly 25 years before researchers discovered it was a new species. Four months before it announced that finding in July, the museum said it had discovered a new dinosaur, <LOCATION> Nanotyrannus </LOCATION> _ based on a skull that had been in the basement for decades. This spring, a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> researcher found the fossil remains of a marine reptile called a Masasaur, so well-preserved that the 75 million-year-old animal still had scales on its skin and food in its stomach. It was in a Natural History Museum of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> warehouse. Paleontologists say the finds are n't surprising. Museum storerooms have become rich hunting grounds for new species because a lack of money and staff has delayed the identification of bones excavated up to 60 years ago. `` In general, paleontologists can collect stuff faster than it can be prepared,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, who helped identify `` Happy,'' a 140-million-year-old relative of the Brontosaurus. `` There are museums ... which have skeletons still in plaster jackets going back to the turn of the century.'' Researchers at the <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> museum had determined that `` Happy'' was a Haplocanthosaurus, but did n't realize it represented a new and larger species _ and named it `` delfsi'' after the researcher who found the bones 30 years ago _ until they recently had time to study it more closely. `` Literally there is so much material to collect and save from weathering and erosion that we are just decades behind,'' said <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON>, curator of vertebrate paleontology at the Natural History Museum of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. `` I could walk in to the Smithsonian or any museum and find 80 or 90 new species of whales or dolphins, which is my specialty.'' <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON> estimated that the museum had 300 to 400 plaster jackets in storage, encasing everything from dinosaurs to mammoths, and that 75 percent of the museum's collection has not been examined closely. Even at the well-funded <ORGANIZATION> Smithsonian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION>, it took half a century to study and identify fossils excavated by 19th century dinosaur researcher O.C. <PERSON> Marsh </PERSON> that form the bulk of the museum's collection, according to research curator <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hotton </PERSON> `` When <PERSON> Marsh </PERSON> died, we got seven big, big train carloads of dinosaur bones,'' <PERSON> Hotton </PERSON> said. Researcher C.W. <PERSON> Gilmor </PERSON> worked on <PERSON> Marsh </PERSON>'s fossils for nearly 50 years, and `` there is a bunch of stuff <PERSON> Gilmor </PERSON> did n't get to.'' Fossils stored at the <ORGANIZATION> Smithsonian </ORGANIZATION> have almost all been identified, he said. `` We do n't anticipate any surprises, but that's silly because we can always get surprised.'' Field Museum of Natural History researchers in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> have spent 10 years working through the collection of unstudied fossils, some of them in storage for decades, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bolt </PERSON>, chairman of the geology department. `` We've made quite a bit of progress at reducing that backlog,'' <PERSON> Bolt </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Dawson </PERSON>, curator of the <ORGANIZATION> Carnegie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> History </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>, said some of the fossils still stored in plaster jackets at the museum date to 1922. With only five paleontologists on the staff, many of those blocks will have to remain in storage. Four years ago, a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> grant let <ORGANIZATION> Carnegie </ORGANIZATION> researchers open an old plaster block. They found the only known complete hind foot of a stegosaurus. `` We liken our collection to an iceberg, with one-tenth above the surface and the rest waiting for study,'' Miss <PERSON> Dawson </PERSON> said. Most of the work done at the museum is based on specimens the researchers collect themselves, so much of the collection in storage will remain unstudied, she said. `` We know we should stay home and study the collections we already have, but it's such a challenge to get out in the field. `` We're really putting apples back on the tree when we do this.''

<TEXT>
 Doctors may be too quick to prescribe powerful new cholesterol-reducing drugs with unknown long-term effects when exercise, change of diet or more proven drugs might do as well, specialists say. `` There is a general suspicion that some of the drugs that control cholesterol are overprescribed, when diet and weight loss alone may suffice,'' said Dr. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Willerson </PERSON>, professor of medicine and chief of cardiology at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. If exercise and diet do n't work in four to six months, drugs ranging from the proven, like bile acid resins and niacin, to the new, like gemfibrozil and lovastatin can be useful, said Dr. <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Peters </PERSON>, an assistant professor at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION>. Lovastatin lowers the blood's low-density lipoprotein, which delivers the cholesterol that builds up in the arteries. Gemfibrozil increases the levels of high-density lipoprotein, which carries cholesterol away to be destroyed. The two drugs `` are so easy to take, so impressive in their effects on lowering cholesterol, that many physicians start out with them first, which is not an <ORGANIZATION> NIH </ORGANIZATION> recommendation,'' <PERSON> Peters </PERSON> said recently in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> has designated colestipol, cholestyramine and nicotinic acid, or niacin, as drugs of first choice. The first two are bile bile acid resins, which have been been available for more than 20 years. `` The two newer drugs can also be considered,'' said <PERSON> Peters </PERSON>, an assistant professor of medicine and preventative medicine and biometrics who addresses doctors' groups and consumers on cholesterol-lowering drugs. `` But most cholesterol experts think they should only be considered after patients are using niacin and bile resins in small doses.'' Lovastatin `` is very effective in lowering the LDL component,'' he said. `` It is quite well tolerated, a pill like gemfibrozil. But the longest it was used in humans is five years. We have really no idea what the long-term safety record will be. `` Practicing physicians are overprescribing that medicine without giving patients an informed choice ... ` Do you want a little inconvenience but we know it's safe, or would you rather choose convenience and a question mark as far as Lovastatin safety.''' Lovastatin was approved in 1987 by the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. It can be very effective, <PERSON> Willerson </PERSON> said. `` Lovastatin is a very important medication, but the newer cholesterol-fighting drugs are very powerful, and it is important to be aware of what the options are.'' `` I think there are some problems in that area,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunninghake </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prevention </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clinic </ORGANIZATION> and author of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cholesterol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION>'s adult drug therapy guidelines. `` These come from many different areas. `` One is patients are not given adequate time or instruction on diet. That is related to the fact that physicians are not familiar with dietary therapy yet. The other is that many physicians are not real familiar with the bile acid resins and nicotinic acid and do not have a true feel for incidence of side effects and the number of patients who can tolerate these drugs.''

<HEAD>Human Safety Trials Underway For AIDS Decoy Drug</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The first human trials have begun to test the safety and proper dose of an experimental drug that may act as a decoy to attract the deadly AIDS virus and prevent it from invading human blood cells. About 50 patients with acquired immune deficiency syndrome or the less severe AIDS-related complex are participating in the six-month studies of the drug, called rCD4, that began last month at <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Deaconess </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. Tests of the drug's effectiveness against AIDS will begin only after the safety and dosage trials are complete, the researchers said. The drug is a manufactured version of CD4, a protein on the surface of white blood cells, the main targets of the AIDS virus. The virus infects white blood cells by latching onto the CD4 protein. Scientists hope injected rCD4 molecules might act as decoys so AIDS virus particles in a patient's blood latch onto the rCD4 instead of real CD4 on white blood cells. In that way, the drug might slow the virus' ability to spread from cell to cell, thereby slowing or halting the progression of AIDS in an infected person. It also might prevent white blood cells from being infected if it is given immediately after a person has gotten the virus in the bloodstream.

<HEAD>Aerial, Satellite Photos Can Locate Homes For Endangered Birds</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Satellite images and aerial photographs can provide a cheap way of finding <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> islands suitable as new homes for endangered birds, a researcher says. <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON>, a graduate student in geography at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barbara </LOCATION>, said by using aerial photos and computer-processed satellite images of the <LOCATION> Cook </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> she could distinguish tropical forest, swamp, brushland, fern thickets and cultivated areas. Such information can be used to determine which isolated, uninhabited islands are suitable for reintroduction and successful reproduction of endangered birds, <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> said. Habitat information is prohibitvely expensive to obtain from field studies because because islands are spread over millions of square miles of the western <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>, she said. Aerial photos of the <LOCATION> Cook </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> can be bought for $ 2,500. Where aerial photos do n't exist, satellite images can be bought for about 10 times that amount, but that's still cheaper than conducting on-the-ground field studies or new aerial surveys, she said. In the past 2,000 years, <LOCATION> Polynesian </LOCATION> hunters eliminated or sharply reduced populations of many land birds from many islands in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>. `` That is no longer a problem, but the remaining birds are threatened by habitat destruction as well as introduced predators, particularly cats, rats and mongeese,'' said <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON>, who hopes to protect endangered species by reintroducing them on uninhabited islands where they once thrived. <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> outlined her study Aug. 16 at an <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Biological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> meeting.

<HEAD>Permanent Voice Damage Can Result If Minor Laryngeal Injuries</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 Untreated
</TEXT>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Experiments on voice boxes removed from cadavers suggest that minor injuries to the larnyx may cause permanent damage to the voice if left untreated. Car crashes, chokeholds, strangleholds and other blunt-force injuries often cause minor fractures to the cartilage framework of the larynx, or voice box, which contains the vocal cords. Such fractures usually are n't treated unless they interefere with breathing, said Dr. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON>, an assistant professor at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION>. However, <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> said his study suggests such fractures can `` cause long-term hoarseness or limit the range of pitch and pitch control.'' The fractures, while difficult to diagnose, can be detected by CAT scans and treated by intricate surgery in which wires are inserted into the voice box to restore proper alignment of cartilage, <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> said. In the <ORGANIZATION> USC </ORGANIZATION> study, voice boxes were removed from five dead people and mounted on a special apparatus, both in their normal condition and after minor injuries were simulated. Warm, humid air was passed through the voice boxes in a manner similar to that in which a person speaks. Analysis showed that even minor fractures reduced the efficiency of each larynx in regulating air flow during the production of sound, suggesting more laryngeal fractures should be treated than is customary, <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> said.

 Getting in touch with your feelings and thinking positively about yourself are fine, but the best way to stave off the pangs of jealousy are to just get on with your life, two psychologists say. A positive attitude about yourself, or self-bolstering, seems to be the best way to prevent the depression that could follow jealousy, but does n't do much to much to keep away envy or jealousy itself, the researchers say. `` We like to think getting in touch with your feelings is a good thing, that exploring how you feel will make you feel better,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Salovey </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> assistant professor of psychology. `` But we found that strategy actually made you feel worse in jealousy-producing situations.'' Those who are jealous of others' success may long to curl up with a bowl of ice cream while recalling every word of praise ever uttered by family, friends and acquaintances, but that does n't help, said <PERSON> Salovey </PERSON>, who has studied jealousy for five years with <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> professor <PERSON> Judith </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodin </PERSON> `` Ignoring your feelings and getting on with your daily work and striving even harder ... for what you want works better,'' <PERSON> Salovey </PERSON> said. A third coping strategy, selective ignoring, works in the short run by invoking the attitude, `` it's not so important to me anymore,'' he said. `` But I suppose there is a limit to how many times you can do that. Nothing is going to be important to you ... if you employ it all the time.'' <PERSON> Salovey </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rodin </PERSON> asked 95 <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> undergraduates in 1986-87 to rate the frequency of jealousy-provoking situations involving school, family, friends and romance, how jealous they felt and how they coped. Their research will be published in the fall issue of the Journal of Social and Clinical Psychology. Jealousy is the worry that something you have will be lost to someone, and envy is wanting something someone else has. `` To the extent they do not run your life, they may be healthy and helpful,'' <PERSON> Salovey </PERSON> said. `` They are negative in what people is often a lot of anger, sadness and occasionally fear. But in the sense they can also help enrich our lives by letting us now what is important to us, that's not so negative.

 Unemployment climbed to 5.6 percent in August as the number of jobless Americans grew by 226,000 and a four-month hiring boom in the nation's factories ended abruptly, the government said. Analysts said the news announced Friday reflected a softening job market and was just the `` cold shower'' an overheating economy needed.

<HEAD>Gold Swindles on Rise</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Thousands of jittery investors are jumping from the frying pan of a volatile stock market into the fire of gold swindles pushed by high-pressure telephone sales operations, state regulators said today. The <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administrators </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, together with the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Better </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureaus </ORGANIZATION>, issued an `` investor alert'' warning of a rash of high-pressure, boiler-room telephone scams promoting various schemes to buy gold at below-market prices. `` We hope to alert the public to what is clearly the fraud du jour _ one that has earned the title: the fool's gold rush of 1988,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON>, president of the regulators' group and director of the <ORGANIZATION> Tennessee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Division </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>. Project Goldbrick, a New Mexico-based task force established by the regulators, began tracking eight scams in the spring of 1987. Since then, <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON> said, the number of known operations has mushroomed to 52. He estimated `` tens of thousands of Americans in all 50 states will lose $ 250 million'' this year. `` It seems clear that the success of the new breed of gold swindle is attributable in large part to the decline in investor confidence since the Black Monday stock market crash of October 1987,'' <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON> said in a statement. `` Thousands of individuals fled the markets,'' he said. `` The result: a huge pool of potential, cash-rich victims ripe for exploitation.'' The typical scheme, known as a `` dirt pile,'' works like this: A caller working from a boiler room telephone operation in another state offers to sell, for instance, 100 tons of dirt for $ 5,000. The con artist guarantees the `` aggregate ore'' will yield at least 20 ounces of gold, an effective price of $ 250 an ounce vs. current spot market prices of about $ 430 an ounce. `` The problem is the gold does n't exist beyond microscopic, economically unrecoverable levels,'' <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON> said. `` The mine probably is nothing more than a godforsaken patch of desert scrubland.'' The regulators' organization tested the ore in one <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> mine, billed by salesmen as the richest mineral deposit on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. It turned out to have no more gold than is found in sea water, <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON> said. In another case cited by the group, a <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> inmate already jailed on a fraud charge used prison telephones to bilk investors in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> into paying $ 6,250 each for worthless dirt from an inactive <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> mine. When he was caught the second time, prison authorities moved him to solitary confinement. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> McIlhenny </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Better </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureaus </ORGANIZATION>, said virtually all of the swindlers operate by telephone. `` It's easy to start: just rent a cheap office, install banks of phones, hire salespeople and start calling from sucker lists. ... If things get too hot, they simply close up shop, move to another town ... and start running a new scam,'' he said. The two groups offered tips for avoiding a gold swindle: _ Hang up on high-pressure telephone sales tactics _ Beware of vague promises about delayed delivery of gold _ Remember that there is no such thing as a `` guaranteed'' investment in gold _ Ignore such terms as `` secret,'' `` special'' or `` ca n't - be-duplicated'' methods _ Do n't be swayed if a mine is supposedly on federal land It costs only a few dollars to establish such a claim. _ Gold and platinum do n't mix, so reject assertions that a mine has high levels of platinum along with gold or silver _ Take time to make your decision and get everything in writing _ Official-looking mineral content analyses, known as assays, mean little Assayers can be crooked, or they can be duped by a sample that has been `` salted'' or comes from another mine. _ Be suspicious of companies insisting on special arrangements for receipt of investments Some con artists try to evade mail fraud penalties by sending a courier to pick up an investment check or sending a pre-paid envelope from an overnight mail service. _ Before investing, check out a promoter with your state securities office or with one of the 174 Better Business Bureaus around the country `` Why people will commit their life savings over the phone, when they would n't think of buying a car or a house sight-unseen in the same way, is a continuing and troubling mystery to those of us whose job it is to promote investor protection,'' <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON> said. `` Investors are going to have to learn that when someone offers to sell them a dollar bill for 60 cents, the correct response is to just say no,'' he said.

 The stock market rose this morning, further strengthening gains made last week on a buying surge based on signs that the economy may be slowing down and easing pressure on interest rates. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which ended last week with a gain of 37.16 points, was up 8.00 to 2,062.59 by 10 a.m. EDT. The market was closed Monday for Labor Day. Among broader market indicators, the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>'s composite index of all listed issues rose 0.44 to 150.10 The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>'s market-value index rose 0.60 to 296.22. Gaining issues outnumbered declines by more than a 5-to-3 ration on the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>, with 566 up, 332 down and 454 unchanged. <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> volume totaled 17.86 million shares after the first half hour of business. On Friday the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrial average jumped 52.28 to 2,054.59 for its biggest one-day gain since it rose 74.68 points on May 31.

<HEAD>Societe Generale Names New Board Members After Takeover</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Carlo </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Benedetti </PERSON>, the Italian financier who earlier this year tried to take over <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>'s largest holding company, was one of 20 new board members elected to the company's board Tuesday Shareholders of <ORGANIZATION> Societe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Generale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Belgique </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SA </ORGANIZATION> endorsed the new board during a special meeting called to set up a new management structure for the company following its bitter takeover battle earlier this year. In addition to <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Benedetti </PERSON>, three of his allies were named to the board: <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Rene </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Banque </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nationale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paris </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Alain </PERSON> <PERSON> Minc </PERSON>, the chief of <ORGANIZATION> Cerus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SA </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Benedetti </PERSON>'s French holding company. <ORGANIZATION> Societe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Generale </ORGANIZATION>'s Chairman <PERSON> Rene </PERSON> <PERSON> Lamy </PERSON> said he would remain until the spring shareholders meeting. He will be succeeded by <PERSON> Etienne </PERSON> <PERSON> Davignon </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commissioner </ORGANIZATION>, who is expected to play a major role in the company's restructuring. The new board met after the vote to set in motion a major restructuring of the giant company that has stakes in some 1,300 companies worldwide involved in, among others things, mining, energy, financial services, chemicals and engineering. Analysts have said <ORGANIZATION> Societe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Generale </ORGANIZATION> badly needed to be shaken up. They said its status as <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>'s largest holding company had allowed it to retain an antiquated management structure that had changed little since its founding in 1822. The 166-year-old company was the target of a highly public takeover battle earlier this year between <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Benedetti </PERSON> and a consortium of Belgian and French companies, led by <ORGANIZATION> Compagnie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financiere </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Suez </ORGANIZATION>. Financiere, a French financial group and the single largest <ORGANIZATION> Societe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Generale </ORGANIZATION> stockholder, had joined with <ORGANIZATION> Groupe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AG </ORGANIZATION>, a Belgian insurance group, to oppose <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Benedetti </PERSON>'s takeover bid. In the end, the two camps struck a compromise power sharing deal after neither could gain an outright majority stake. As part of the deal, <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Benedetti </PERSON> was to be named vice chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Societe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Generale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Belgique </ORGANIZATION> and given control of three other board seats. <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> had played a major role in <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Benedetti </PERSON>'s attempt to take over <ORGANIZATION> Societe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Generale </ORGANIZATION>. The 203 shareholders at Tuesday's meeting represented some 40.5 million of <ORGANIZATION> Societe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Generale </ORGANIZATION>'s 42.7 million shares. <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> became an investor last spring in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> 1992, a company set up and controlled by <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Benedetti </PERSON> to hold shares in <ORGANIZATION> Societe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Generale </ORGANIZATION>. The new board said 1988 dividend should `` at least'' equal the 1987 payout of 115 Belgian francs per ordinary share -LRB- $ 2.90 -RRB-. It said it would raise 1988 dividends on AFV shares, a special type of share issued under a Belgian tax plan that allows higher dividends. The 1987 payout for <ORGANIZATION> Societe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Generale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AFV </ORGANIZATION> stock was 143.65 francs -LRB- $ 3.60 -RRB- a share, down from 187.55 francs -LRB- $ 4.69 -RRB- in 1986. <ORGANIZATION> Societe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Generale </ORGANIZATION>'s net profit fell 22 percent in 1987 to 4.14 billion francs -LRB- $ 103.5 million -RRB- from 1986.

 Crop futures prices opened mostly higher today on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> amid continuing optimism that exports of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> grain and soybeans are on the rise. Wheat futures have been quietly rallying for about two weeks and opened today near the highs set earlier this summer. The near-month wheat contract, for September delivery, was above $ 4 a bushel in early trading. Near-month wheat reached $ 4.07 a bushel on July 5. Soybean futures were higher in reaction to strong European markets while corn prices were little changed. Although rainfall was in short supply this summer, farmers increasingly are hoping for dry weather as the corn and soybean harvests advance, analysts said. `` Especially in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, where they've got a lot of weak plants, winds, rains, anything like that probably will knock those yields down,'' said <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Freed </PERSON>, grain market analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. In early trading, wheat was -LCB- cent to 2 cents higher with the contract for delivery in September at $ 4.03 a bushel; corn was unchanged to 1 -RCB- cents lower with September at $ 2.90 -LCB- a bushel; oats were 1 -LCB- cents to 3 cents higher with September at $ 2.62 a bushel; soybeans were 5 -LCB- cents to 8 cents higher with September at $ 8.79 a bushel. Livestock and meat futures were mostly lower in early trading on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Live cattle were unchanged to .63 cent lower with October at 71.37 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .18 cent to .72 cent lower with September at 81.15 cents a pound; hogs were .87 cent lower to .60 cent higher with October at 37.65 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .20 cent to 1.80 cents lower with February at 46.85 cents a pound. Cattle futures settled higher on Friday while pork futures were lower. The markets were closed Monday for the Labor Day holiday.

 The stock market strengthened slightly this morning in what brokers called post-Labor Day buying interest caused largely by the big runup of the previous session, but trading remained light. `` All the big boys are back from the beach with lots of cash, but I think they're still waiting to see what's going on,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Toole </PERSON>, manager of over-the-counter trading at <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` This is just a carryover from Friday's nice rush.''

 Share prices closed slightly higher Tuesday but sharply off their peak levels as the market slid in late trading in the wake of declining <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> prices. However, volume levels remained low, making it difficult to draw any firm conclusions about market sentiment, analysts said. At the end of trading, the <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times-Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> 100-share index was up 3.5 points, or 0.2 percent, at 1,768.0.

The narrower <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> 30-share index was up 5.5 points at 1,426.0. A volume of 326.7 million shares changed hands, compared with 284.8 million Monday. The Financial Times `` 500'' share index was 1,003.69, up 3.06 points. `` It's difficult to see where the good news is going to come from, if not from Wall Street,'' said one analyst on <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s late afternoon slide. `` Cash-rich institutions are thinking, ` why invest money now when we're not convinced that good news is on the way.'''

 The stock market strengthened slightly today in what brokers called post-Labor Day buying interest caused largely by the big runup of the previous session, but trading remained light. `` All the big boys are back from the beach with lots of cash, but I think they're still waiting to see what's going on,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Toole </PERSON>, manager of over-the-counter trading at <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` This is just a carryover from Friday's nice rush.''

<HEAD>Wheat Futures Hit 2-Month High</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Wheat futures prices closed sharply higher at two-month highs Tuesday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> on a variety of signs construed as bullish for export sales. Other grains and soybeans also gained. The Canadian government's estimate that <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> would harvest 15.4 million metric tons of wheat, the smallest crop in 13 years, helped spur the wheat market, which had been rallying quietly for about two weeks, analysts said. The wheat production estimate issued Friday by <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canada </ORGANIZATION> compares with the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s latest estimate that the Canadians would harvest 18 million bushels of wheat this year. The report prompted concerns that <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> may be forced to reduce its wheat exports. New bids for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and expectations of new demand from other countries _ including the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> _ also supported wheat futures, said <PERSON> Katharina </PERSON> <PERSON> Zimmer </PERSON>, a grain analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Markets </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` There is something afoot with the <LOCATION> Russians </LOCATION>,'' she said. `` Apparently there are some Russian visitors in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. We do n't know who they are or what they're doing but the fact is it was a lot more bullish on the wheat market than the corn market.'' Wheat futures closed at their highest levels since July 5, when the year's highs were set. At the close, wheat was 6 cents to 10 -LCB- cents higher with the contract for delivery in September at $ 4.10 a bushel; corn was 3 cents to 5 \ cents higher with September at $ 2.93 -LCB- a bushel; oats were 8 cents to 11 -LCB- cents higher with September at $ 2.71 a bushel; soybeans were 8 -LCB- cents to 17 cents higher with September at $ 8.89 a bushel

 The stock market strengthened slightly today because of post-Labor Day buying interest in the aftermath of the big runup during the previous session, although trading remained slow. Brokers said many of the large institutional investors that are crucial for substantial rallies remained out of the market, reflecting an underlying caution about committing money to stocks without more information on the direction of the economy and interest rates. `` A lot of guys are sitting with flat positions, because taking positions could kill you in this market,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Toole </PERSON>, manager of over-the-counter trading at <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. But he said that `` if the institutions come in, this market will roar on the upside.'' The market's strong gains on Friday stemmed largely from increased optimism about stocks and bonds based on evidence that the economy is slowing down, easing upward pressure on interest rates. The most potent evidence was a rise in August unemployment reported by the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. While some stock strategists were disappointed by the market's weak volume today, others said they were encouraged because prices did n't retreat on profit-taking, regarded as a sign of increased confidence `` Despite the fact that volume has n't accelerated dramatically, the underlining bias is distinctly positive,'' said <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Peroni </PERSON>, a technical analyst at the <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Janney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Montgomery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scott </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` Most stocks are behaving well.''

<HEAD>Pork Futures Plunge On Rising Supplies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Pork futures posted steep losses Tuesday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> with frozen pork belly prices plunging their permitted daily limit of 2 cents a pound on indications of a sharp increase in hog supplies. On other markets, energy futures fell dramatically; grains and soybeans were higher; precious metals were lower; and stock-index futures advanced. The weakness in pork was rooted in the cash hog markets, where larger-than-expected supplies of market-ready hogs pushed prices down $ 1.50 to $ 2 per hundredweight, said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Hare </PERSON>, livestock market analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Upham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` It was just a matter of too many available for what demand was coming,'' he said. Kills also were higher than expected with an estimated 321,000 hogs slaughtered Tuesday compared with 307,000 on the same date a year ago. An unusually large spring pig crop will ensure against supply problems this fall, and the amount of pork bellies and other pork products in cold storage remains at near-record levels. The bearish sentiment spread to the adjacent cattle pits, where selling led to a modest deflation of cattle futures prices, <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION> said. Live cattle settled .30 cent to 1.03 cents lower with the contract for delivery in October at 70.97 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .10 cent to .62 cent lower with September at 81.07 cents a pound; hogs were 1.27 cents lower to .60 cent higher with October at 37.55 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were 1.77 cents to 2 cents lower with February at 1.98 cents a bushel. Crude-oil futures plunged to their lowest levels since October 1986 on signs of continuing discord within the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, analysts said. `` There had been hope that the <LOCATION> Iran-Iraq </LOCATION> peace process would have ushered in a new period of <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> cooperation. Instead it appears that <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> has dissolved and it looks like we're on the brink of a price war,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Beutel </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Elders </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Reports that one <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> member, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION>, was openly flaunting <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> crude-oil production quotas `` makes a complete mockery'' of the cartel's price-support efforts, <PERSON> Beutel </PERSON> said. West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 36 cents to 55 cents lower with October at $ 14.24 a barrel; heating oil was 1.17 cents to 1.39 cents lower with October at 41.71 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was 1.05 cents to 1.45 cents lower with October at 42.53 cents a gallon. Wheat futures prices on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> settled at their highest levels since July 5 _ when the year's highs were set _ on a variety of signs construed as bullish for export sales. Other grains and soybeans also gained. A Canadian government estimate that <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> would harvest 15.4 million metric tons of wheat, the smallest crop in 13 years, helped spur the wheat market, which had been rallying quietly for about two weeks, analysts said. The report Friday from <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canada </ORGANIZATION> prompted concerns that <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> may be forced to reduce its wheat exports. New bids from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat and expectations of new demand from other countries _ including the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> _ also supported wheat futures, said <PERSON> Katharina </PERSON> <PERSON> Zimmer </PERSON>, a grain analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Markets </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> announced aftr the close that private exporters had sold 550,000 metric tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corn to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> for the 1988-89 marketing year and that another 252,400 metric tons of corn had been switched to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> from other destinations. Wheat settled 6 cents to 10 cents higher with the contract for delivery in September at $ 4.09 -LCB- a bushel; corn was 1 -RCB- cents to 5 cents higher with September at $ 2.93 -LCB- a bushel; oats were 8 cents to 11 -LCB- cents higher with September at $ 2.71 a bushel; soybeans were 8 -LCB- cents to 17 \ cents higher with September at $ 8.88 a bushel The inflation-sensitive precious metals futures declined modestly on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, reflecting the opposing tugs of lower oil prices, which was bearish, and higher grain prices and a weaker dollar, which were bullish, analysts said. Gold settled $ 2.60 to $ 2.70 lower with October at $ 429.20 a troy ounce; silver was 3.3 cents to 3.8 cents lower with September at $ 6.485 a troy ounce. Stock-index futures advanced slightly on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, where the contract for September delivery of the <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's 500 index settled .80 point higher at 266.40.

 The stock market advanced Tuesday because of increased buying interest from a pre-Labor Day surge, but the trading level remained slow and signaled cautious behavior by large influential investors. `` I do n't see any brand new money rushing in,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Toole </PERSON>, manager of over-the-counter trading at <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` All the big boys are back from the beach with lots of cash, but I think they're still waiting to see what's going on. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks, which jumped 52.28 points Friday for the biggest one-day advance in three months, added another 10.67 to close at 2,065.26. Broader market indicators also rose. But <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> volume totaled only 122.25 million shares, considerably less than the 159.84 million traded in the Friday session, when the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s report that unemployment rose in August incited some enthusiasm in the markets because it eased fear of inflation. The weaker volume Tuesday disheartened some strategists who had been hoping for a more substantial boost in buying interest by large institutional investors following the three-day Labor Day break. `` I'm disappointed,'' said <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, head of institutional trading at the <ORGANIZATION> Baltimore </ORGANIZATION> firm of <PERSON> Alex </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Brown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sons </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. On the other hand, he said, `` People coming back from vacation are n't going to spend the first day buying and selling It does n't surprise me, the volume as light as it is. Others said they were encouraged because the market did n't retreat on profit-taking, historically a sign of anxiety about the short-term direction of stocks `` Despite the fact volume has n't accelerated dramatically, the underlining bias is distinctly positive,'' said <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Peroni </PERSON>, technical analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Janney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Montgomery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scott </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. `` Most stocks are behaving well.'' Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 4-to-3 in nationwide trading of NYSE-listed stocks, with 808 up, 626 down and 505 unchanged.

 The dollar declined against most major currencies Tuesday pushed down by a wave of selling after the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency market reopened following the Labor Day weekend. Gold prices also fell after a mixed performance overseas. <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> said gold was bid at $ 426.60 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EDT, down from $ 429 late Friday. Currency brokers said activity in the foreign-exchange market slowed with the dollar trading in a narrow range following Friday's selloff in advance of the holiday weekend Friday's activity was sparked by a higher-than-expected unemployment figure that showed the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy may be weakening. The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported unemployment rose 5.6 percent in August, from 5.4 percent in July. Friday's selloff was followed by a further weakening of the dollar in foreign markets Monday, while <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency markets were closed. Analysts said after last week's activity, investors were turning their attention to this week's report on the Producer Price Index, an important measure of inflation, and next Wednesday's <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit figures. `` The dollar market will be a side market until then,'' said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Barbanel </PERSON>, first vice president with <ORGANIZATION> Gruntal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co.. Inc. in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Traders said the markets are likely to remain cautious in advance of the fresh data. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where the trading day begins, the dollar fell 0.43 yen to a closing 135.60 yen. Later, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it was quoted at 135.68 yen. At the end of the trading day in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the dollar was down 0.85 yen at 134.925 yen. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the dollar fell against the British pound. It cost $ 1.7035 to buy one pound, almost two cents more than $ 1.6860 late Monday. Later in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the pound fetched $ 1.70365, compared with $ 1.6850 late Friday. Other late-dollar rates in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> compared with levels late Friday included: 1.84015 West German marks, down from 1.8524; 1.5530 Swiss francs, down from 1.5567; 1.23405 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2355; 6.2695 French francs, down from 6.2915; 1,378.00 Italian lire, down from 1,381.50.

 <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>'s top rivals in personal computers have called a news conference for next Tuesday at which they are expected to announce an alternative design for the way information flows inside a personal computer. The new design would make it possible for the companies to build personal computers that rival <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>'s 1 -LCB- - year-old Personal System-2 line without departing so far from the older standard, analysts said Tuesday <ORGANIZATION> Compaq </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> is leading the challenge, which may eventually include as many as 30 companies that make personal computers or related products, said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Weil </PERSON>, an analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Gartner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. Calling the news conference for Tuesday in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> are <ORGANIZATION> Compaq </ORGANIZATION>, Japanese-owned <ORGANIZATION> Epson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> NEC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Hewlett-Packard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> NEC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s Ing. <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Olivetti </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Tandy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Wyse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Zenith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION>. The joint project could put additional competitive pressure on <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>, but it might also help <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> by serving as an acknowledgement that its new Personal System-2 line has features that are worth duplicating, <PERSON> Weil </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> could benefit if the delay in bringing the new computers to market gives <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> a chance to get its line better established, said <ORGANIZATION> George </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colony </ORGANIZATION>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Forrester </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. Colony said he thought creating a new standard was a bad idea because, `` There would be further confusion on the part of the users, and that would translate into slower sales.'' The new standard is for a `` bus,'' something which controls the way information flows through a computer. The more advanced models of <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>'s Personal System-2 line use a new bus called Micro Channel. <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>'s rivals use the older bus that was used in <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>'s PC AT. <PERSON> Weil </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>'s rivals will claim that their new bus offers all the power of <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>'s Micro Channel but allows people to continue using their older add-on equipment, such as circuit cards. <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>'s Micro Channel requires users to buy all new add-on equipment <ORGANIZATION> Compaq </ORGANIZATION> declined comment on the reports. <PERSON> Weil </PERSON> said that in addition to the companies calling the news conference, <ORGANIZATION> Intel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Microsoft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> have played a role in developing the new standard. The story was broken by PC Week, a trade newspaper, in this week's editions.

<HEAD>Cocoa Consumers Ask Producers To Pay Debts</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Nations that consume cocoa appealed Tuesday to countries that produce it to pay their debts to the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cocoa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>'s fund to stabilize falling world prices. The organization, composed of 37 cocoa consuming and producing nations, faces a shortfall in covering operating costs in the cocoa year that runs from October 1988 to September 1989, said delegates to the cartel's two-week conference, which opened Monday. Cocoa-producing nations owe almost $ 70 million to the group's price-stabilization fund The biggest debtor is the <LOCATION> Ivory </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>, which owes $ 48 million. <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> owes $ 9 million. Other debtors include <LOCATION> Cameroon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ghana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> on Tuesday paid a separate $ 146,700 it owed to the group's administrative fund, said its chief delegate <PERSON> Lindenberg </PERSON> <PERSON> Sette </PERSON>. The shortfall in the price-stabilization fund would also leave the organization unable to finance a proposed new stockpiling scheme aimed at supporting prices, now at their lowest for seven years. Operating costs for 1988-89 are estimated at $ 23 million. The organization estimates it will have only $ 10 million to $ 12 million on hand when the new cocoa year starts Oct. 1. The organization may sell cocoa from its current stockpile of 250,000 metric tons to meet the budget shortfall. The organization's secretariat has drawn up plans to sell 10,000 tons in 1989 and 15,000 in 1989-90.

 Car and truck sales fell 10.7 percent in August, compared with the same month last year when incentives called for quicker buying decisions by consumers, the automakers and analysts said Tuesday. Foreign and domestic vehicle makers, except <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sales </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said they sold 1.25 million cars and trucks last month, compared with 1.35 million during the same month last year. For the 10-day period ending Aug. 31, <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said its sales of U.S.-made cars inched up 2.6 percent compared with the same period last year. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, meantime, said its car sales for the period fell 1.4 percent and <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> reported a 13.9 percent drop. Each of the Big Three reported increases in car sales so far this calendar year. <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Edd </PERSON> <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON> said a dealer incentive program that stretched through the Labor Day weekend delayed computation of the company's monthly figures. <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Kade </PERSON> said Tuesday that figures for the month had n't been calculated. Both automakers said their sales figures would be announced Wednesday. `` The kinds of incentives that are on this year are normal run-of-the-mill incentives that have been on the cars for a long time,'' said auto analyst <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> DeScenza </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Nomura </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. `` There's no incentive to buy now to take advantage of current incentives,'' he said. A year ago, car makers offered attractive incentives, including cut-rate financing as low as 1.9 percent for <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> vehicles, to lure customers into showrooms and shrink inventories with just one month left in the model year. Those incentives frequently involved short-term offers such as low financing and cash-back deals. This year the incentives are different. `` The incentives are sustainable kinds of things,'' <PERSON> DeScenza </PERSON> said. `` Incentives have a big impact when it's clear to the car buyer that they are not going to be around very long. `` Everybody knew -LRB- last year -RRB- they were temporary,'' he added, `` that they would n't last forever. Everybody knew that the models that qualified for them were in limited supply and dwindling rapidly.'' <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Grady </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Integrated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Automotive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Wayne </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, agreed, saying last year's incentives colored the sales figures this year. `` Certainly we're going to be down -LRB- in sales -RRB- from last year,'' he said. `` These are certainly very strong sales.'' <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> showed declines in late-August and monthly sales while <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> showed increases during the two periods. There were nine selling days in both late-August periods and 27 sales days in August of this year, compared with 26 in August of 1987. For the Aug. 21-31 period this year, <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> said it sold 32,214 cars made in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, 2.6 percent higher than the 31,388 it sold during the same period last year. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> sold 65,600 U.S.-made cars during the period, a 1.4 percent decrease from the 66,515 cars it sold during the same time last year. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s late-August sales fell from 126,629 last year to 108,986 this year, a drop of 13.9 percent. For the month, the No. 1 automaker sold 284,056 cars, off 20.7 percent from 345,098 in August 1987. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s monthly sales dropped 6.2 percent from 182,824 in August 1987 to 178,023 last month. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> showed the only monthly gain among the Big Three, rising from 75,156 U.S.-made cars in August of last year to 82,366 cars last month _ a 5.5 percent increase. `` Chrysler has been more aggressive than the other two in using incentives to stimulate sales ...'' <PERSON> DeScenza </PERSON> said. `` There's an implication that they're buying the sales -LRB- with incentives -RRB-.''

<HEAD>Setback For Pernod In Fight For Irish Distillers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A multimillion-dollar merger battle over the whiskey giant, <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Distillers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, was in the balance Tuesday night after a watchdog body for <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s City financial district rejected an appeal by European bidders. The British Panel on Takeovers and Mergers threw out an appeal by <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Pernod </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ricard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SA </ORGANIZATION> against a panel decision allowing British rival hotel and leisure group, <ORGANIZATION> Grand </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, to sweeten its hostile bid by launching a `` knockout'' bid offer. The fight is three-cornered as British brewers, <PERSON> Watney </PERSON> <PERSON> Mann </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Truman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION>, are also seeking to control the Irish company. On Wednesday, the legal battle shifts to <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Pernod </PERSON> is trying to stop a key shareholder selling its stake to Grand Met. After days of suspense, <PERSON> Pernod </PERSON> formally made a 244 million pounds sterling -LRB- $ 415 million -RRB- bid for <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Distillers </ORGANIZATION> on Monday, but Grand Met raised its original 180 million pounds -LRB- $ 306 million -RRB- offer to 284 million pounds -LRB- $ 483 million -RRB-. The Grand Met offer amounts to 525 Irish pence a share from an earlier 400 Irish pence a share. The Pernod bid is worth only 450 Irish pence a share. On Sunday, the executive of the takeover panel ruled that was acceptable for Grand Met because it gave shareholders the opportunity to decide the best offer. This was despite an earlier pledge from Grand Met not to change its offer in the absence of a rival bid. The full panel on Tuesday ended a day of deliberation by backing the executive's decision and rejecting the Pernod appeal. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Pernod </PERSON> had said it would not be prepared to act as a `` white knight'' to save Irish Distillers from Grand Met. unless it was pledged the support of 50 percent of Irish Distillers shares. At the weekend it believed it had this support, holding pledges that included one from fruit and vegetable group <ORGANIZATION> FII </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fyffes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION> fruit and vegetable merchant, which holds 20 percent of Irish Distillers. But fears that <ORGANIZATION> Fyffes </ORGANIZATION> was about to change its mind and go for the higher English offer led <ORGANIZATION> Pernod </ORGANIZATION> to seek a temporary injunction from the <ORGANIZATION> Dublin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> preventing <ORGANIZATION> Fyffes </ORGANIZATION> from selling to Grand Met. A full hearing of the case will take place Wednesday. <PERSON> Pernod </PERSON> says it admits the Fyffes promise was not in writing, but believes it to be legally enforceable. Irish Distillers products include Irish whiskey brands <ORGANIZATION> Jamesons </ORGANIZATION>, Powers, <PERSON> Paddy </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Tullamore </LOCATION>.
