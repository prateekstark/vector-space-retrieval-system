 The week in music here has been busy. The Mostly Mozart Festival kicked off in <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, to run until Aug. 26. <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> inaugurated a large, new outdoor concert series on a <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> pier. And among the top musical delights was Friday night's recreation of a May 2, 1912, Clef Club Concert when <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Reese </PERSON> <PERSON> Europe </PERSON> brought 125 black singers and instrumentalists to Carnegie Hall. They performed music mostly by black composers, mostly high-quality, high-spirited light classical, no spirituals. It was a first for an American stage. High points of the evening included <PERSON> Jester </PERSON> <PERSON> Hairston </PERSON>, born in 1901, vigorously conducting `` Swing Along for Choir and Orchestra'' and `` Rain Song for Choir and Orchestra,'' both by <PERSON> Will </PERSON> <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> <PERSON> Cook </PERSON>. `` Swing Along'' got so much applause in 1912 it was performed again. The same thing happened on Friday. Another high point was two numbers by the Versatile Entertainers Quartet: piano, two banjos and snare drum. Conductor <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> Peress </PERSON>, who organized the program, could n't find the quartet's music from the 1912 concert. He knew they were post-ragtime and pre-jazz but did n't know what they sounded like. But he turned up a 1916 recording and the quick-tempo `` Winter Nights'' and `` Down Home Rag'' on it were recreated Friday, starting with a delightfully trembling piano by <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Owens </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Male </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Choir </ORGANIZATION> and Boys Choir of <LOCATION> Harlem </LOCATION> sang <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s `` Clef Club March,'' `` Benedictus from the Mass in G'' by <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Bolin </PERSON> and <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Coleridge </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>'s `` By the Waters of Babylon.'' The diva engaged to sing `` <LOCATION> Swanee </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>'' in 1912 substituted `` My Heart at Thy Sweet Voice'' from the opera `` <PERSON> Samson </PERSON> and Delilah'' and <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON> did the same on Friday. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Warfield </PERSON> sang <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosamond </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s folk-sounding `` L'il Gal'' and he and Miss <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON> had fun dueting `` Play that Barber Shop Chord.'' <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Bates </PERSON> played a piano solo with flourishes, `` Dance Heroique.'' At a pre-concert lecture, Dr. <PERSON> Reid </PERSON> <PERSON> Badger </PERSON> talked about <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, who formed the <ORGANIZATION> Clef </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> as a booking agency for black musicians. He maintained a Clef Club Orchestra, with mandolins and banjos instead of second violins, for a strumming accompaniment, really the beginning of orchestral jazz. <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and his musicians often accompanied dancers <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Irene </PERSON> <PERSON> Castle </PERSON>. The last piece on the program was a waltz he composed for them. <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> wrote for Broadway and in the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> in World War I, he organized a brass band. He is n't better known, <PERSON> Badger </PERSON> said, because he died at 38, stabbed by a deranged musician during a concert in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Fish Escapes After Marathon Battle</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SOLDOTNA, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Ploeger </PERSON> will have a well-documented fish story to tell when he gets back home to <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>. As with most fish stories, it will be about the one that got away. But this one is on the record. <PERSON> Ploeger </PERSON> attracted the attention of local news photographers and hundreds of onlookers as he battled a king salmon for nearly a day and a half before losing the fish and perhaps a world record. The length of the struggle coupled with the way the fish dragged boats up, down and across the river prompted speculation that it might have been the king of kings, the sport-caught salmon that finally would top the 100-pound mark. Kings that big have been caught commercially in <LOCATION> Cook </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Inlet </LOCATION> near the mouth of the Kenai, but the biggest ever taken on a rod and reel was 97 pounds, 4 ounces. The struggle began just after noon Wednesday when the 63-year-old <PERSON> Ploeger </PERSON>, a retired jailer from <LOCATION> Sandstone </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, hooked the fish about four miles upstream from the <LOCATION> Soldotna </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION> in south-central <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> about 75 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ploeger </PERSON> was fishing from a drift boat with a rookie guide, <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON>. <PERSON> Ploeger </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON> soon abandoned the drift boat, hopping aboard a passing powerboat after <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON> was unable to maneuver adequately through some boulder-studded rapids. He fought the fish that quickly was dubbed the `` Boss Hog'' through the night and all day Thursday. As word of the fish spread, the crowds grew. Local restaurants and businesses offered food and drink to <PERSON> Ploeger </PERSON> and the people helping him. Other guides shuttled fuel to the boat. <PERSON> Ploeger </PERSON> said there were hours of boredom punctuated by heart-stopping runs when the fish decided to go somewhere else. At one point, they thought they had him. `` He started coming up,'' said <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>, another guide recruited along the way. `` We thought he was worn out, but he must have gotten scared by the net.'' By Thursday evening, the shoreline was lined with people. Some brought lawn chairs, others fished themselves. At 8:36 p.m. they erupted in cheers when it seemed a world record had been set for the longest battle with a sport fish. According to the Guiness Book of World Records, a fisherman took 32 -LCB- hours to land a 1,600-pound marlin in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ploeger </PERSON> had that beat _ if he could land the fish. But about four hours later, in the murky twilight that passes for night during <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> summers, the fish escaped _ leaving <PERSON> Ploeger </PERSON> and everyone else wondering how big it really was.

<TEXT>
 A top aide to former Housing Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> disputes <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>'s sworn claim that he had no direct role in deciding what projects the scandal-scarred agency funded. Former <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> Assistant Secretary for Housing <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON> <PERSON> McVay </PERSON> <PERSON> Wiseman </PERSON> also says <PERSON> Carla </PERSON> <PERSON> Hills </PERSON>, currently the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade representative, lobbied <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> to lift restrictions on a mortgage lender now under federal criminal investigation. Hills is scheduled to testify before the committee on Monday. <PERSON> Wiseman </PERSON> said in sworn testimony Friday that <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> personally called her and instructed her to approve more than $ 15 million in funding for a <LOCATION> Durham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, project sought by a former <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> law partner. <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> said: `` I want the project funded,'' <PERSON> Wiseman </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Operations </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on employment and housing, one of three congressional panels investigating mismanagement and fraud at the housing agency. The <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> approval brought more than $ 11.3 million in rent subsidies, a $ 2.3 million grant and more than $ 3 million in tax credits to developers who were seeking to turn a hosiery mill into an apartment complex, said Rep. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON>, D-Calif., chairman of the subcommittee <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> has testified he set up a three-person panel to make funding decisions for the moderate rehabilitation program, but said he maintained `` final authority'' over the decisions. `` I did not plan, however, to get into the decision-making process of the panel when there was no complaint to justify my doing so,'' he told the subcommittee in May. Efforts by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> to reach <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> for comment were unsuccessful. <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON> said he would seek to recall <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> to the subcommittee before the congressional recess Aug. 4. <PERSON> Wiseman </PERSON> said she told <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> she could not fund the project over the objections of career <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> employees who had been `` violently opposed'' to the project. The project was eventually approved by <PERSON> Wiseman </PERSON>'s successor, <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> Hale </PERSON>, who said she believed she was `` acting on the approval of my boss.'' <PERSON> Wiseman </PERSON> also testified that <ORGANIZATION> DRG </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Funding </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a private lender that was suspended from participating in a $ 5 billion program in which <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> insured large portions of mortgages, was allowed to get back into the program after lobbying from <PERSON> Hills </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> Secretary. DRG is now under <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> criminal investigation. <PERSON> Wiseman </PERSON> said DRG's ability to underwrite mortgages had been placed on hold during the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration because of infractions of department rules. The suspension remained despite a meeting with Hills in late 1984 or early 1985 to get the restrictions lifted. `` It was not a convincing argument,'' <PERSON> Wiseman </PERSON> said. But DRG's probation was lifted despite the concerns of staff members, she said. `` It was later brought to my attention that <PERSON> Hills </PERSON> had ... taken the case to Secretary <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>. I was informed by staff that there was a meeting,'' she said. Lawmakers expressed concern about the conflicting testimony regarding <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>. `` The factual noose seems to be tightening around <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>'s neck,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION> `` We were very careful about asking him if he had ever tried to influence any project and we have two people making it very clear that he wanted a particular project funded,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Shays </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Conn </LOCATION> Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> filed suit in <LOCATION> Forth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, on Friday seeking to recover more than $ 2.5 million a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> woman is accused of bilking from the agency and spending on real estate, cars and guns. The woman is one of 10 closing agents nationwide the agency believes defrauded <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> of about $ 10 million.

 A <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> executive accused of pumping money into the campaign of a former governor of <LOCATION> Guam </LOCATION> in exchange for a political favor pleaded guilty Friday to three counts of mail fraud. <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Abba </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON> entered the plea before <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON>, said <LOCATION> Guam </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney, <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>. In exchange for his guilty plea, 46 counts alleging bribery, conspiracy, wire and mail fraud, and violation of interstate racketeering statutes were dismissed. `` In dismissing the counts, the Guam issues were dissolved,'' <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> said. `` Other issues are on the table if another jurisdiction sees fit to follow through.'' Twelve of the counts were related directly to <LOCATION> Guam </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> territory since August, 1950, said <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>. The balance of the counts related to fraud involving use of the <ORGANIZATION> Commercial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Americas </ORGANIZATION> in transactions that did not involve <LOCATION> Guam </LOCATION>, <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> said. Although <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON>, executive vice president of the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> bond underwriting firm of <ORGANIZATION> Matthews </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, only pleaded to three of the dozen counts, <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> was satisfied with the outcome. `` Mr. <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON>'s plea gave the same latitude of sentencing than if he went to trial,'' <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> said. `` We, of course, will recommend jail time and a heavy fine.'' <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON> faces a possible 15 years imprisonment, a $ 750,000 fine and restitution payments, <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> said in a telephone interview from his <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ana </LOCATION> office. Sentencing was scheduled in <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON>' court Sept. 11. One of <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON>'s attorneys, <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Weitzman </PERSON>, said he had no immediate comment.

<HEAD>Archbishop Calls for Blacks to Lead Church ``From Within''</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The leader of the nation's 300 Roman Catholic bishops admits there are persistent `` elements of racism'' in the church, but is calling for a black priest's breakaway congregation to return for the sake of unity. Archbishop <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> May </PERSON> of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bishops </ORGANIZATION>, promised the Rev. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stallings </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> the nation's two million black Catholics would be given `` full voice'' in the church. `` It is possible to ... be a voice of conscience for the family and lead that family from within,'' May said in a statement Friday. <PERSON> Stallings </PERSON>, 41, has been suspended for holding services the past two weeks at his <ORGANIZATION> Imani </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> in defiance of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Cardinal <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Hickey </PERSON>. A spokesman for <PERSON> Stallings </PERSON> said he would have no comment on May's statement or another call for unity from the nation's 13 black bishops earlier this week <PERSON> Stallings </PERSON> has said he formed the new congregation because the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> has not addressed black concerns and he has charged the church with racism. May's statement conceded, `` Surely, as all the bishops in this country have acknowledged in the past, there have been elements of racism in the church and there continue to be. `` We need to recognize more black leadership; our liturgies need more of the vibrancy, and our policies more of the insight, of African Americans,'' May said. He said the nation's 52 million Roman Catholics `` share the sadness'' reflected in the black bishops' call Wednesday for reconciliation. The black bishops' statement said in part, `` We sincerely hope -LRB- <PERSON> Stallings </PERSON>' followers -RRB- are not commingling personal disappointment, individually felt frustrations, and personal anger under the banner of racism. Racism is a sin which the church must address. It is too serious an issue to be used as a cover for selfish concerns.'' Several priests have supported <PERSON> Stallings </PERSON>, however, including 15 who met with him in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> Thursday. They called for <PERSON> Hickey </PERSON> to lift <PERSON> Stallings </PERSON>' suspension, imposed after the first service of the renegade church at <ORGANIZATION> Howard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> on July 2. Appearing Friday on The <PERSON> Oprah </PERSON> <PERSON> Winfrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Show </PERSON>, <PERSON> Stallings </PERSON> denied he is forming the church for personal gain. `` I know exactly the picture they're trying to paint ... but <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> <PERSON> X </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, people say they all have inflated egos,'' <PERSON> Stallings </PERSON> said on the national television program. He affirmed his plans to continue services despite the suspension, and said he `` can not be excommunicated from <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Christ </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Stallings </PERSON> said <PERSON> Hickey </PERSON> should `` eat crow,'' and `` admit he's wrong. `` Since the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> can not make inroads into the black community, all we are saying is, let us show you how. What's wrong with that? he asked. Suspension means <PERSON> Stallings </PERSON> is not sanctioned to say Mass or perform other sacraments. It is the strongest step <PERSON> Hickey </PERSON> can take without moving to excommunicate <PERSON> Stallings </PERSON>.

 Officials are investigating the pilot who survived an 800-mile flight, bullet wound and crash-landing in the ocean, expanding probes that began when three dozen guns and a can of ether were found in <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Root </PERSON>'s private plane. The reports that the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> communications lawyer is under investigation by several agencies added a peculiar twist to the tale of Root's rescue from the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> after apparently crashing unconscious into the water. Officials at agencies said Root is being investigated by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> over the weapons and ether, the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> Secretary of <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>'s Office concerning possible securities violations, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>, which investigates crimes aboard aircraft. Widespread publicity over Root's unlikely survival prompted Customs to expand its investigation Friday into <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>. `` This is weird to say the least,'' said a Customs official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. In addition, a review of documents at the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> showed Root repeatedly failed to comply with deadlines and other requirements in cases before the commission. Root also represented numerous clients of a Georgia-based company that another broadcast firm labeled a `` notorious application mill'' for FM broadcast licenses that allegedly has bilked hundreds of individuals of their investments. The 35 guns, many loaded, were found during a search April 24 by federal and local officials of Root's <ORGANIZATION> Cessna </ORGANIZATION> 210 at the <LOCATION> Manassas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, airport, said the Customs official. All the guns were legal under federal law, and all but one _ a machine gun Root had registered with the <ORGANIZATION> federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alcohol </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Firearms </ORGANIZATION> but not with <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> authorities _ were legal under state law. The state has filed a misdemeanor charge against him over the machine gun, the official said. Among the guns, including assault-style weapons and three .357 - caliber Magnums, the officials found silencers, ammunition clips, handcuffs, an electrical stun gun and a five-gallon can of ether _ which is used in cocaine production _ in the plane, the Customs official During a May 31 interview with Root by Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> County </PERSON> <PERSON> Polie </PERSON> and a Customs agent, `` by and large he was able to account for legal possession of those weapons.'' `` Basically, he indicated that he was a gun collector,'' the official said. But Root did not explain why he kept the weapons on his plane _ registered to a Washington-based company he owns _ nor why they were loaded. Root told officials the ether `` was used to clean his aircraft. But of course that's not what you use to clean an aircraft with unless you're going to blow it up,'' the official said. Customs kept the case open `` because when you come across this many weapons ... we always continue to take a look to make sure no Customs laws have been violated,'' he said. The search had been prompted by an unidentified source who said `` there was a suspicious aircraft at <ORGANIZATION> Manassas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airfield </ORGANIZATION>,'' the Customs official said. <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, Police Chief <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Witt </PERSON> revealed Friday that Root had been shot. The bullet traveled through his left rib cage and his colon, left his body, and then pierced his arm. A powder burn indicated Root was shot at close range, the chief said. In <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, Secretary of State <PERSON> Rufus </PERSON> <PERSON> Edmisten </PERSON> said his office had spoken with Root about a securities investigation involving Georgia-based <ORGANIZATION> Sonrise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> and that the lawyer `` knew he was under investigation.'' Sonrise said in a statement that the only connection between the company and Root `` is that he represents certain entities which also number among our clientele.'' <PERSON> Edmisten </PERSON> said <PERSON> Root </PERSON> was the attorney for investment partnerships formed by Sonrise to obtain <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> licenses. Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Rachel </PERSON> <PERSON> Halterman </PERSON> said investigators `` have not come to any conclusions and have not ruled out anything at all'' about what caused the events on the plane Thursday.

 An organization investigated by the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> during its protests of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policies in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> says a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> report criticizing the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> probe did n't go far enough. <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON>, political director of the <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> in Solidarity with the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Salvador </ORGANIZATION>, praised the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> for calling the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> surveillance of his organization unjustified and telling the agency to purge its files of the case. But `` we take strong issue with its conclusion that the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> investigation was an aberration and that it was n't politically motivated,'' <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON> said Friday after the <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> issued a report criticizing the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s investigation of <ORGANIZATION> CISPES </ORGANIZATION> between 1983 and 1985. The report sharply criticized <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> management for letting the investigation continue and said the probe was based on `` allegations that should not have been considered credible.'' `` The <ORGANIZATION> CISPES </ORGANIZATION> files contain information about domestic political activities that the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> should never have gathered,'' said Sen. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Boren </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Okla </LOCATION>., <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> chairman, and Sen. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Maine </LOCATION>, vice chairman `` That information must be removed from <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> records so it can not be used to damage the reputation of innocent persons,'' they said. But the report called the investigation an `` aberration'' and said it did not reflect `` significant <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> political or ideological bias,'' a point noted by both <ORGANIZATION> CISPES </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>. `` We do n't believe that an investigation that involved 59 field officers and 178 spinoff investigations that resulted in retrievable information being held in <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> files about approximately 2,375 individuals and 1,330 groups can be called an aberration,'' said <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON>. `` We believe the investigation was politically motivated from the start,'' said <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> said Director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sessions </PERSON> is still reviewing the report but issued a statement saying it was `` significant'' that the report found `` the <ORGANIZATION> CISPES </ORGANIZATION> investigation was not politically motivated to harass or influence legitimate First Amendment activities.'' An <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said the files would not be immediately purged because there is continuing litigation over the investigation. The Committee in Solidarity with the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Salvador </ORGANIZATION> was formed in 1980 because of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration aid to <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, which has totaled $ 3 billion since 1981. A 1983 <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> memorandum is quoted in the report as attacking <ORGANIZATION> CISPES </ORGANIZATION> for its protests and its practice of hosting Salvadoran refugees who said their lives had been threatened by death squads in their homelands. `` It is imperative at this time to formulate some plan of attack against <ORGANIZATION> CISPES </ORGANIZATION> and specifically against individuals ... who defiantly display their contempt for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government by making speeches and propagandizing their cause while asking for political asylum,'' the memo said. The report said, `` There may not have been tangible harm intended or done to any groups or individuals involved in constitutionally protected activity, but unjustified investigations of political expression and dissent can have a debilitating effect upon our political system.'' Despite such comments, the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Constitutional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION>, which filed a lawsuit on behalf of <ORGANIZATION> CISPES </ORGANIZATION>, said `` critical and unresolved issues relating to the monitoring of First Amendment-protected activities of domestic groups that oppose <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy'' remain. The probe was done while <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Webster </PERSON>, now director of the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>, was head of the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>. Sessions has taken several internal measures over the probe, including disciplining six employees at the supervisor, unit chief and section chief levels.

<HEAD>New Oil Spill Rules Could Mean Exxon Pays More</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM AHERN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A federal court ruling could make oil companies pay more to clean up oil spills, including the massive spill from an Exxon tanker that polluted the coastline of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, says a congressman involved in the fight over liability for environmental accidents. A three-judge panel of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> for the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> unanimously ruled Friday the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> should rewrite its rules on paying for oil spills to include the costs of more than just the monetary value of animals killed. The decision raises chances `` that companies will have to pay the whole cost of restoring an environment,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Torricelli </PERSON>, D-N.J. <PERSON> Torricelli </PERSON> said the case could have a major impact on damage payments by oil companies involved in spills, such as the March 24 accident that occurred when the tanker <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valdez </ORGANIZATION> dumped 11 million gallons of crude oil into <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s pristine Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON>. `` This will make <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>'s exposure much greater,'' said <PERSON> Torricelli </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Levitt </PERSON> said the agency had n't studied the ruling and would n't have any comment He said no decision had been made on whether to appeal the case. The regulations were issued three years ago to implement the 1977 Clean Water Act and the 1980 Superfund law, which required the government to write regulations determining the monetary costs of oil spills. Several environmental groups and states sued over the regulations. Under the 1986 regulations, the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> created a computer model putting a dollar value for `` lost use'' of various types of wildlife. For example, the cost of a fur seal was set at $ 15, based on the expected value of a seal pelt. The cost of geese ranged up to $ 35, based on their popularity among hunters. But the appeals court said <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, in writing the laws, had intended that repayment should be more broadly drawn to consider not simply the value of lost wildlife, but the larger cost of restoring the damaged environment. `` Because in some _ probably a majority _ of cases, lost-use value will be lower than the cost of restoration, <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION>'s rule will result in damages awards too small to pay for the costs or restoration,'' the ruling said. The <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has not yet decided on a damage assessment for either the Alaskan spill or three smaller spills which occurred last month off the coasts of <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 Coal miners in at least three states agreed to return to work this weekend, complying with the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> union in its bid to end a monthlong wildcat strike. About 15,250 miners in <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> decided to return to work beginning with shifts at midnight Friday and continuing through the weekend, <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> officials said. `` There may be a light at the end of the tunnel,'' said <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> 11 international executive board member <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Myers </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>. `` We're just pleased that the miners have chosen to return to their jobs,'' said <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Feeney </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> AMAX </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. But miners in <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> said Friday they would stay off their jobs. The situation of miners in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> was unclear. Wildcat strikes in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> ended last month. <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Trumka </PERSON> on Friday ended a five-day `` memorial period,'' a contract-sanctioned work stoppage that had affected 60,000 union miners east of the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. He also asked 37,000 wildcat strikers _ included among those participating in the memorial period _ to go back to work on their next scheduled shifts. The <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> international executive board meets July 26, and <PERSON> Trumka </PERSON> asked the miners involved in the wildcat strikes to return to work at least until then. The wildcat walkouts began June 12 in support of the <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION>'s strike against <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. That strike, idling 1,900 <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> members in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, began April 5 and showed no signs of ending Also Friday, a federal judge in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> said he wanted to talk with <PERSON> Trumka </PERSON> and <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON>, head of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, parent company of <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Trumka </PERSON> accepted; <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> gave no word. Only a small group of miners were scheduled to work today, and under the union's contract, no work is permitted at underground mines on Sundays. `` I anticipate a major return starting Sunday night and Monday,'' said <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Corcoran </PERSON>. <PERSON> Trumka </PERSON> called the memorial period last week in an attempt to calm the coal fields, where non-union coal shipments have been met by shootings, rocks and `` jack rocks,'' nails specially welded to flatten tires. As <PERSON> Trumka </PERSON> called on the strikers to return to work, violence erupted again in the coal fields. Two company guards were shot and wounded at <ORGANIZATION> Hampden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> near <LOCATION> Gilbert </LOCATION>, and a bomb damaged a replacement miner's car at <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION>'s headquarters in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>. Coal company officials this week blasted <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> Gov <PERSON> Gaston </PERSON> <PERSON> Caperton </PERSON> and state police for letting the strikers get out of hand. <PERSON> Caperton </PERSON> and state police have defended their actions, saying the coal fields are under control. However, no arrests had been made in any of the incidents of violence that have marked the wildcat strikes, and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's office in <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> said Friday it will begin investigating such incidents. Tension was evident after the Hampden shootings. Hampden Coal President <PERSON> Sid </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> _ speaking with two handguns strapped to his body, and flanked by two men toting semi-automatic weapons _ decried the violence. But he said his employees will not be intimidated by the 150 miners camped out in front of his mine beside <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> 52. `` I'd hate to be in the first 50 guys who try to stop'' shipments out of the mine, he said. On the <LOCATION> Hampden </LOCATION> picket line, most union members refused to talk to reporters. An <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> reporter was escorted from the site by a miner who held an ax handle pressed against the reporter's head. `` If ya'll know what's good for you, you'll stay away,'' the miner said.

 <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooke </PERSON>, the owner of the <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Redskins </ORGANIZATION>, sold his cable television systems to six companies for about $ 1.6 billion, according to a report published today.

<HEAD>`Star Wars' Particle Beam Fired Into Space</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Pentagon is studying results of a `` Star Wars'' test that is considered a key step in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> research to deploy futuristic weapons that could shoot powerful beams at enemy missiles. <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials on Friday confirmed completion of the test, which involved firing a beam of electrically neutral atomic particles into space for the first time. The BEAR test _ which stands for the Beam Experiment Aboard Rocket _ is designed to test how an accelerator of neutral particles would work in space. The experiment, which has been planned for more than a year, was completed early Thursday morning at the White Sands Missile Range in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, said Army Maj. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connell </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Initiative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. Program scientists need to test whether neutral particle beams _ in this case, hydrogen atoms _ can be used to discriminate between real and mock Soviet warheads. The spokesman said it was `` presumptive'' to announce whether the test had been a success, since officials and scientists still need to study the results of the experiment over the weekend before releasing more information Monday. The experiment involved lifting into space _ just for a few minutes _ a neutral particle beam accelerator atop a small Aires rocket. Before the rocket returned to earth, the accelerator was to be turned on for collection of data on how it worked and how the beam moved. In June, a similar test was aborted when the rocket failed to ignite on command. The Star Wars program is a research effort aimed at developing lasers, beam accelerators and other futuristic weapons that could be used to automatically shoot down nuclear missiles fired at the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> or its allies. The Pentagon and <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> are spending $ 4 billion on such research this year.

 A senior <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> scientist says the possibility that the so-called `` greenhouse effect'' will cause global warming `` is too much of a risk to ignore.'' Assistant Secretary <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hess </PERSON>, who oversees science and education programs, said Friday he has named <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> as his special assistant for global change issues. `` There are climate experts who claim the 1988 drought was evidence that global warming has already begun,'' <PERSON> Hess </PERSON> said. `` A conclusive link has not been proven, but the threat of global warming from heat trapped by so-called greenhouse gases is too much of a risk to ignore.'' Those gases include carbon dioxide, chlorofluorocarbons, methane, nitrogen oxides and halons, <PERSON> Hess </PERSON> said in a statement.

 The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> is investigating allegations of contract fraud at an <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> plant that makes material for nuclear weapons, says a top <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official. The Fernald plant, where production was suspended earlier this week, also is the target of a special investigation by a DOE team assessing health and safety measures and other aspects of the plant's operation. `` Fernald's been at the top of our list for some time,'' said Deputy Energy Secretary <PERSON> Henson </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> on Friday. `` We're going in there to see what's wrong and what might need to be done to get into compliance.'' <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Boldt </PERSON> said from <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> that the investigation was triggered by an allegation of criminal wrongdoing in contracting. He provided no details. The Fernald complex, located about 18 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>, is a key contributor to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> nuclear weapons production. It processes uranium compounds, produces uranium billets for nuclear weapons production and makes uranium target elements for defense nuclear reactors.

<NOTE>US Making Progress on Compensation Concerning Iran Air Crash</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration will announce a compensation offer early next week for families of the non-Iranian victims on the <ORGANIZATION> Iran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> flight shot down by a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warship a year ago, officials say. All but 40 of the 290 people who died were Iranian. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has said it would pay compensation to all families, but the Iranian government has refused to provide details about its citizens who died. The 40 non-Iranians were Indians, Pakistanis, Koreans, Japanese and citizens of several Arab countries. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government has said it will not pay the Iranian government directly, and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has called that position `` not acceptable.'' In civil lawsuits arising from crash deaths in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, courts generally award compensation based on the lost earnings of a family member. Thus families of people who die early in lucrative careers usually win larger awards than families of retired people. It is not known whether such an approach would be followed in the government's compensation offer. The officials, who asked not to be identified, on Friday were unable to provide figures on the compensation package they expect but said a formal announcement was expected early next week.

 A gunshot wound suffered by <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Root </PERSON> is only one of the mysteries surrounding the attorney after he flew apparently unconscious 800 miles down the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>. Officials from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> hope to interview Root today about the flight and crash landing in Bahamian waters. But they also are curious about two probes involving his gun collection and conduct as an attorney. Root was in stable condition today at Memorial Hospital in <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>, north of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. He was under heavy sedation Friday. `` It's an odd story all right,'' said <PERSON> Root </PERSON>'s brother-in-law, <PERSON> Brett </PERSON> <PERSON> Geer </PERSON>, after visiting Root at the hospital. `` With this wound and him not being able to recollect how he got it, I'm sure there is reason for an investigation.'' Root had a .32 - caliber handgun with him in the cockpit, <PERSON> Geer </PERSON> Investigators from the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> need permission from Root's physicians to conduct the interview. `` There are many questions I'll be asking,'' said <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> investigator <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Alston </PERSON>. Developments Friday included: _ In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Customs official said authorities found 35 guns, many of them loaded, and a can of ether in a search of Root's plane last April at the <LOCATION> Manassas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> in All of the guns were legal under federal law, and all but one under state law, which led to a state misdemeanor charge. The arsenal included assault-style rifles and three .357 - caliber Magnum Root had told Customs officials that the ether, which can be used in cocaine production, was used to clean his aircraft. _ In <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, Secretary of State <PERSON> Rufus </PERSON> <PERSON> Edmisten </PERSON> said his office has been investigating security fraud allegations against a company with which Root acted as an attorney <PERSON> Edmisten </PERSON> said there are allegations that the company, <ORGANIZATION> Sonrise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, was set up in a way that allowed it to avoid securities laws. <PERSON> Edmisten </PERSON> said the lawyer knew he was under investigation. Root, 36, apparently became unconscious in his cockpit Friday with his plane on autopilot and military pilots shadowing his aircraft for nearly four hours. His plane ran out of gas and crashed in mile-deep waters 14 miles west of the <LOCATION> Bahamian </LOCATION> island of <LOCATION> Eleuthera </LOCATION>. Root swam to a raft, where rescuers pulled him to safety. <PERSON> Geer </PERSON> said <PERSON> Root </PERSON> told him the bullet wound was not self-inflicted and could have occurred when the impact of the crash triggered a .32 - caliber pistol carried on board the single-engine <ORGANIZATION> Hollywood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> Chief <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Witt </PERSON> noted that a powder burn on Root's skin indicated the shot was fired at close range. Investigators said there was no evidence that anybody else was in the plane. <PERSON> Witt </PERSON> said surgeons had found a wound to Root's abdomen, and determined that a bullet passed through his colon, exited, struck him in the left arm and exited again. Authorities have received `` multiple phone calls'' from people in several states making `` various allegations that have not been confirmed,'' said <PERSON> Alston </PERSON>. He declined to give details, but said they came from private citizens and government agencies on topics that included <PERSON> Root </PERSON>'s finances and his piloting ability Root's wife, <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON>, 35, was in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> but has refused to comment on the episode. <PERSON> Alston </PERSON> said he hoped to interview Root's relatives. Authorities earlier had speculated that the <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, communications lawyer may have had a heart attack or inhaled carbon monoxide, causing him to black out about two hours after leaving <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> National Airport. <PERSON> Alston </PERSON> said Root reported in radio transmissions that he was having difficulty breathing, and then radio contact ceased. Capt. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Rahman </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> surgeon who first treated Root in <LOCATION> Nassau </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION>, said he was shocked to learn a gunshot wound had been discovered by doctors at Memorial Hospital. <PERSON> Rahman </PERSON> said <PERSON> Root </PERSON> hestitated when asked to explain why he passed out. `` Looking back, now I see that he answered everything else promptly. I had to ask that question twice and he paused before answering, but I did n't think about it at the time,'' the doctor said.

<HEAD>Inside Jneid Prison, Palestinians Run Their Own State</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP Extra</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Behind the cement walls, barbed-wire fences and guard towers of Jneid prison, 850 tough Palestinian prisoners are running their own state. The prison, built on the barren hills near the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, is the largest for `` serious'' <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> guerrillas, those serving 20 years or more for attacks on Israeli targets. Among the inmates, dozens are serving life sentences, <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> said. The report Friday by the state television, the first time TV had been allowed to film inside the prison walls, showed something that looked more like a miniature state than a jail. The 850 inmates are kept in small, often crowded cells, each occupied by an average of 14 people. Jneid prison costs <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> more than $ 7.5 million a year. Unlike other prisons, there are reportedly no sexual assaults and no drugs in this one, practically run by a committee of six elected leaders. `` We have a committee of six prisoners who belong to different <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> factions. Each group has its own internal laws of selecting its representatives,'' said the prisoners' spokesman, <PERSON> Abdel </PERSON> <PERSON> Khader </PERSON> <PERSON> Fares </PERSON>. The committee was shown discussing prisoners' demands with warden <PERSON> Muffid </PERSON> <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON>, a Druse officer, and writing down a protocol of the talks. `` The prisoners are trying to expand all the time what they see as mini-autonomy. They demand improvements in all the fields: new teeth, union rights ... free passage from one prison section to another and a private doctor,'' the television said. <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON> said he usually responds positively to prisoners requests `` if it does not harm the security of the prison and if it is a human matter the prisoners need. They know it and they appreciate it.'' But Fares, serving a 15-year sentence for planting a bomb and a firearm attack on an Israeli bus, had a different opinion. He said inmates can pressure the authorities because of their influence on the <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> revolt that has raged for 19 months outside Jneid walls. `` They feel we are a honorable part of the Palestinian people in the -LRB- occupied -RRB- territories and we can influence the situation,'' he said. The prisoners refuse to work for the benefit of their Israeli enemies. But the discipline imposed by their leadership is tight and they clean their rooms, run the kitchen and have a tailor and a barber. The prison library has 4,000 books and the prisoners use it to conduct lessons in Hebrew, English, French, philosophy and Marxism, the television said. The prisoners also are allowed to spend 2 -LCB- hours in the prison courtyards. During one such break, prisoners were shown purposefully playing table tennis, basketball and chess or jogging around the courtyard. `` The terrorists view the prison as an academy for revolutionary education and for the creation of commanders,'' the television said. `` Every minute is reserved for useful conversations, studies, for strengthening the body and the spirit.'' <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> <PERSON> Shoshan </PERSON>, an officer of the prison administration, said the prisoners `` have their own doctrine. They have a specific way of life: sport activities, reading, education. They want to leave the prison more educated.'' Fares said the prisoners view their miniature Jneid state as a step bringing the Palestinians closer to their goal of independence. `` We are inside prisons, but everybody knows we are part of the Palestinian people, part of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said. During family visits, held in a large hall separated by wire mesh, the prisoners' conversations are not monitored and it showed the inmates passing written notes described as `` instructions and reports,'' the television said. `` This is the heart of the prison, a link to the territories,'' the television said. `` And if you ask the prisoners, the uprising started here, in security prisons.''

<TEXT>
 The question of whether Brig. Gen. S.L.A. <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> fabricated data in his book about <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soldiers under fire is central to a debate raging between his critics and his grandson. In the renowned historian's 1947 `` Men Against Fire,'' <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> stated that as few as 15 percent of American infantry soldiers in World War II fired their weapons, for a variety of factors including paralyzing fear. The `` firing ratio'' finding led historians to change their emphasis in studying combat from the perspective of the commander to that of the common soldier, and helped prompt the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military to modify infantry training for the Korean and <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> wars. `` We think in a new way about combat because of <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Fredric </PERSON> <PERSON> Smoler </PERSON>, a historian at <ORGANIZATION> Sarah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lawrence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bronxville </LOCATION>, N.Y. But <PERSON> Smoler </PERSON> wrote in the March issue of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> magazine that <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>'s findings were merely a theory he had derived from anecdotal evidence, and not based on the authoritative study that <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> claimed. <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>'s thesis may have been based on evidence he `` made up,'' <PERSON> Smoler </PERSON> wrote. <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>'s grandson, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>, entered the fray late in May with a three-part series in the <ORGANIZATION> Seattle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post-Intelligencer </ORGANIZATION> that defended his ancestor's thesis and questioned the research of his detractors. <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>, a reporter for the newspaper, spent four weeks interviewing his grandfather's colleagues and searching archives. The younger <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> fell out with his grandfather during the Vietnam War when he was given an honorable discharge from the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> as a conscientious objector. In an interview last week, he said he conducted the investigation of his grandfather's work `` as a reporter, not a defender.'' `` American Heritage raised questions of methodology but they have n't refuted his basic thesis. The bigger issue is, was he right or was he wrong?'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> said. S.L.A. <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>, who died in 1977, wrote 30 books over his career as a reporter for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> and as military historian. Among his works are `` <LOCATION> Pork </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chop </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>,'' about the Korean war battle, and the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> history of World War I. But his most important contribution was the `` firing ratio,'' which he said was based on 400 to 600 post-battle interviews with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soldiers in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> in World War II. <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Leinbaugh </PERSON>, a World War II infantry company commander and author, felt S.L.A. <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>'s work maligned American soldiers and conducted the research that initially questioned the basis of <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>'s hypothesis. The research by <PERSON> Leinbaugh </PERSON> and <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Spiller </PERSON>, a historian at the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s Command and <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Staff </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Leavenworth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION>, showed no statistical evidence existed to back up <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>'s claim that most soldiers did n't fire in battle, <PERSON> Smoler </PERSON> wrote. `` It all pivoted on the fact that -LRB- <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> -RRB- said he had the statistical evidence to back it up. ... We're saying he did n't have the numbers to back himself up,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Snow </PERSON>, managing editor of American Heritage. <PERSON> Spiller </PERSON> said he was doing research at the S.L.A. Marshall Military History Collection at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION> for a possible biography of <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> and found no evidence of the studies <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> said he conducted. `` I would have been satisfied with tickmarks on a page of rough notes ... but I did not find some indication that he had done what he said he had done,'' <PERSON> Spiller </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. <PERSON> Spiller </PERSON> also interviewed <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Westover </PERSON>, a retired <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> professor of history and <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>'s assistant during his World War II research, who said he did n't recall conversations with <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> on the subject. <PERSON> Westover </PERSON> said <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> `` did not have the statistical evidence'' a social scientist would require to back the thesis. `` The statistics are made up out of the whole cloth, but the truth is there,'' he said in a telephone interview. <PERSON> Spiller </PERSON> said he disagreed with <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> and <PERSON> Westover </PERSON> in accepting `` impressionistic evidence'' as the basis for the theory. `` That's like saying it may not be the truth but it ought to be,'' he said, adding, `` I use his books in class and will continue to do so, but in a different way.''

Thousands of Americans on Friday celebrated the French's bicentennial of Bastille Day It marked the July 14, 1789, storming of the Bastille prison in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, the start of the French Revolution. But the celebration in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, beginning Friday and lasting through the weekend, opened with a problem _ no <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> representatives. <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Paris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> said she could n't lure <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> officials to the northeast <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> town of 27,000 for the celebration, which includes a bike race called the Tour de <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> So when French residents <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Claud </PERSON> <PERSON> Savouret </PERSON>, 57, and <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Perraut </PERSON>, 38, arrived at the festivities, they became honored guests. `` They'll be our special ambassadors,'' <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON> said after meeting the two, who were visiting friends in the area. Said Perraut: `` I feel glad for us as Frenchmen to celebrate in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>.'' In <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, 115 waiters and waitresses carrying full bottles of champagne ran 11 blocks, opened the bubbly and served it with style to a panel of judges. They were after a free trip to <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>.

Cast members from the Broadway musicals `` Les Miserables'' and `` Phantom of the Opera'' attended a Bastille Day luncheon to benefit a soup kitchen. There was one Bastille Day controversy in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, though: An <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> artist harboring a 13-year grudge burned a <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> flag in front of the French Consulate. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lance </PERSON> <PERSON> Corey </PERSON> said he was protesting treatment of artists at an exhibit in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> held in December 1975 and January 1976. And in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Surrealist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> passed out leaflets denouncing the anniversary events as `` a trivialization of an important landmark of human freedom.'' One French-owned hotel in a <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> suburb featured a giant guillotine made of cream puffs and a sugar model of the Bastille at its bicentennial celebration. In <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, three French climbers on Friday ascended the <LOCATION> Grand </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Teton </LOCATION>, the three peaks that cap the <LOCATION> Teton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Range </LOCATION>. Mountain guide <PERSON> Art </PERSON> <PERSON> Peters </PERSON> said the Bastille Day climb was a joint project with three Americans climbing in <LOCATION> Chamonix </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Blanc </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Peters </PERSON> said the Tetons were first discovered by French fur trappers in the early 1800s who named them `` Les Troix Tetons,'' meaning the three breasts. Farther west, at <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> racetrack in <LOCATION> Inglewood </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, organizers of a bicentennial celebration on Sunday continued to build a 50-foot-high layer cake. The cake, which was to be attached to a frame today, was to include two models of <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>' Arc de Triomphe stacked atop one another, with a version of the Eiffel Tower across the arcs. `` I think it's the largest cake you can build without a foundation system,'' said architect <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, one of its designers. Originally, the cake was planned for 100 feet, but that would have required a building permit.

<HEAD>UFO Watchers, Other Fringe Politicians Take to The Airwaves</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A political party that wants better relations with other planets and a wrestler who believes sports is the key to world peace have captured the fancy of voters wearied by the scandals of mainstream politicians. Half the seats in the upper house of parliament are at stake this month, and the dominant political party is working overtime trying to clean up its image and raise its approval ratings by promising reforms. Meanwhile, a variety of fringe parties are taking advantage of the disenchantment with the governing <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and the law that liberally allocates the airwaves to political campaigns. Under the <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION>, any party producing 10 members who pay $ 29,000 each as `` guarantee money'' can claim at least 14 minutes on the <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> channel and additional radio time, reaching a potential audience of 122 million. The UFO Party, offering nine candidates, has qualified for four free television appearances and two radio broadcasts. So has the <ORGANIZATION> Sports </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Slash-the-Number-of-Parliamentarians </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Miscellaneous </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which advocates gay rights, earned two television appearances and one radio broadcast. About 34 of the so-called mini-parties are supporting candidates in the July 23 elections for 126 seats in the upper house. Although most candidates read their speeches on a staid blue-and-gray set with a dull monotone and a deadpan look, some have mastered the medium of television. <PERSON> Haruzo </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanawa </PERSON>, 73-year-old head of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> for the Extermination of AIDs and Sexual Disease, sang a self-composed ditty. His song called for legalizing prostitution, and he exhorted young people to develop sexual morality. Towering former wrestler <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Inoki </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Sports </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> told voters: `` Violence is n't necessary, but a leader should have a certain kind of energy.'' <PERSON> Inoki </PERSON>'s platform stresses the achievement of world peace through international sports exchanges. The ex-grappler is perhaps best known outside <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> for his widely ridiculed exhibition match 13 years ago with former boxing great <PERSON> Muhammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON>. The head of the <ORGANIZATION> Slash-the-Number-of-Parliamentarians </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Kikuo </PERSON> <PERSON> Suda </PERSON>, began his speech with, `` Do n't you think there are too many parliament members? If we did it the way they do in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, we would have only 50 members in the -LRB- 252-member -RRB- upper house.'' The UFO party has spent its air time calling for a comprehensive policy to deal with unidentified flying objects, announcing that the <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> ambassador told them Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> had a strong interest in the subject. The <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Youth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, an ultra-right group, was represented by <PERSON> Toyohisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Eto </PERSON>, who argued against <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s anti-war constitution and against opening <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s markets to farm exports. The Liberal Democrats, meanwhile, are struggling with the <ORGANIZATION> Recruit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> influence-peddling scandal that forced the resignation of former Prime Minister <PERSON> Norobu </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>. His successor, <PERSON> Sousuke </PERSON> <PERSON> Uno </PERSON>, has been fending off allegations about his relationship with a geisha and the fallout from a sales tax his party backed that has angered consumers. The Liberal Democrats, who have governed <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> for 34 years, are suffering unprecedented disapproval ratings.

 The fate of <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s hostile $ 12.2 billion bid for <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> rests with the <ORGANIZATION> Delaware </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> after a judge refused to block Time's $ 14 billion tender offer for <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION> The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> agreed late Friday to hear the case after <ORGANIZATION> Chancery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> turned down a request by <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> and some of <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION>'s biggest shareholders for an injunction against <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION>'s bid for <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> halted Time's $ 70 a share offer, which had been scheduled to expire at midnight Monday, for 10 days to give Paramount time to appeal his ruling. If Paramount loses, it will pave the way for Time and <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> to merge, forming <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the world's largest communications concern. Paramount, which is offering $ 200 a share for <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION>, has said it would not pursue a buyout of <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>. Time called <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>'s decision, `` a very big step toward making <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> a reality.'' <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> rejected <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION>'s contention that <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> directors put the company up for sale by agreeing to a friendly merger with <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> last March. `` There has never been the slightest subjective interest in selling to or submerging Time into another entity,'' <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> wrote in a 79-page decision. The judge agreed with Time's argument that the proposed merger with <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> was the culmination of two years of negotiations, and as such represented a long-term business decision. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> said he concluded the plaintiffs had n't shown a reasonable probability that they possessed the right to require Time's board to abandon or delay the <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> transaction. Time is offering to pay $ 70 a share in cash for half of <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>'s 200 million outstanding shares and later exchange $ 70 in cash and securities for each of the remaining shares Time stock fell $ 4.75 a share to $ 145.25 a share on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> after having dipped as low as $ 138 a share. <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> stock rose $ 2 a share to $ 64.25 and <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> slipped 12 -LCB- cents to $ 57.50 a share. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> heard arguments from both sides during a 5 -LCB- - hour hearing Tuesday Attorneys for <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> and the shareholders _ who included <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> investor <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bass </PERSON> _ claimed Time's directors violated their duty by refusing to let shareholders vote on <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION>'s bid and the tender offer for <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>. The attorneys said the Time and <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> boards knew they were opening the companies up to outside bids by deciding to merge and <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> must therefore seriously consider <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION>'s offer. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> agreed with the Time and <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> contention that <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION>'s directors did not violate their duty to shareholders Time and <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> announced their original stock-swap merger agreement March 4. The companies planned to submit the plan to shareholders, but amended the agreement in June _ after <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> made its original $ 175 a share bid _ to provide for <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 70 a share tender offer. A vote was required on the original agreement because it involved the issuing of more Time shares, but an acquisition did not require a vote, the lawyers argued. Time's board has rejected <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION>'s bid as financially inadequate and too conditional to be viable. Time also has accused Paramount of undertaking the bid solely to destroy the competitive advantage <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> would have over Paramount. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>'s decision and the final outcome of the case have been anxiously awaited by other companies that might be contemplating friendly mergers of their own. Many of the nation's largest companies are incorporated in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> _ like <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> _ and are subject to its laws. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> disagreed with a claim by <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> and the shareholders that <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> had put itself up for sale in their initial merger agreement on the grounds the current <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> shareholders would end up holding more than 60 percent of the stock in <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>.

<TEXT>
 A family whose bean farm on the edge of the <LOCATION> Everglades </LOCATION> was sold for nearly $ 23 million donated about a third of the cash to a high school scholarship fund. `` I ca n't think of anything more important than getting the kids an education. We just have to educate our kids properly,'' said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> during a brief ceremony Friday at which he presented the $ 6.4 million endowment to <ORGANIZATION> Deerfield </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beach </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. The school was singled out to receive a third of the income from the sale of the land in the wills of <PERSON> Butler </PERSON>'s aunt and uncle, <PERSON> James </PERSON> and <PERSON> Alice </PERSON> <PERSON> Butler </PERSON>, pioneer farmers who came to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> in 1910. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> died in 1965. Mrs. <PERSON> Butler </PERSON>, who died in 1976, believed the sale of the 400-acre farm would reap about $ 250,000. But rapid growth in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> has inflated land prices in the area about 12 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Coral </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION> acquired the property June 22 and plans to build home subdivisions. `` We knew the property was worth a lot more than <PERSON> Aunt </PERSON> <PERSON> Alice </PERSON> thought,'' said <PERSON> Butler </PERSON>, 72, who farmed the land until 1985. `` We just wanted to farm it, pay the bills and keep it free and clear from debt until the time was right.'' <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> said the 1,600-student school also will receive a third of some other farm assets still to be sold. School officials knew of the will's provisions for years, but were stunned by the amount of the gift. Principal <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Clodfelter </PERSON> said many students who might not have considered college could now do so with grants from the fund. He said the school will form a scholarship committee to oversee the funds and determine how they will be allocated. Under present rates, the yearly interest from the endowment would be more than $ 500,000, said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Moyar </PERSON>, a vice president at <ORGANIZATION> Southeast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, which is handling the funds. `` <PERSON> Alice </PERSON> and <PERSON> James </PERSON> wanted to do a lot for the high school,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON>, an attorney for the Butlers' estate. `` She was adamant about the school.''

<HEAD>South Korea Calls Off Sports Talks With North Korea</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government accused communist <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> today of trying to stir unrest in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and called off talks on fielding a joint team at the 1990 Asian Games in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. In a letter to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> canceled talks planned for Tuesday at the border truce village of <LOCATION> Panmunjom </LOCATION>. The letter accused <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> of slander and `` hostile political maneuvering'' aimed at causing civil unrest in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, but said <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> hoped talks would be resumed soon. The cancellation reflected the souring relations between the countries over a series of illegal visits by <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Koreans </LOCATION> to the north. Trips to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> without prior government approval are a crime in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. The government maintains that all contacts and dialogue with the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> must be made through official channels. The last sports meeting, the second in a series, was held in March, but <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> had refused to resume the talks until recently. The two Koreas have tried to improve relations through a series of talks that began in 1988, although little progress has been made, with each side insisting on its own initiatives. Contacts grew chillier earlier this year when <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> demanded that <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> cancel annual military exercises with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> since postponed other talks, including those on a long-planned meeting between lawmakers from both nations, and accused <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> of encouraging secret visits by <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Koreans </LOCATION> to stir up problems in the South. <PERSON> Moon </PERSON> <PERSON> Ik-hwan </PERSON>, a Presbyterian minister who made an unauthorized visit to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> in March to see North Korean leader <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Il </PERSON> <PERSON> Sung </PERSON>, has been jailed on charges of violating national security laws. A student defied the <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> government and attended an international youth festival, which ended last weekend in <LOCATION> Pyongyang </LOCATION>, triggering crackdowns on radical students in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. An opposition lawmaker was arrrested June 28 for making a secret trip to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> in August. Nine other people have been jailed for failing to report the lawmaker to authorities.

 The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> said the four people charged this week with developing rockets for the <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> represent the group's `` main cogs'' in efforts to build sophisticated new weapons. Agents arrested three of the suspected <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> technical experts Wednesday, and later seized radar and missile parts during raids in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> said Friday. An arrest warrant was issued for a fourth, who the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> believes has gone into hiding in <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. Investigators say the four were working for the Provisional <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>, the guerrilla wing of the nationalist group fighting to end British rule in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. The four face federal charges of conspiring to injure and destroy the property of a foreign government, which carries a penalty of up to three years in prison and a $ 5,000 fine. Among the items confiscated in raids Wednesday and Thursday on two apartments in <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, were 6-foot-long missile launching tubes and a videotape showing one of the suspects firing a rocket, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> said. A raid on a house in <LOCATION> Nashua </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.H. </LOCATION>, yielded technical documents on missiles and British helicopters, and a search of a house in <LOCATION> Harwich </LOCATION>, on <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cod </LOCATION>, turned up enough radar parts and electronic gear to fill a station wagon, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> said. `` It appears quite clear that they were doing a two-fold operation: building a radar deliverance system, and developing rocket technology aimed at something _ and the something appears at the very least to be British helicopters,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahearn </PERSON>, special agent in charge of the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> office at a news conference Friday. <PERSON> Ahearn </PERSON> said the ability to manufacture radar-guided missiles would have added significant firepower to the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>'s campaign against the British. Arrested were <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, 41, of <LOCATION> Nashua </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.H. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Quigley </PERSON>, 27, a citizen of the <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> who has been living since April in <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>; and <PERSON> Christina </PERSON> <PERSON> Leigh </PERSON> <PERSON> Reid </PERSON>, 25, of <LOCATION> Sunnyvale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>. The fourth suspect was identified as Irish citizen <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Eamonn </PERSON> <PERSON> Maguire </PERSON>. `` We do believe that the main cogs in the wheel, so to speak, have been identified,'' <PERSON> Ahearn </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Budd </PERSON>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney for <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, said a grand jury is expected to consider other charges against the four, including violations of the Arms Export Control Act and aiding a foreign insurrectionary group, both of which carry prison sentences of up to 10 years. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Quigley </PERSON> were being held by the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Marshal's Service in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, respectively. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> held a top secret security clearance as an electrical engineer for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mitre </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bedford </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ahearn </PERSON> said there was no evidence that anything <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> did at <LOCATION> Mitre </LOCATION> materially contributed to this case. <PERSON> Reid </PERSON> was released on $ 10,000 bail Thursday, and a hearing was set for Aug. 8 to move her case to <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Budd </PERSON> said he expects all three defendants to go on trial. <PERSON> Ahearn </PERSON> said the arrests resulted from an investigation that began in 1981 and is continuing. He said the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> decided to arrest the defendants on short notice Wednesday after they realized they were under surveillance. He refused to say how they found out.

<DATELINE>NAIROBI, Kenya (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The capital of <LOCATION> Somalia </LOCATION> was reported calm today, one day after state radio said 10 people were killed and 32 injured when security forces opened fire on locals who attacked them with stones, knives and sticks. The clash broke out Friday near a mosque in a neighborhood of western <LOCATION> Mogadishu </LOCATION>, according to Somali state radio. The casualties included `` troublemakers'' and members of the security forces, according to a state radio broadcast monitored in <LOCATION> Nairobi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Somalia </LOCATION>'s western neighbor. A resident contacted by telephone Friday said it appeared troops had opened fire as Moslem worshipers left their place of prayer. Islam is the state religion in the impoverished East African nation of about 9 million. The resident, who spoke on condition he not be identified further, said gunfire erupted around midday in the capital on the shores of the <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> and continued sporadically through the afternoon. Residents contacted by telex from <LOCATION> Nairobi </LOCATION> said life in <LOCATION> Mogadishu </LOCATION> appeared to have returned to normal today and that a 6 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew imposed Friday was lifted. A statement by the <ORGANIZATION> Somali </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, broadcast over state radio late Friday, said a group of `` troublemakers hiding behind the banner of religion'' caused the disturbances. Security forces tried to contain the situation peacefully, but opened fire after the `` troublemakers'' attacked them with stones, knives and sticks, according to the government statement. Ten people were killed and 32 wounded in the clash with casualties on both sides of the violence, said the statement. Friday is normally the Moslem Sabbath but July 14 also was the occasion for feast and celebration of the hajj, the Moslem faithfuls' pilgrimage to the holy city of <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION>. There were reports during the week that several Moslem religious leaders had been picked up by the authorities, but it was not known whether the alleged detentions had anything to do with Friday's violence Further information on the reported arrests was not available. Last Sunday, an unidentified gunman shot to death <PERSON> Mogadishu </PERSON>'s Roman Catholic Bishop <PERSON> Salvatore </PERSON> <PERSON> Pietro </PERSON> <PERSON> Colombo </PERSON> It also was not known whether the disturbances were connected to that incident. There are an estimated 2,000 Roman Catholics in <LOCATION> Somalia </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Somalia </LOCATION>, on the horn of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> that juts into the <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION>, has been led since 1969 by the autocratic President <PERSON> Mohamed </PERSON> <PERSON> Siad </PERSON> <PERSON> Barre </PERSON> as a one-party state. Since 1981, <LOCATION> Somalia </LOCATION> has battled the <ORGANIZATION> Somali </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>, a northern insurgency that demands <PERSON> Barre </PERSON>'s removal. Intensified fighting between the insurgents and the government over the last 18 months has driven more than 200,000 Somalis into refugee camps in neighboring <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Jury Says Dairy Wasn't to Blame for Jalisco Deadly Cheese Outbreak</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Jurors absolved a raw milk supplier from liability for nearly $ 100 million in unsettled claims from a 1985 listeriosis outbreak, in a decision that could limit compensation for some victims. The jurors Friday said that Alta-Dena Certified Dairy could not be held liable for a soft cheese produced with its milk. The cheese, made by <ORGANIZATION> Jalisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mexican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, was laden with the listeria bacteria. The bacteria killed 48 people and caused birth defects and other ailments in dozens more. `` I feel the lord has answered our prayers,'' said <PERSON> Alta-Dena </PERSON> founder <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Stueve </PERSON>, 71. `` We had nothing to do with this case in the first place.'' <LOCATION> Jalisco </LOCATION>, which has since gone out of business, had claimed that <PERSON> Alta-Dena </PERSON> sold it tainted milk. But <PERSON> Alta-Dena </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Novell </PERSON>, told the jury that bacteria was never found in the dairy's milk or herds, noting <PERSON> Alta-Dena </PERSON> supplied 26 million gallons of milk to 30 wholesale customers during the period in question and only <LOCATION> Jalisco </LOCATION> had an outbreak of listeriosis. `` This was strictly an issue between the two companies,'' <ORGANIZATION> Novell </ORGANIZATION> said after the 11-1 verdict. `` <LOCATION> Jalisco </LOCATION> looked around for deep pockets and sued us.'' Victims of the outbreak and their families wanted <PERSON> Alta-Dena </PERSON> to share responsibility. `` <LOCATION> Jalisco </LOCATION> had a small insurance policy to begin with _ about $ 10 million _ almost three-fourths of which has already been depleted in settlements of claims,'' said attorney <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, who represents claimants. `` A lot of the significantly injured plaintiffs will have to take small compensations,'' she said. `` There will not be enough funds to properly compensate these victims from <LOCATION> Jalisco </LOCATION> or its insurance proceeds.''

 <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON> <PERSON> Zemin </PERSON> called for more ideological education to shield young people from the influences of Western culture, official media reported today. <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON>, at a meeting Friday on higher education also attended by Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON>, said educators must take a clear stand against `` bourgeois liberalization'' in the wake of the student-led movement for democratic reform. Meanwhile, staff at the Jianguo Hotel and several other well-known <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> hotels said officials from the <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Import </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Export </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a state company, on Friday removed all foreign magazines and newspapers from their stands. Several other hotels, including the <ORGANIZATION> Sheraton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Great </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wall </ORGANIZATION>, the Holiday Inn and the Palace, also said foreign periodicals had been confiscated. The hotels said the Chinese officials gave no reason for confiscating the publications. Hotels are among the few places Chinese have access to foreign news accounts of the crackdown on dissent in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, which have differed greatly with the government's version. Satellite reception of TV news from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, including <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION>, were cut off at several hotels earlier this month. On Friday, the official press reported the government was planning a sweep on the nation's bookstores to removal publications written by scholars wanted by police for participating in the pro-democracy movement. The military crushed the movement in an attack on <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> on June 3-4 after the government declared it had become a `` counterrevolutionary rebellion'' against the socialist system. <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON>, the party's general secretary, said the rebellion backed up statements by senior leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON> that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s most serious fault in recent years was neglecting ideological education. `` Quite a number of young people have been greatly influenced by Western culture and ideology in recent years, yet we have slackened correct ideological education among them. As a result, they are not mentally prepared to face the hardships and complexities in the socialist construction and the reform,'' the official <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> quoted him as saying. University students already have been told they will have additional mandatory classes in ideology this fall. The <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> Daily reported this week that summer vacation programs have been arranged for primary and middle school students to educate them in loving the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, socialism, the motherland and the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. It said military officers will give lectures to children on the rebellion and children will visit martial law troops and the families of soldiers killed by protesters resisting their advance into the city. <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON> also gave backhanded praise to intellectuals, who had expressed support for the democratic movement. He said they were the `` gem of the nation'' but that `` intellectuals have their shortcomings and we should help them to have a better understanding through education and studies.'' He said dissident <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> <PERSON> Lizhi </PERSON>, who has sought refuge in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> and is wanted for purported counterrevolutionary crimes, `` and his like are scum of the Chinese intellectuals and very few in number.'' <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON> was appointed party chief on June 24 when the party purged <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON>, who had sympathized with some of the students' demands. <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON>, stripped of all his party posts, has not been seen since May 19. <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruihuan </PERSON>, a member of the powerful <ORGANIZATION> Politburo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, noted that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s two latest bouts of bourgeois liberalization, or flirtation with Western culture, began with student demonstrations. The government also launched a campaign against bourgeois liberalization after student demonstrations in the winter of 1986-87. `` This fact poses a problem for us and we should make a thorough study on how to run the schools well,'' he said. Also Friday, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> voted 81-10 to impose economic sanctions on <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and to urge President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to take even harsher measures. The legislation, passed as an amendment to a pending <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> appropriations bill, adopts several sanctions passed earlier by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>. It requires <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to suspend several trade programs but gives him the flexibility to stop any program suspension. The legislation includes six-month suspensions of trade insurance by the <ORGANIZATION> Overseas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Private </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and the use of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> funds to support <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> trade. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> also adopted non-binding suggestions in which they urged <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to take stiffer steps, including reviewing all trade agreements between the countries. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for a summit of the seven leading industrial nations, said the administration would consider the legislation but that the president's current response to the crackdown has been appropriate.

 A federal judge has agreed to hear the case of a teen-age <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> beauty queen who has filed a lawsuit to enter a national pageant under way in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Heather </PERSON> <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> McLeod </PERSON> sued the operators of the Miss Teen USA pageant in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bernardino </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, after she was disqualified for allegedly breaking the rules by competing in both <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Miss Teen contests the same year. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> said Friday he would review Ms. <PERSON> McLeod </PERSON>'s case Tuesday, one day before preliminary competition begins in the national Miss Teen USA contest, with $ 150,000 in prizes for the winner. <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Gee </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the national pageant, would n't say whether it's too late for Ms. <PERSON> McLeod </PERSON> to join the contest if a judge rules in her favor. Taping began Friday for the swimsuit competition portion of the test. The show's finale is July 25. Ms. <PERSON> McLeod </PERSON>'s attorney said the 18-year-old wants $ 200,000 in damages if she is barred from the contest, to make up for the `` extreme mental anxiety, public humiliation, personal embarrassment, public ridicule, and loss of reputation'' she will suffer. The attorney, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Zeh </PERSON>, unsuccessfully sought a temporary restraining order Thursday `` in hopes of getting a hearing and an order as quickly as possible to get her into the contest.'' `` <PERSON> Heather </PERSON> is here waiting ... time is of the essence,'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nevada-Reno </ORGANIZATION> psychology student, who attended high school in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>, was disqualifed from the national contest June 30 after winning the <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> pageant June 22 in <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>. She earlier had taken part in the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> state contest. <PERSON> Zeh </PERSON> contends Ms. <PERSON> McLeod </PERSON> was n't told she could be disqualified for competing in both <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> pageants and was n't given a copy of the rules. <PERSON> Stacey </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentley </PERSON>, 18, who finished second in the <ORGANIZATION> Miss </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nevada </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teen </ORGANIZATION> contest, has taken Ms. <PERSON> McLeod </PERSON>'s place in preliminary activities of the Miss Teen USA competition. As far as the Miss Teen USA officials are concerned, Ms. <PERSON> Gee </PERSON> said, `` <PERSON> Heather </PERSON> <PERSON> McLeod </PERSON> is not the Miss Nevada Teen delegate; the <ORGANIZATION> Miss </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nevada </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teen </ORGANIZATION> delegate is down here competing.''

<HEAD>Soviet Officials Report Losses from Spreading Coal Strikes</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Osiniki correct spelling</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Spreading strikes in the <LOCATION> Kuzbass </LOCATION> coal region of <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION> are causing heavy economic losses, newspapers reported today as officials appealed to miners in at least nine cities to return to work. Settlements were reported with miners in two cities, <LOCATION> Mezhdurechinsk </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Osiniki </LOCATION>, but strikes elsewhere have spread, the reports said. Soviet newspapers described a chaotic situation in the <LOCATION> Kuzbass </LOCATION>, an important coal-producing region about 1,600 miles east of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. It supplies fuel to the metallurgical industries in the <LOCATION> Ural </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> to the west. Thousands of miners and their families were said to be meeting in town squares throughout the coal-producing basin to protest harsh living and working conditions. Authorities reported an end to the strike Thursday, but miners expanded their demands from economic issues, such as food, housing and health care, to broader demands for political change, Soviet reports said. The crisis was sharpest in the town of <LOCATION> Prokopevsk </LOCATION>, where production was virtually halted, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Sotsialisticheskaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industriya </ORGANIZATION> reported in a dispatch from <LOCATION> Kemerov </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Oblast </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Kuzbass </LOCATION>. `` Events in the <LOCATION> Kuzbass </LOCATION> have taken a sharp turn,'' the newspaper reported. Although miners returned to work in <LOCATION> Mezhdurechensk </LOCATION>, in other mining towns in the basin `` the situation has sharply intensified.'' Mining Minister <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shchadov </PERSON> was in the area, rushing from mine to mine, `` spending many hours speaking to the strikers'' and trying to end the stoppage, the newspaper said. In addition to the agreement reached in <LOCATION> Mezhdurechensk </LOCATION>, where the strike began Tuesday, authorities also reached a settlement with miners in <LOCATION> Osiniki </LOCATION>, according to <PERSON> Sotsialisticheskaya </PERSON> <PERSON> Industriya </PERSON> and Pravda, another party newspaper. Strikes continued at <LOCATION> Prokopevsk </LOCATION>; at <LOCATION> Kisilevsk </LOCATION>, five out of 10 mines were on strike; two mines were on strike at Lenin-Kuznets; in <LOCATION> Kemerov </LOCATION>, the administrative center of the region, the Severnaya and Butovkskaya mines were on strike; miners were striking in <LOCATION> Novokuznetsk </LOCATION>, according to the newspaper reports. Miners in <LOCATION> Byelov </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Anzhero-Sudzhesk </PERSON> continued to work, but still made demands on authorities, the reports said. Reports said miners in nine cities were striking, although the published lists did not match. The reports said that despite a rather chaotic situation, rife with rumors, miners' strike committees that formed Friday were keeping social order. `` At their demand, sales of liquor were stopped and narcotics control points were established along highways,'' Pravda reported in a dispatch from its correspondent at the scene. It said that on Thursday in <LOCATION> Novokuznetsk </LOCATION> and on Friday in <LOCATION> Kemerov </LOCATION>, `` efforts were made by the so-called ` <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>' and several other informal organizations to spread anti-Soviet slogans, but they received a resolute rebuff.'' Authorities throughout the region tried to talk the miners back to work. `` Democracy means not only rights, but also responsbility, discipline and organization,'' <PERSON> Sotsialisticheskaya </PERSON> <PERSON> Industriya </PERSON> warned. Strikes were once hushed up and brutally suppressed in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, where they were considered a Western phenomenon resulting from capitalist exploitation. This year, however, coal strikes have generally ended after several days with government concessions. Last March, more than 100 coal miners in the <LOCATION> Ural </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Vorkuta </LOCATION> struck to protest increased work orders. In April, miners stayed underground in the Siberian city of <ORGANIZATION> Norilsk </ORGANIZATION> to demand a 30 percent wage increase. Twenty-four miners are reported to be staying underground in <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION> with demands similar to their <LOCATION> Kuzbass </LOCATION> counterparts.

<HEAD>CFTC Will Investigate CBOT Actions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>

 The <ORGANIZATION> Commodities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trading </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> says it will review the trading positions of <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> directors to see if any of them profited from the drop in soybean prices precipitated by their emergency order earlier this week. The <ORGANIZATION> CFTC </ORGANIZATION> made the announcement Friday as Italian agribusiness giant <ORGANIZATION> Ferruzzi </ORGANIZATION> said it would renew its court battle to recover losses from a <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> order forcing soybean traders to liquidate large positions in the market. <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardini </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Ferruzzi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finanzaria </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SpA </ORGANIZATION>, reiterated in <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION> that his company's accumulation of futures contracts to take delivery of 23 million bushels of soybeans was legal. A Feruzzi spokesman said a lawsuit probably would be filed in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, but did not provide a timetable. The company also indicated it might seek compensation for unrealized profits as well as damage to its reputation. On Thursday, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Zaghel </PERSON> denied a request by two of the company's subsidiaries _ <ORGANIZATION> Ferruzzi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trading </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SA </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Ferruzzi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> _ for a restraining order and a permanent injunction ending the directive issued Tuesday by the CBOT. <PERSON> Zagel </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> CBOT </ORGANIZATION> attorneys to file a motion to dismiss the lawsuit by Tuesday, with a response due July 24. <PERSON> Gardini </PERSON> did n't specify the amount of losses <ORGANIZATION> Ferruzzi </ORGANIZATION> suffered as a result of the board's order, which required all traders to reduce their July contract soybean holdings to 1 million bushels by the close of trading Thursday. <ORGANIZATION> CBOT </ORGANIZATION> directors have said they issued the liquidation order because the open July soybean contracts totaled about 40 million bushels and there were abnormally low levels of stocks available to satisfy the contracts _ a situation that would have resulted in a number of defaults without the exchange's intervention. Any player with a large enough share of the market _ a position referred to as `` cornering the market'' _ theoretically could force those on the other end of its futures contracts to deliver, possibly causing a scramble for supplies that would drive the price of its soybeans up sharply. Soybean prices for July delivery rose 6 cents to $ 7.03 -LCB- a bushel on Friday. Despite the gain, the price was still well below $ 7.26 a bushel, the level at which July soybeans settled on Tuesday before the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>'s directive. `` <ORGANIZATION> Ferruzzi </ORGANIZATION> and all major world traders are convinced that the board made a mistake and has to suffer the consequences,'' <PERSON> Gardini </PERSON> said about the potential lawsuit. <ORGANIZATION> Ferruzzi </ORGANIZATION> has said it accumulated large soybean supplies to keep its processing plants running and to meet export commitments, and also that its large futures market position was a hedge against price fluctuations. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> CFTC </ORGANIZATION> said it would review the trading positions of exchange directors and the minutes of the meeting at which the decision was made to force liquidation of soybean contracts. <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Karsten </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahlmann </PERSON> has said that none of those involved in the decision held a position in the soybean market when they voted to issue the emergency order. Meanwhile, Sen. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON>, D-Vt., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, expressed concern over the actions taken by the Board of Trade `` There have been serious allegations that there may have been an effort to manipulate the soybean futures market,'' he said `` I will insist on a full and rigorous investigation of any wrongdoing and that the perpetrators be punished to full extent of the law. `` If reforms are necessary to prevent these types of manipulations, I will insist on making them when this issue comes before my committee later this year.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> oversees the <ORGANIZATION> CFTC </ORGANIZATION>, which is up for reauthorization this year.

 Seven years after his sister's body was found along the <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, one of the first victims in the nation's worst serial murder case, <PERSON> Garrett </PERSON> <PERSON> Mills </PERSON> says he can only hope police have the killer Police began sorting through the 1,800 videotapes and 55 cartons and bags of materials seized from <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, a former law student named in court papers as a `` viable suspect'' in the slayings. The sorting could take a month. <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> has not been charged in the case and he denies any involvement. His name became public late this week in an affidavit supporting a search warrant for two <LOCATION> Spokane </LOCATION> homes used by him. The affidavit said he was under investigation in the case and might be linked to at least 17 other homicide victims whose bodies were found along highways between <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vancouver </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, and between <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Spokane </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mills </PERSON>' sister, 16-year-old <PERSON> Opal </PERSON> <PERSON> Charmaine </PERSON> <PERSON> Mills </PERSON> was one of the 40 known <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> victims. Police have blamed the killer for the disappearance of eight other young women. Ranging in age from 15 to 36, the female victims vanished between July 1982 and early 1984. Of the 40 corpses, 36 were found in the <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> area and four near <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>. Four remain unidentified The case takes its name from the site south of <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> where the first five corpses were found in the summer of 1982. `` I paid attention a lot at first, but I got tired of getting my hopes up,'' <PERSON> Mills </PERSON>, 25, said Friday of the investigation. He added, `` I hope it's him, but I do n't know.'' <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> is serving a one-year term in the county jail in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> for the burglary of a police equipment supply store in 1979 and additional time for walking away from a work-release center in 1981. He was rearrested in <LOCATION> Spokane </LOCATION> on Jan. 10. <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> was found after `` Manhunt,'' a nationally syndicated television show, aired a program in December about the <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> killings. One tipster directed investigators to <ORGANIZATION> Gonzaga </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Spokane </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> had attended classes for 3 -LCB- years and was president of the student bar. `` Whether or not this person is simply the victim of a bizarre set of circumstances or in fact responsible for some of the crimes in <LOCATION> King </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, we do n't know yet, and that's exactly what we're trying to determine by going through the material we recovered with the warrant,'' <ORGANIZATION> Green </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> River </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Commander <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> said Friday <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, who declined jailhouse interviews, `` is concerned he's being singled out as the answer to a longtime investigation,'' said his attorney, <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Beles </PERSON> `` He feels basically like anybody who is innocent of the offenses being looked at by the <ORGANIZATION> Green </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> River </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>. He is angry and frightened,'' said <PERSON> Beles </PERSON>. `` He's a colorful character, but he's no murderer.'' No personal items belonging to any <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> victims were found in Wednesday's searches, <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> acknowledged the <ORGANIZATION> King </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> task force had found `` no smoking gun,'' but he said an initial study of 405 documents charting <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>' movements between 1981 and 1989 showed they sometimes closely paralleled the killings. Records seized when he was arrested show he traveled extensively between <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Spokane </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vancouver </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, under at least four aliases during the period, <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> said. After his arrest, <LOCATION> Spokane </LOCATION> authorities found in searches that <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> possessed several police-type vehicles, 26 license plates, 29 firearms and about 100 police badges, investigators said. The task force has long suspected the killer could be a police officer or someone posing as one, <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> said. In the affidavit, many who knew <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> said he liked pornography, frequented prostitutes and carried photographs of mutilated women.

 Fire swept through a tent camp housing Moslems making the annual pilgrimage to <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION>, and five elderly Pakistanis were trampled to death in the ensuing panic, officials said today. Thirty-four others were hurt during the blaze that burned 220 tents Friday in the camp in <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION>, a civil defense official said in a statement distributed by the <ORGANIZATION> Saudi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. The camp was set up by the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Asian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilgrims </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, a Pakistani-based organization that arranges travel and accomodations for Moslems making the pilgrimage to the sacred Moslem city. The fire was caused by a flare from a gas cooker being used by one of the pilgrims, the statement said. The civil defense official said five elderly Pakistanis were trampled on as the pilgrims fled the camp. Fifteen of the injured remained hospitalized today and the others were treated and released. Such accidents are frequent during the pilgrimage season to <ORGANIZATION> Islam </ORGANIZATION>'s holiest shrines at <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Medina </PERSON>. About 2 million pilgrims from 80 countries gather for the rituals every year. The civil defense statement made it clear that authorities did not suspect sabotage at the camp. Two bombs exploded in <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION> on Monday at the height of the pilgrimage season. A Pakistani pilgrim was killed and 16 were wounded in the blasts.

 Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> took more heat for his 1990 budget cuts, which critics say could have been avoided had he acted swiftly to limit the state's financial troubles a year ago, during his presidential campaign. Demonstrators on Friday poured inside the <ORGANIZATION> Statehouse </ORGANIZATION> and marched to the doors of the governor's office chanting: `` No more cuts.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was not in, and they left peacefully about 20 minutes later. `` Let's send a message throughout the Commonwealth of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>,'' <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON> said at the demonstration. `` We are going to restore some semblance of decency and respect and compassion for people who need our help.'' Meanwhile, lawmakers vowed to restore $ 100 million in state aid to cities and towns that the governor vetoed to balance the fiscal 1990 budget. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> returned to the <ORGANIZATION> Statehouse </ORGANIZATION> later Friday to face other bad news: <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's dropped <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>' bond rating for the second time this year. The agency cited financial disarray in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> government. The move will add millions to borrowing costs. `` It's not unexpected. ... Had we demonstrated fiscal strength, we would n't have had to do what we did yesterday,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said of the budget cuts. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> defended his 1990 budget cuts as an `` essential part of getting the state back on track.'' The governor has come under fire for not acting swiftly when the state began to run into financial trouble a year ago. `` They've been whistling while <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> burned in this administration,'' said Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Flood </PERSON>, a Democrat who chairs the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Taxation </ORGANIZATION> committee. `` This is not a surprise to a lot of people,'' Flood said. `` It was avoidable and the administration chose to ignore the warnings.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> aides also announced the governor was postponing signing a bill legislators passed early Friday that would impose an income tax surcharge to make up the 1989 budget deficit and pay outstanding Medicaid debts. The measure is projected to raise $ 744 million over 18 months. `` He plans to sign it, assuming all the legal and technical questions are answered,'' said aide <PERSON> Mindy </PERSON> <PERSON> Lubber </PERSON>. Citizens for Limited Taxation and other anti-tax advocates say they'll take the income tax issue to the 1990 ballot to seek a refund.

<HEAD>Shiite Clashes, Syrian-Christian Duels Amid Power Blackout</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Rival Shiite Moslem militias clashed in the slums of south <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> today and Syrian and <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> forces fought artillery battles across the capital amid a power blackout caused by fuel shortages. Police said one person was killed and four were wounded in the four-hour clash between the mainstream <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> militia, which is backed by <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, and the pro-Iranian <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or Party of God. The two factions have clashed intermittently since April 1988 as they vied for dominance of 1.2 million Shiites, the largest single sect in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. By police count, the new casualties brought the overall toll of the power struggle to 561 killed and 1,554 wounded. Syrian troops deployed in west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> sent patrols at 4 a.m. into the low-income suburbs to disengage the militiamen and enforce a cease-fire between the secular Amal and the fundamentalist <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, a police spokesman said. The spokesman, who can not be named in line with regulations, said Syrian gunners in west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> sporadically shelled the coast from east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> to the port of <LOCATION> Byblos </LOCATION>, 28 miles to the north, maintaining their sea blockade of the Christian heartland. He said artillery fire fell around <LOCATION> Byblos </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Jounieh </LOCATION>, another port about 12 -LCB- miles north of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. No casualties were reported. Christian gunners of army commander Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> fired back with 155mm guns, targeting positions along west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s seaside districts. The police spokesman said at least one round exploded `` within a few yards'' of a Syrian artillery emplacement in a deserted soccer field in the fashionable <LOCATION> Manara </LOCATION> district. `` We do n't know if the Syrians suffered any casualties. They usually evacuate their casualties to their own field hospitals and clinics which are not under our jurisdiction,'' the police spokesman said. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s army command does not comment on losses among its 40,000 soldiers, stationed in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> under a 1976 Arab League peacekeeping mandate. The blockade of the Christian enclave has caused fuel oil shortages at <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s main power generating plant in suburban Zouk. The sea blockade has prevented shipments from arriving from abroad, and checkpoints around the enclave obstructed supplies from refineries in south and north <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The electricity authority announced that as of today its generators will supply only the main water pumping station in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and major hospitals and telecommunication switchboards with two hours of power every 24 hours on rotating basis. The public in both sectors of the divided capital and in the Christian heartland to the north will receive none. It was the second time that the city has plunged into total darkness since the confrontation between <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> and the Syrians began March 8. Last month's crisis was resolved after a partial lift of the land siege.

<TEXT>
 The bicentennial bash in honor of the French Revolution peaked with a parade that featured moonwalking Americans, Scottish bagpipers, Soviet tanks spewing confetti and a touching reminder of the crackdown in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. The three days of bicentennial celebrations were to close tonight at the Eiffel Tower with what was billed as the biggest ever fireworks display. The most offbeat event was the parade Friday night that featured a moonwalking <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> A & amp; M University marching band, British firefighters spraying spectators with water and a <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> bear skating pirouttes on ice. Perhaps the most poignant moment came early in the parade as hundreds of <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> students _ from <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> _ rode bicycles and flashed peace signs from the Arc de Triomphe to the Place de la Concorde. They wore headbands bearing the Chinese characters signifying `` Liberty, Equality, Fraternity.'' Some wore masks so they could not be identified, a reflection of the fear that many Chinese feel after the June 3-4 crackdown on the pro-democracy protesters. `` I came to see an unusual parade, and I got exactly what I wanted,'' said <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernes </PERSON>, an insurance salesman. `` It was fabulous, but the only sketch that had any connection to the revolution and its ideals was the Chinese.'' The 250 musicians from <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> A & amp; M dazzled onlookers, estimated at 1 million, as they boogied and tooted in an all-out salute to soul singer <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>. The band was flanked by two giant floats topped by dancing pom-pom girls and flag-waving Americans. Some brandished messages to the folks back home _ `` Mom, please pay my Visa bill,'' read one. `` Keep Abortion Legal,'' said another. More than 30 heads of state or government _ seven of them attending the summit of the world's main industrialized democracies _ were participating in bicentennial events. `` In the space of a few days, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> has received on its territory three-quarters of the world's gross national product and nearly 100 percent of the planet's military arsenal,'' wrote the conservative <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Figaro </PERSON> in today's editions. The much-anticipated parade, entitled `` The Marseillaise'' and starring more than 10,000 musicians, turned the famed Champs-Elysees into an enchanted stage for more than three hours. Scottish bagpipers marching in the rain shared the limelight with British ponies painted to resemble zebras, a human pyramid formed by undulating Senegalese dancers in native costume and Soviet tanks spewing confetti-snow as they recreated the Siberian winter. The $ 15 million parade was billed as a `` a slightly frivolous opera-ballet'' by its creator, advertising man <PERSON> Jean-Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Goude </PERSON>, better known for his work with <ORGANIZATION> Grace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> and at <ORGANIZATION> Esquire </ORGANIZATION> magazine. Halfway through the program, the crowd drew its collective breath as <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> diva <PERSON> Jessye </PERSON> <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> emerged from behind a curtain of rain _ regally draped in a flowing tricolor gown _ to sing the rousing verses of the Marseillaise. `` Many people were offended because our national anthem was sung by a foreigner, but I think it's only fitting to have the best voice in the world,'' said <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Houri </PERSON>, a computer engineer. Besides the lively and sometimes impatient crowd lining the Champs-Elysees, perched on trees and in building windows, the parade was broadcast to millions of viewers in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. French President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>, joined by about 30 heads of state, watched from behind a bulletproof glass viewing booth overlooking the Place de la Concorde, ringed with bleachers seating 16,000 invited guests. `` The most extraordinary image tonight was the ocean of people who streamed down the Champs-Elysees,'' said <PERSON> Jean-Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Jeanneney </PERSON>, president of the Bicentennial Mission. For many, however, being there was not enough. `` It was a great show, but it should have been for everybody,'' said <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Golden </PERSON> of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. `` We waited for hours and just barely got a glimpse of the top of heads and floats. The parade was for the rich, not for the masses, which really is n't in keeping with the revolution, is it?''

 A car bomb exploded near the center of the capital today, killing at least nine people and injuring 49, officials said. No one claimed responsibilty for the blast, but the government blamed Moslem guerrillas and unidentified `` foreign agents'' who support them. The guerrillas, based in neighboring <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and supported mainly by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, have been fighting for more than a decade to overthrow the Soviet-backed government. The bomb, hidden in a parked <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> truck, exploded at noon on <LOCATION> Nader </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Shah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Road </LOCATION> near the city's center, shattering windows 300 yards away and throwing bomb fragments 400 yards, police said. The blast left a crater six feet wide, six feet long and three feet deep, officials said. Hospital sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, said at least 10 of the injured were in critical condition. `` I saw people on the road. There were people with their heads totally smashed,'' said <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Nabi </PERSON> <PERSON> Andar </PERSON>, who arrived at the scene five minutes after the blast. The explosion prompted stepped up security in the city of 2.25 million people.

Unemployment stands at about 10 percent, and real wages have shrunk an estimated 60 percent. <PERSON> Rapanelli </PERSON> is the the fifth economy minister since March 31, when <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sourrouille </PERSON> resigned because he could not stabilize the economy. The Radical Civic Union lost national elections on May 14. While President <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> remained in office, two other economy ministers _ <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Pugliese </PERSON> and then <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, both national legislators _ attempted to implement economic reforms, and failed. The Menem government already has announced its intention to sell state-run companies, whose annual operating losses contribute heavily to the fiscal deficit and inflation.

 Leaders of the world's seven richest nations today pledged to `` sustain the momentum'' of moves toward democracy in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and jointly warned <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> that it risks international isolation by continued repression. Despite the words of encouragement for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, the leaders' declaration showed no evidence of immediate aid to match the the $ 125 million package of incentives President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> extended to the two Communist bloc nations earlier this week. Nor were there any joint sanctions against <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. A declaration on political issues was issued at the midpoint of a seven-nation summit of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. At the urging of West German Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>, the document was amended by the leaders to emphasize the `` urgent need for food'' assistance for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, where shortages are rampant. The document called for a meeting of `` all interested countries'' within the next few weeks to discuss ways to reward reforms in both <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> played down the absence of specific aid commitments, although the seven leaders promised to consider and coordinate economic assistance `` aimed at transforming and opening'' the economies of the two Soviet bloc countries. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` There have been some misconceptions -LRB- that -RRB- we would come in here with a dollar package. I managed to convey in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> that that was not the case and here it is not the case.'' He said the communique `` vindicated'' his approach. British Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, speaking of the seven summit nations, said, `` We are all very anxious to help. We are all helping each in our own way.'' The leaders reaffirmed their support for easing <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s $ 39 billion foreign debt burden by relaxing its payment schedule. White House chief of staff <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> said this could provide <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> with $ 5 billion in relief. The communique also urged the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> to speed up consideration of new loans for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. `` We welcome the process of reform under way in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>,'' the statement said. `` We recognize that the political changes taking place in these countries will be difficult to sustain without economic progress.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` There seems to be a marvelous unanimity of opinion of how to treat these East European countries.'' <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> last month announced a $ 25 million aid package to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. The money is to be spread over five years for a `` know-how'' fund on training Poles to operate an entrepreneurial economy. Moving beyond political issues, the leaders met today to discuss economic problems and economic issues in a windowless room atop the Grand Arch, a 35-story avant-garde, cubic structure of glass and marble that is <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s newest national symbol _ and subject of architectural controversy. On <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, the political communique urged the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> to withhold new loans and called on <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> `` to cease action against those who have done no more than claim their legitimate rights to democracy and liberty.'' The seven nations _ the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> _ all promised to shelter <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> students who did not want to go home. The leaders called on Chinese authorities `` to create conditions which will avoid their isolation'' and to resume earlier moves toward political and economic reforms in the world's largest nation. On the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, the seven democracies registered their approval of easing <ORGANIZATION> East-West </ORGANIZATION> tensions but said <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> `` remains a threat to each of us'' with its continuing military balance favoring the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. The political statement also issued a fresh condemnation of terrorism and vowed to bring terrorists to justice. `` We call on those holding hostages to release them immediately and unconditionally and on those with influence over hostage-takers to use it to this end,'' the document said. There are 15 foreign hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, including citizens of three summit countries, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. The summit statement did not single out any country as a sponsor of terrorism. The leaders underscored their support for international measures to protect against aircraft hijackings and sabotage in the wake of the bombing of <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> flight 103 that killed 270 people in <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, last December. `` We have agreed to give priority to preventing such attacks by further strengthening security measures,'' the statement said. `` We have also agreed on the need for improved methods of detecting explosives.'' The meeting of the world's wealthiest industrial democracies largest seven came amid a huge celebration of the 200th birthday of the French Revolution, a multimillion dollar gala that has been criticized in the press here as overly extravagant and expensive. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> today offered high praise for the festivities, saying the pageant of parades, fireworks and parties was `` just magnificent, beautifully done, very special to all Americans.'' In the political declaration, the leaders said they were prepared to support reforms in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and to consider `` in an appropriate fashion economic assistance aimed at transforming and opening their economies in a durable manner.'' The Big Seven countries said the aid should be designed `` to sustain the momentum of the reforms through inward investment, joint ventures, transfer of managerial skills, professional training and other ventures which would help develop a more competitive economy.'' After opening their talks Friday evening, the leaders joined in a joyous celebration of Bastille Day, the beginning of the French Revolution. The festivities began with a lavish dinner of lamb and sea perch. The leaders then stepped onto a balcony enclosed with bulletproof glass to watch a $ 15 million parade featuring, among other attractions, the 250 musicians of the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> A </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; M band, gliding backwards in a <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> moonwalk down the Champs Elysees before a crowd estimated at 1 million. The evening concluded with a fireworks spectacular of red, white and blue rocket plumes _ the French colors. While the leaders were smiling in public, there were sharp differences in private sessions over <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>'s attempts to arrange a meeting of wealthy and poor nations to discuss the problems of Third World countries. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> firmly resisted <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>'s proposal Treasury Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> said the best approach to Third World problems was on a case-by-case basis rather than convening an international conference. `` You do n't get solutions to problems by bunching up areas and calling them North and South,'' as the rich and poor nations are often called, <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> said. West German Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> took a middle-road approach. He said he had heard the complaints of poor nations and the demands for the Big Seven summit countries to open their markets to Third World products. There also was an argument in the wings between <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> as the two sides, playing out old rivalries, sniped at each other about everything from the significance of the French Revolution to Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s right-wing politics. In addition to urging consideration of poor nations' demands, <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> emphasized the need to combat illegal drugs, saying he was shocked by the effect the narcotics epidemic is having on youths, according to French spokesman <PERSON> Hubert </PERSON> <PERSON> Vedrine </PERSON>. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> urged his summit partners to adopt policies that would allow continued economic growth while reducing trade surpluses. Even before the summit opened, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> moved to cool trade tensions, which flared up this year after the administration adopted a tough line targeting <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> as an unfair trader because of barriers to the sale of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> goods in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> originally reacted with outrage at being singled out, but both sides adopted a more conciliatory attitude Friday after a private meeting between <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Japanese Prime Minister Sousuke Uno. The Japanese, reversing course, agreed to launch negotiations aimed at removing barriers to sales of foreign goods. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was less successful, however, at breaking a deadlock between negotiators trying to produce a debt-reduction plan for <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials announced later that the administration would be willing to extend an emergency loan of between $ 1 billion and $ 2 billion to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> if the money would help break a deadlock in current negotiations between <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and the commercial banks that hold the bulk of its debt.

 Here is the official text of the political declaration issued Saturday by the world's seven major industrialized nations.

<NOTE>EAST-WEST RELATIONS:</NOTE>
<TEXT>
 1. We, the leaders of our seven countries and the representatives of the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>, reaffirm the universal and supreme importance which we attach to freedom, democracy and the promotion of human rights. 2. We see signs of this same desire for greater freedom and democracy in the East. The people there, including the young people, are reasserting these values and calling for a pluralist democratic society. Some of their leaders are aware of the positive contribution that greater freedom and democracy can make to the modernization of their countries and are starting to make changes to their laws, practices and institutions. Others are still endeavoring to resist this movement by taking repressive measures which we strongly condemn. 3. We hope that freedom will be broadened and democracy strengthened and that they will form the basis, after decades of military confrontation, ideological antagonism and mistrust, for increased dialogue and cooperation. We welcome the reforms under way and the prospects of lessening the division of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. 4. We call upon the Soviet government to translate its new policies and pronouncements into further concrete action at home and abroad. Military imbalances favoring the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, both in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, remain an objective threat to each of us. Our governments must therefore continue to be vigilant and maintain the strength of our countries. For the foreseeable future, there is no alternative for each of us, within existing alliances, to maintaining a strategy of deterrence based upon an appropriate mix of adequate and effective nuclear and conventional forces. In order to hasten the advent of a world in which the weight of arms and military strength is reduced, we recommit ourselves to the urgent pursuit of a global ban on chemical weapons, a conventional forces balance in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> at the lowest possible level consistent with our security requirements, and a substantial reduction in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> and American strategic nuclear arms. 5. We offer the countries of the East the opportunity to develop balanced economic cooperation on a sound commercial basis consistent with the security interests of each of our countries and with the general principles of international trade. We have noted developments of relations between the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> and countries of the East, in particular the conclusion of an agreement with <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, the progress already achieved during the current discussions with <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and the opening of negotiations with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. 6. We welcome the process of reform under way in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. We recognize that the political changes taking place in these countries will be difficult to sustain without economic progress. Each of us is prepared to support this process and to consider, as appropriate and in a coordinated fashion, economic assistance aimed at transforming and opening their economies in a durable manner. We believe that each of us should direct our assistance to these countries so as to sustain the momentum of reform through inward investment, joint ventures, transfer of managerial skills, professional training and other ventures which would help develop a more competitive economy. Each of us is developing concrete initiatives designed to encourage economic reforms to promote more competitive economies and to provide new opportunities for trade. We agreed to work along with other interested countries and multilateral institutions to concert support for the process of reform under way in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, in order to make our measures of support more effective and mutually reinforcing. We will encourage further creative efforts by interested governments, the public and the private sectors in support of the reform process. Concerning concerted support for reform in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, we call for a meeting with all interested countries which will take place in the next few weeks. We underline, for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, the urgent need for food in present circumstances. To these ends, we ask the <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communities </ORGANIZATION> to take the necessary initiatives in agreement with the other member states of the Community, and to associate, besides the summit participants, all interested countries. 7. We are in favor of an early conclusion of the negotiations between the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. The strengthened debt strategy is applicable to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, provided it meets the conditions. We are ready to support in the <ORGANIZATION> Paris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> the rescheduling of Polish debt expeditiously and in a flexible and forthcoming manner. 8. We see good opportunities for the countries of West and East to work together to find just solutions to conflicts around the world, to fight against under-development, to safeguard the resources and the environment and to build a freer and more open world.''

<NOTE>CHINA:</NOTE>
<TEXT>
 We have already condemned the violent repression in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in defiance of human rights. We urge the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> authorities to cease action against those who have done no more than claim their legitimate rights to democracy and liberty. The repression has led each of us to take appropriate measures to express our deep sense of condemnation, to suspend bilateral Ministerial and high-level contacts, and also to suspend arms trade with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, where it exists. Furthermore each of us has agreed that, in view of current economic uncertainties, the examination of new loans by the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> be postponed. We also have decided to extend the stays of those <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> students who so desire.

 We look to the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> authorities to create conditions which will avoid their isolation and provide for a return to cooperation based upon the resumption of movement toward political and economic reform, and openness. We understand and share the grave concern felt by the people of <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> following these events. We call on the government of the People's Republic of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> to do what is necessary to restore confidence in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>. We recognize that the continuing support of the international community will be an important element in the maintenance of confidence in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>.

<NOTE>TERRORISM:</NOTE>
<TEXT>
 1. We remain resolutely opposed to terrorism in all its forms. We confirm the commitment each of us has undertaken to the principle of making no concessions to terrorists or their sponsors and to cooperating, bilaterally and in all relevant international fora, in combatting terrorism. We reiterate our commitment to the policies agreed at previous summits; in particular we condemn state-sponsored terrorism. We are determined not to let terrorists remain unpunished, and to have them brought to justice within the framework of international law and in conformity with the rule of law. We call upon those states which have supported or encouraged terrorist acts to demonstrate by their actions that they have renounced such policies. We reaffirm in particular our absolute condemnation of the taking of hostages. We call on those holding hostages to release them immediately and unconditionally on those with influence over hostage-takers to use it to this end. 2. Deeply concerned for the safety of all travelers and outraged by the murderous attacks perpetrated against international civil aviation and the frequent threat to air transport safety from terrorists groups, we reaffirm our commitment to the fight against all forms of terrorism affecting civil aviation. We reiterate our determination to contribute to reinforcing internationally agreed measures for protection against aircraft hijackings and sabotage. 3. We particularly condemn the recent attack on an aircraft over <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, which killed 270 people. We have agreed to give priority to preventing such attacks by further strengthening security measures. We attach importance to the implementation of the work plan recently adopted by the <ORGANIZATION> ICAO </ORGANIZATION> Council for this purpose. 4. We have also agreed on the need for improved methods of detecting explosives. We endorse efforts currently under way in <ORGANIZATION> ICAO </ORGANIZATION> to develop, as a matter of high priority, an appropriate international regime for the marking of plastic and sheet explosives for detection.

<NOTE>HUMAN RIGHTS:</NOTE>
<TEXT>
 In 1789, the rights of man and of the citizen were solemnly proclaimed. Just over 40 years ago, the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> adopted the <ORGANIZATION> Universal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Declaration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION>, which have been further developed and codified and are now embodiesd in the Covenants on Civil and <ORGANIZATION> Political </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> and on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights. We reaffirm our commitment to freedom, democratic principles and human rights. We reaffirm our belief in the rule of law which respects and protects without fear or favor the rights and liberties of every citizen, and provides the setting in which the human spirit can develop in freedom and diversity. Human rights are a matter of legitimate international concern. We commit ourselves again to encouraging and promoting the universal respect for human rights and fundamental freedoms. Looking toward the future, we see opportunities as well as threats; this impels us to pledge our firm commitment to uphold international standards of human rights and to confirm our willingness to reaffirm them and to develop them further. We stress the protection of freedom of thought, conscience and religion, and of freedom of opinion and expression; for without these freedoms, other rights can not be fully realized. We stress also respect for the rule of law and the plurality of opinion, for without them there can be neither representative government nor democracy. We believe equally in freedom of association in a pluralist society. We hold that the right of each individual to physical integrity and dignity must be guaranteed. We abhor and condemn torture in all its forms. We believe that all human beings must act toward each other in a spirit of fraternity. We believe that everyone has a right to equality of opportunity as well as to own property, alone or in association with others. Extreme poverty and exclusion from society violate the dignity of everyone enduring them. Those who suffer or are in need should be supported. We stress that the rights of the child, the disabled and the elderly require special protection. We consider that developments in the human sciences, for instance the progress achieved in genetics and organ transplantation, must be applied in accordance with all human rights if the dignity of human beings is to be preserved. We, the present generation, have an obligation to ensure that future generations will inherit a healthy environment. We reaffirm our belief that these rights and freedoms can not be properly safeguarded without the rule of law, impartial justice and genuine democratic institutions.

 The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration today raised the possibility of a breakthrough within the next 24 hours or so in the drawn-out debt negotiations between <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and its private bankers. `` It is in the dotting the ` i' and crossing the ` t' stage on some of the tough details that are important both of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and the banks,'' White House chief of staff <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> told reporters at the economic summit of the seven major industrialized nations. The White House would like to have a deal to show to its partners at the summit. The negotiations have become a test case of the administration's new strategy for dealing with the $ 1.3 trillion debt of the developing nations The new approach, representing a major shift in American policy, emphasizes debt reduction or forgiveness. <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>, showing his thumb and index finger nearly touching, said <LOCATION> Mexican </LOCATION> officials and private bankers `` are now about that far apart.'' He said there was expected to be another bargaining session `` in the next 24 hours or so. And it is hoped that at that meeting substantially most of, if not all, of that gap will be closed.'' Meanwhile, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and the leaders of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> opened their first full day of talks today with an agreement to postpone new <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> loans to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. The leaders noted in a statement that they already had condemned `` the violent repression. ... We urge the Chinese authorities to cease action against those who have done no more than claim their legitimate rights to democracy and liberty.'' During the morning session, the leaders and their finance ministers discussed the worrisome rise in inflation rates. `` They all recognize that inflation is a danger, even though some are more seriously affected at the moment,'' said a <LOCATION> Canadian </LOCATION> official, demanding anonymity. `` Inflation has to be considered as a matter of very high priority,'' he added. A spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>, who demanded anonymity, said senior officials of some private banks met here Friday afternoon with some of the indebted nations, including <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. `` They are very close to an agreement with <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> but not before the end of the summit,'' he said. The 12-nation trading bloc, also known as the Common Market, also attends the gathering. The <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said, `` The problem was that until about 10 days ago the banks were sending extremely junior officials to negotiate with very senior officials, sometimes ministers of finance, from the indebted countries.'' <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>, asked about the elevation of the discussions, said, `` It is amazing what can happen when you get the folks who can make the decisions involved in the process.'' On Friday, <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> pressed the demand of poorer nations for a special conference of the rich and poor countries to discuss the plight of the Third World. But the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> resisted that approach. Treasury Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> insisted that handling Third World problems on a case-by-case basis, the approach the richer nations currently take, is better than an international conference. <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> unveiled the new American debt approach last spring. Several other nations have approved the move, but some <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> allies also expressed reservations about what they viewed as government bailouts. <PERSON> Nigel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s chancellor of the exchequer, said, `` What is important is we have agreed -LRB- on -RRB- this extension of the debt strategy,'' referring to the American plan. `` And the commercial banks need to be absolutely clear there is no new initiative coming forward,'' he said. `` That is the position, and it is up to them to negotiate a debt reduction agreement with the debtor countries, starting with <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was willing to work with the other industrialized nations to arrange a $ 1 billion to $ 2 billion emergency loan to help <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> meet its obligations while it negotiates with private bankers for a new debt accord. <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, with a loan portfolio of $ 100 billion, is the developing world's second largest debtor after <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> signaled his support for urgent assistance for <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. That country, he told French television, `` is on the edge of an explosion because of the weight of its debt and the impossibility of carrying the burden.'' `` No one,'' he said, `` has an interest in this explosion taking place, which would mean more misery for a suffering people.'' <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> owes private lenders $ 54 billion, with about $ 15 billion due American banks. In its negotiations with bankers, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> wants to slash both its overall debt and the amount of its annual interest payments, which run about $ 10 billion a year. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> also took steps as the summit opened to lower trade tensions between the two countries. The Japanese agreed to a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> proposal to launch negotiations aimed at removing barriers to the sale of foreign goods. The talks will focus on so-called structural rigidities, broad-based barriers such as the Japanese distribution system. The Japanese, who had originally balked at the idea of such talks, agreed to a one-year deadline to come up with results.

 A leftist group has claimed responsibility for the bombing that injured seven <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> soldiers. `` Yankee soldiers are only safe in their own land because here they are the target of our bullets and explosives,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Morazanista </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> said in a communique issued Friday. The front, thought to be an arm of the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> founded in 1979, has claimed responsibility for at least five other attacks, including three this year. Twenty-two <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soldiers were injured in those incidents. `` The Morazanista sword is raised to expel or eliminate gringo invaders,'' said the communique, which was delivered to the newspaper <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prensa </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pedro </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sula </LOCATION>, 125 miles north of the capital. Police said a homemade bomb was thrown Thursday night at a group of nine <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> military policemen in civilian clothes as they passed by the <LOCATION> Lido </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Discotheque </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ceiba </LOCATION>, a coastal town 200 miles north of <LOCATION> Tegucigalpa </LOCATION>.

 A police officer crawled through the false ceiling of a closed nightclub for more than five hours trying to capture a burglary suspect who led him on a dark, dirty chase. `` It got to the point where it started to be funny, even though I did n't know if the guy had a gun,'' Patrolman <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Maggio </PERSON> said after Friday morning's marathon. The incident began at about 4 a.m. when police responded to an alarm at <LOCATION> Cunimondo </LOCATION>'s Keyboard jazz club. Before officers entered the club, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Vertullo </PERSON>, 27, of <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> climbed up into the space between the building's suspended ceiling and the building's original ceiling, police said A second man apparently escaped, police said. <PERSON> Maggio </PERSON> crawled up into the ceiling after the man, and spent the next few hours trying to find him and catch him as other officer stood by. `` He was lying around most of the time and I was the one doing most of the crawling,'' <PERSON> Maggio </PERSON> said. `` I'd crawl and he would double back on me. He was smart.'' At one point, <PERSON> Maggio </PERSON> said, he tried to talk the guy into surrendering. `` He said ` OK' and ducked behind some ductwork and disappeared.'' After hours of crawling through wires, nooks and crannies, <PERSON> Maggio </PERSON> and other officers finally used a rope to pull the man out of his final hiding place, a gap between the outside and interior walls of the club. After being taken to the police station, Vertullo fell to the floor of his cell. He was taken to <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Margaret </LOCATION><LOCATION> 's </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, where he tried to escape, <PERSON> Maggio </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Budget Crunch Pitting Small Programs Against Popular Ones</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Outside the closed meeting rooms of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appropriations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> last week, the view was the same: clusters of men and women leaning against walls, talking, reading newspapers, killing time. It was a vigil of lobbyists, waiting for members of the Appropriations subcommittees to strike their deals and map in private how the government would spend more than half of the $ 1.17 trillion federal budget for the 1990 fiscal year. For many of the lobbyists, the wait was grim. After years of federal budget constraints, advocates for programs that could once count on generous government treatment are finding Uncle <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> stingier than he used to be. And they're competing with each other for the same scarce federal dollars. `` The first clue is that attendance here is 10 percent of what it usually is,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>, motioning down the <ORGANIZATION> Rayburn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Office Building corridor, as he and other lobbyists waited outside a meeting of the Appropriations labor, health and human services subcommittee. `` That's because there's no money.'' <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>, lobbying for low-income programs, was exaggerating, but only slightly. The labor subcommittee has jurisdiction over the government's health, welfare and education programs, a $ 155 billion slice of the federal pie for the coming fiscal year, which begins Oct. 1 But law requires that about two-thirds of that be spent on specific programs. The rest of it is up for grabs, and small programs with limited appeal to lawmakers are finding themselves competing for funds with politically popular initiatives for education, AIDS research, the homeless and the like. This strikes fear in the hearts of lobbyists for the government's less visible programs `` Poverty is n't popular,'' said <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>. `` What we're seeing is an understated but very definite realignment of government priorities. We're seeing interest flow in three or four areas, and an ending of the government role in other areas.'' Outside another closed door, this one in the Capitol basement, another group of lobbyists waited as the Appropriations treasury and <ORGANIZATION> postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> subcommittee </ORGANIZATION> wrote its $ 18.5 billion bill. Some of them were working on behalf of postal subsidies for small newspapers, charities, unions and schools, which are entitled to lower mailing rates. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration had tried to terminate the $ 430 million program, and President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has proposed limiting it. Advocates were hoping to win a slight increase for the subsidies, but they acknowledged they faced formidable competition for federal funds from another area within the subcommittee's jurisdiction. `` The big issue in this committee is drug enforcement,'' said <PERSON> Carolyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Emigh </PERSON>, counsel for the <ORGANIZATION> Non-Profit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mailers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. Anti-drug programs are among the most popular programs on Capitol Hill these days, as lawmakers heed polls indicating that drugs are the foremost problem on the minds of voters. Their appeal makes it easy for members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to lavish them with money. `` Right now drugs are pretty high on the list,'' Sen. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appropriations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, acknowledged in an Congressional spending priorities are easy to discern by studying the way the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appropriations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> divided up the $ 658 billion it oversees among its 13 subcommittees. The three largest increases over 1989 spending levels were of $ 5.3 billion to the subcommittee that oversees veterans, housing, science and space programs; $ 4 billion to the panel that controls health and education; and $ 1.8 billion to the subcommittee with jurisdiction over law enforcement. That still left <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> fielding complaints at a committee meeting last week that several subcommittees had been granted too little money. The tight money seems not to have stopped lawmakers themselves from seeking funds for projects within their home districts, however. <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON> said the Appropriations interior subcommittee, which he also chairs, has so far received 1,971 requests for money for projects. And Sen. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Harkin </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Iowa </LOCATION>, chairman of the Appropriations labor, health and human services panel, said he had gotten 455 requests.

<HEAD>Debt Reduction Vital To Economic Recovery</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRIS ANGELO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> badly needs the help President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is offering to reduce payments on its foreign debt, but even with substantial relief, coaxing the country out of seven years of stagnation may be a slow process. `` Mexican as well as foreign investors are waiting for the starting flag that the solution to the debt negotiations will give,'' said President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON>, who met with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> last week. Attention was focused last week on talks between <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and creditor banks as world leaders gathered in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> for an economic summit. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wanted an agreement as a showpiece for its strategy to reduce the Third World's $ 1.3 trillion debt. The lengthy negotiations apparently snagged, and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> tried to give them a boost by offering <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> a temporary loan of $ 1 billion to $ 2 billion. The offer appeared to be aimed at showing banks and other creditor nations the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would put its money where its mouth is. For <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, an agreement would mean both money and a psychological boost, two elements needed to reignite growth. <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> owes $ 107.4 billion and maintains that its economy is hobbled because it must spend $ 16 billion every year to pay the interest and principal. <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> wants to reduce those payments by $ 7 billion, money that could then be invested in industrial expansion to provide jobs. <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> has one million young people entering the job market every year, creating tremendous social pressure _ some of which is relieved by emigration to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. What can happen when a social system is under stress was seen earlier this year when rioting broke out in <LOCATION> Caracas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>, and food stores were looted in <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>. One private economist compared <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> to a family whose loan payments leave little left over even for basics like rent, food or transportation. The family cuts spending and tries to increase its income to avoid taking on more loans, but all its money goes into the loan payments and it remains poor. <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> incurred most of its debt between 1976 and 1982, when eager banks pressed money on a nation that thought oil had made it rich. But the price of oil crashed and growth in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> for the past six years has averaged about zero. The buying power of the average paycheck has been cut in half. `` When we talk about growth, it means to stop the fall in buying power, to stop the process of impoverishment of Mexican society,'' said <PERSON> Jacobo </PERSON> <PERSON> Zaidenweber </PERSON>, a textile manufacturer who is president of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S.-Mexico </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>. To turn the situation around requires investment. That's where foreign debt reduction comes in. `` If a satisfactory agreement with respect to the debt is reached, the necessary conditions to resume growth will be there,'' said <PERSON> Nora </PERSON> <PERSON> Lustig </PERSON>, an economics professor at the <ORGANIZATION> Colegio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mexico </ORGANIZATION> and a visiting fellow at the <ORGANIZATION> Brookings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The agreement being discussed by the banks and <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> calls for approximately 35 percent of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s debt to be written off and for other adjustments in the debt structure to reduce the load. Some banks are reportedly asking for a clause that would increase payments once <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s economy improves, but upping payments might also cut off a recovery. Part of what <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> gains will go to buying back debt at a discount, economists say. The rest can be used for investment in infrastructure that could prime the pump for the private sector. With fewer payments to make, the government will need to borrow less money. That will put less pressure on domestic credit markets and make more money available for the private sector at lower rates. Increased confidence would attract foreign investment and, perhaps even more important, help bring back billions invested abroad by wealthy Mexicans. Capital flight, according to recent reports, has already ceased. <PERSON> Zaidenweber </PERSON> said a debt agreement will help him expand his textile plants to compete with imports and increase exports. `` We have to grow to lower costs and get more modern equipment to increase quality,'' he said. The government has set the stage for recovery with a program that has pushed free-market reforms. <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> has been a driving force there, first as budget director, now as president. Nevertheless, <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mexico </ORGANIZATION> director <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Mancera </PERSON> was cautious. `` The resources of the country are scarce. It's evident there is n't enough for everything we would like to do,'' the daily <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financiero </ORGANIZATION> quoted him as saying. `` Recovery will most likely be slow in the beginning,'' Ms. <PERSON> Lustig </PERSON> said, `` but we might get a surprise.''

 The remains of ancient <ORGANIZATION> Seminole </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION> dug up in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> will be reburied at Wounded Knee next month in a ceremony to be conducted by members of the <ORGANIZATION> Oglala </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sioux </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribe </ORGANIZATION>. The ceremony is scheduled for Aug. 11, at the Wounded Knee Cemetery where about 200 Indians killed by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops in 1890 are buried. The reburial of the prehistoric remains will follow a symposium on archaeological ethics and the treatment of the dead to be held at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dakota </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Vermillion </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Zimmerman </PERSON>, a USD professor. Included in the 1,200 pounds of remains are pieces of pottery and the dirt that was unearthed along with the bone fragments. `` The <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> earth will be with them,'' <PERSON> Zimmerman </PERSON> said. The remains, originally dug up by researchers and later given to the Seminoles, were sent to the university by tribal members four years ago under the condition that they not be used for scienctific study, he said. Recently, <LOCATION> Seminole </LOCATION> tribe members asked USD officials to give the remains to members of the <LOCATION> Oglala </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tribe </LOCATION> for burial. The Oglalas make up the majority of the population on the <LOCATION> Pine </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ridge </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Reservation </LOCATION> where Wounded Knee is located. But remains from other distant Indian tribes have in recent years been sent to Wounded Knee for burial. The issue of reburial has become a heated topic in archaeological circles over the last decade. It's a subject that is often boiled down to a case of science vs. religion, <PERSON> Zimmerman </PERSON> said. `` The whole issue of reburial is an issue that started primarily in <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> and among native American Indians,'' he said. `` What's happened over the last decade and a half is -LRB- indigenous peoples -RRB- have become more politically active on this issue and see it as a two-pronged concern `` Is it a violation of religious freedom ... and who gets to use these remains and where do they put them?'' `` It is n't science vs. religion, it is who controls the past,'' he said. Archaelogists from about 20 countries and representatives from North American Indian tribes and other indigenous people from around the world are expected to attend the meeting.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> committee is backing plans to build the expensive B-2 stealth bomber, but its support hinges on whether the plane performs as advertised. `` If that plane does n't fly, the debate's over,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, D-Ga., the committee chairman, telling reporters of the committee decision to impose a series of requirements before full production of the $ 500-million-a-copy jet `` This is really putting some teeth in ` fly before you buy,''' said Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Warner </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Va </LOCATION>., the senior Republican on the committee The military wants to buy 132 of the aircraft. The stealth bomber is designed to evade Soviet radar but has yet to fly. If successful, the jet could force the Soviets to totally revamp their air defense system at a cost far exceeding the price tag on the B-2, <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> said. The bomber's maiden flight had been planned for today in <LOCATION> Palmdale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, but it was delayed for at least two or three days because of a low fuel pressure reading on one of the plane's gauges, the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> said. In its $ 305 billion defense bill, approved Friday, the committee backed <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> on a broad swath of issues. It supported his decision to end production of several weapons including the F-14D fighter jet. But the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> last month overruled both <LOCATION> Cheney </LOCATION> and its own chairman and voted to authorize production of the newest version of that fighter. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> panel parted ways with <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> when it voted to finish research and development of the controversial V-22 `` Osprey'' tilt-rotor aircraft. It invited <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> to change his mind on canceling that program. The <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> is backing the program to produce the Osprey, which takes off like a helicopter and then flies like an airplane, but <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> decided to cancel it. The committee approved <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON>'s request to end several other weapons programs, including production of the F15-E fighter after fiscal 1991, the Apache helicopter after fiscal 1991, the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Helicopter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Improvement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> missile, the M88 tank-recovery tow vehicle, and an SSN-688 nuclear submarine. <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> said he expected a fight in the full <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> on the committee's decision to increase spending on the Strategic Defense Initiative by $ 800 million next year, to $ 4.5 billion. That's $ 366 million below the administration request. The committee also: _ Endorsed a 3.6 percent military pay raise, along with increases in flight pay and medical benefits _ Earmarked additional spending for cleaning up waste at <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> military nuclear facilities to $ 1.8 billion, $ 418 million above the administration request Additional money would also be provided for research on new cleanup techniques. _ Included $ 100 million for research on the proposed aerospace plane, first proposed by former President <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, which would take off and land like a regular jet but flies at great speeds in the upper atmosphere _ Direct the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to reduce emissions of ozone-depleting chemicals into the atmosphere The committee also provided $ 30 million for developing lighter and more lethal weapons for infantry soldiers. <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> said sometimes the infantry soldiers are given short shrift compared to the more complex weapons programs.

 The century-old legend of an admitted cannibal has become grist for local jokes and promotions, but a legal expert hopes the tools of modern forensic science will lay to rest questions about the case. <PERSON> Alferd </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Packer </PERSON> admitted eating the flesh of some of his five fellow gold prospectors in 1874, but claimed he did so to avert starvation after the men died while marooned in the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION>. He was eventually convicted of manslaughter after two trials nearly a decade later. On Monday, a group of anthropologists, archaeologists and pathologists will attempt to exhume the remains of the five victims near the mountain town of <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, about 170 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>. The expedition is the brainchild of <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Starrs </PERSON>, a professor of law and forensic sciences at <ORGANIZATION> George </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Starrs </PERSON> has used the <PERSON> Packer </PERSON> case as an example in his classes because of the nature of the evidence presented at his two murder trials. He believes scientific examination of the 115-year-old remains will determine whether <PERSON> Packer </PERSON> really killed the gold diggers and then ate them. <PERSON> Packer </PERSON>'s admitted cannibalism has made him a bizarre folk-hero _ especially at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alferd </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Packer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grill </ORGANIZATION>, where annual eating contests mark the end of the school year. The legend arose out of the <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rockies </ORGANIZATION> in the winter of 1874. <PERSON> Packer </PERSON>, a 42-year-old harness maker plagued with epilepsy, convinced a group of prospectors in <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> he could lead them to the <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> gold fields. Five men stayed with him until they became marooned in the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION>. On April 16, 1874, a rosy-cheeked <PERSON> Packer </PERSON> walked into the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pinos </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, at what is now the town of <LOCATION> Sagauche </LOCATION>. Authorities became suspicious when they found he was carrying several neatly wrapped packages of human flesh. <PERSON> Packer </PERSON> admitted shooting one man, <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> <PERSON> Bell </PERSON>, in self defense, but said <PERSON> Bell </PERSON> killed the other four with a hatchet while he was looking for a route out of the mountains. He claimed starvation drove him to eat the flesh of the dead prospectors. Several months later, <PERSON> Packer </PERSON> fled just before artist <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Randolph </PERSON>, on assignment for <PERSON> Harper </PERSON>'s Weekly, discovered and sketched the five bodies. <PERSON> Packer </PERSON> was arrested in 1883 in <LOCATION> Cheyenne </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wyo. </LOCATION>, and was taken to the then-new mining camp of <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> where he was convicted of murdering one of the prospectors, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Swan </LOCATION>. The state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> overturned that sentence. <PERSON> Packer </PERSON> then was retried for all five murders and convicted of manslaughter at <LOCATION> Gunnison </LOCATION>. In addition to <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Swan </PERSON>, the victims included <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Noon </PERSON>, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> and <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>. In 1886, <PERSON> Packer </PERSON> was sentenced to 40 years. He was paroled in 1901 and died April 24, 1907. Last summer, <PERSON> Starrs </PERSON> visited <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and says he located the burial site of the five men near a bronze and stone memorial to the victims set amid wildlfowers and clover a mile outside of town. `` Until we see a bone ... we ca n't be 100 percent certain, but the place has been maintained as a grave site since the early part of this century,'' said <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Zickler </PERSON>, editor of <PERSON> Starrs </PERSON>' Scientific Sleuthing Review <PERSON> Starrs </PERSON> says the bones should be in good enough condition to determine how the men died. `` From the bones we will be able to see bullet holes and hatchmarks where the skinning knife might have scraped the bones. We'll be able to tell if the victims were cannibalized, if they were struck by a hatchet blow, if they were really near starvation,'' <PERSON> Starrs </PERSON> said. `` My personal feelings are we'll find more bullet wounds than described,'' <PERSON> Zickler </PERSON> said. `` My pet theory is that <PERSON> Bell </PERSON> and <PERSON> Packer </PERSON> conspired against the others because of the general desperation of the situation. For some reason we'll never know, <PERSON> Packer </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bell </PERSON> had a falling out. <PERSON> Packer </PERSON> emerged victorious _ and <PERSON> Bell </PERSON> became a perfect scapegoat for all the other deaths.'' Many of the 219 permanent residents of <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> hope the dig will raise the town's profile as a vacation spot. At the General Store, proprietor <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Eisele </PERSON> is selling buttons that read: `` <PERSON> Alferd </PERSON> <PERSON> Packer </PERSON> Ate <LOCATION> Here-Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, Co.'' T-shirts for sale in several shops proclaim, `` Have a Friend for Dinner,'' and `` <PERSON> Alferd </PERSON> <PERSON> Packer </PERSON>, Serving His Fellow Man.'' The menu at <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>'s Restaurant includes <PERSON> Packer </PERSON>'s Platter, `` for those with a man-eating appetite.'' A theater group from <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Gunnison </LOCATION> on Monday will open a three-week nightly dramatization of <PERSON> Packer </PERSON>'s trial in the <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Courthouse </LOCATION>, where the original trial took place.

 The first flight of the B-2 stealth bomber was delayed for at least two or three days because of a low fuel-pressure reading on one of the advanced bomber's gauges, the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> said today. The problem occurred as a small aircraft strayed into the airspace surrounding the site and made a surprise landing. The Cessna 182 played no role in the decision to scrub the flight, said <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Col. <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennett </PERSON>. `` We decided to postpone for safety reasons alone,'' <PERSON> Kennett </PERSON> said. `` There was no other reason. We err on the side of safety.'' The pilot of the <ORGANIZATION> Cessna </ORGANIZATION> was being interviewed by <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> sheriff's investigators, <PERSON> Kennett </PERSON> said. The pilot, who was apparently lost, was questioned but was not under arrest. His single-engine plane also carried two children. The two-man B-2 crew had taxied to the end of the runway and was in preparation for takeoff when the crew members observed that fuel pressure gauge readings for takeoff were too low. Despite the great anticipation and expectation of a maiden voyage for the B-2 today, the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> was not disappointed by the delay, <PERSON> Kennett </PERSON> said. `` We are still ready,'' he said. `` We will be up when it is time. We are still looking forward to the first flight.'' <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> officials had feverishly prepared the radar-evading, $ 500 million B-2 for its maiden flight, after a key <PERSON> Capitol </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> committee ruled against funding the bat-winged aircraft until it leaves the ground. At 6:35 a.m., nearly an hour after sunrise, the B-2 emerged from its hangar and began its slow roll down the runway in anticipation of the first flight. The plane was arrayed with radar enhancers, reflective material installed at eight points on the leading edge of its wing and seven points on the trailing edge. The enhancers were needed to allow test personnel to keep track of the radar-evading aircraft during its maiden flight. Aviation buffs who hoped to catch a glimpse of the bomber's first flight began gathering outside the perimeter of <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plant </ORGANIZATION> 42 early today, <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> spokesman Maj. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Mullaney </PERSON> said. Several dozen were already in place at 2 a.m., <PERSON> Mullaney </PERSON> said. The $ 500 million stealth bomber prototype concluded high-speed runway tests on Thursday with the menacing craft lifting its nose wheel briefly in the last step toward flight. Plans had been for the radar-evading bomber take off from <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plant </ORGANIZATION> 42 here and then land two hours later at nearby <ORGANIZATION> Edwards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>. While the B-2 was being prepared for flight, congressional opposition over its cost threatened to ground the craft. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, in approving President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s $ 305.5 billion defense-spending request for fiscal 1990, stipulated Friday that no new money be spent on the bomber until it flies. `` If that plane does n't fly, the debate is over,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, D-Ga., the panel's chairman `` It is far too expensive to be a stealth taxi.'' Last week, the Pentagon announced the first flight tests of the bomber _ 18 months behind schedule _ would be held during the next two weeks. The Pentagon is proposing a $ 4.7 billion budget in fiscal 1990 for the B-2. Manufactured by <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, in <LOCATION> Palmdale </LOCATION>, the plane will cost about $ 24 billion over a three-year peak period beginning in fiscal 1992, according to <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> figures. The department has invested about $ 22.4 billion in the plane so far. The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> hopes to purchase 132 of the bombers.

<HEAD>Last Surviving Top War Criminal Dies In Japan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Teiichi </PERSON> <PERSON> Suzuki </PERSON>, a former army general who helped plan <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s economy during World War II and later was imprisoned as a war criminal, died of heart failure Saturday, his family said. He was 100. Family members said <PERSON> Suzuki </PERSON> died at a hospital in <LOCATION> Chiba </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Suzuki </PERSON>, who served as a lieutenant general in the <ORGANIZATION> Imperial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, was the last surviving member of a group of top leaders convicted of war crimes. He was the primary planner of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s wartime economy, serving as state minister of the <ORGANIZATION> Planning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> from 1941 to 1943. Following <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s defeat in World War II in 1945, <PERSON> Suzuki </PERSON> stood trial along with wartime Prime Minister <PERSON> Hideki </PERSON> <PERSON> Tojo </PERSON> and other Japanese leaders. <PERSON> Suzuki </PERSON> was given a life sentence by the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribunal </ORGANIZATION> for the <LOCATION> Far </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> in 1948, but he was released on parole from <LOCATION> Sugamo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Prison </LOCATION> for war criminals in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> in 1955 and given a full pardon in 1958. The trial of 28 wartime Japanese leaders, charged with conspiracy to wage war and negligence in preventing war crimes, began May 3, 1946, lasted 417 days, and cost $ 10 million. Seven of the 28 were condemned and hanged Dec. 23, 1948, including <PERSON> Tojo </PERSON>, who bungled a suicide attempt when he was about to be arrested. The others were <PERSON> Gens </PERSON>. <PERSON> Seishiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Itagaki </PERSON>, <PERSON> Kenji </PERSON> <PERSON> Doihara </PERSON>, <PERSON> Heitaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Kimura </PERSON>, <PERSON> Iwane </PERSON> <PERSON> Matsui </PERSON> and <PERSON> Akira </PERSON> <PERSON> Muto </PERSON>; and <PERSON> Koki </PERSON> <PERSON> Hirota </PERSON>, the only civilian. Among the remaining 21 defendants, one was declared insane, and <PERSON> Yosuke </PERSON> <PERSON> Matsuoka </PERSON>, a U.S.-educated former foreign minister, and Adm. <PERSON> Osami </PERSON> <PERSON> Nagano </PERSON> died of illness while the trials were in progress. Five died while serving prison terms, and the others, including <PERSON> Suzuki </PERSON>, were paroled after serving part of their sentences. These men included <PERSON> Mamoru </PERSON> <PERSON> Shigemitsu </PERSON>, who later served as foreign minister in 1954. All but <PERSON> Suzuki </PERSON> had died earlier of old age or illness. The Japanese war criminals were sentenced Nov. 12, 1948, and returned to <LOCATION> Sugamo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Prison </LOCATION> where they had been held since their arrests shortly after the allied occupation of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> began in September 1945. <PERSON> Suzuki </PERSON>, after briefly returning to government service following his pardon, dropped from public view and refused to meet reporters.

<TEXT>
 A 45-minute chat between <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> and President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> has thrown government and anti-apartheid forces off balance as they try to adjust their policies to the unprecedented event. The meeting July 5 between the imprisoned <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> leader and the retiring president caused confusion on all sides. The exiled <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> described the meeting as a publicity stunt, but as praise poured in from other anti-apartheid groups, it withheld further comment. It may be that the 73-year-old <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>, facing forced retirement at the hands of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> he controlled for 10 years, gave history a push just to spite his designated successor. The heir apparent, F.W. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON>, has not commented on the meeting in <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>, and the government seems to be scrambling to explain it without losing too many votes to the white right-wing in September parliamentary elections. Apparently preparing the groundwork for <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>'s release, the government is transforming its portrayal of him _ from a violent revolutionary to a statesman worthy of negotiating with the nation's white leaders Ambiguity extends even to <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, who turns 71 on July 18 and is serving a life term for sabotage and plotting to overthrow the government. He insists he has not changed his views during 27 years in prison. He has not met the government's demand for an outright renunciation of violence, and he continues to call for the removal of a ban on the exiled <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION>. But <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, in a statement released by <ORGANIZATION> Prison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> a week after he met <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>, said, `` I only would like to contribute to the creation of the climate which would promote peace in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>.'' The policy of the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> and most sympathetic anti-apartheid groups has been that no negotiations with the government are possible until <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> is freed. Yet the meeting and <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>'s statement can be interpreted as indicating <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> has already begun a form of negotiation. Justice Minister <PERSON> Kobie </PERSON> <PERSON> Coetsee </PERSON>, who arranged and attended the meeting at <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>'s official residence, first described it as `` a courtesy visit.'' A week later he declared it `` a breakthrough.'' Foreign Minister <PERSON> Pik </PERSON> <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>, mindful of the need to improve <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s image abroad, called it `` an event of the utmost historic importance.'' Information Minister <PERSON> Stoffel </PERSON> <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> der </PERSON> <PERSON> Merwe </PERSON>, aware of the danger of startling white voters before the elections, said the meeting was `` part of the broader process of preparing the groundwork for future negotiations.'' Only the extreme-right, pro-apartheid <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> has made its position clear. <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Andries </PERSON> <PERSON> Treurnicht </PERSON> attacked the government for talking to the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> and said its `` attempt to enhance <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>'s status to that of a folk hero is transparent and will not work.'' Pro-government news media presented <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>'s commitment to peace as a dramatic change. But it is new in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> only because <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>'s views have been suppressed for so long. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>'s words made headlines around the country and were read on government-run television and radio. His picture, which can not be published legally, has been printed in major newspapers, whose editors believe they will not be prosecuted. First reactions from <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Winnie </PERSON>, and from the Rev. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Chikane </PERSON>, secretary-general of the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Churches </ORGANIZATION>, suggested <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> may have been forced into the meeting or been unaware of its implications. Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> and <PERSON> Chikane </PERSON> reversed course after <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>'s statement, saying the discussions were a positive development rather than a government ploy <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Sebina </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Lusaka </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION>, `` It would be wrong for anybody to believe that the meeting signified the start of negotiations between the black people of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> government.'' He did not react to <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>'s statement, but his comment contained an important shift. He referred to the `` government,'' instead of the `` apartheid regime.'' <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> as a free man, able to act as a politician rather than a symbol, poses problems that the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> has not fully addressed. Although he is regarded as the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> leader, the highest post <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> held before the organization was outlawed in 1960 was deputy-president general. The <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> has a president, <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> Tambo </PERSON>, who has lived in exile for 29 years. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> had set guidelines for the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION>'s military wing calling for carefully considered attacks on government targets, and arguing against acts that would cause indiscriminate deaths, as the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION>'s bombing campaign has done The majority of <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>'s supporters were born after he was jailed, have never heard his words, and have grown up in an environment of black-on-black township political strife that did not exist in 1962. `` There has been built up around him such a folklore hero role that he would be recieved as a hero,'' said <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> Suzman </PERSON>, a white, anti-apartheid member of Parliament. `` But how does one know what he's going to suggest to them and what they are prepared to accept?''

<DATELINE>CHAPPAQUIDDICK ISLAND, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 It's not even the same bridge anymore. New posts and guardrails have been added, but that was some time ago, and now Dike Bridge is rotting. Gulls fly over and drop shellfish on it to break open their supper. Not much to it. No signs, no reminders. But Dike Bridge is on <LOCATION> Chappaquiddick </LOCATION>. It lives oversized in American political history because Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> drove his Oldsmobile off the bridge into <LOCATION> Poucha </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pond </LOCATION> around midnight 20 years ago. <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Jo </PERSON> <PERSON> Kopechne </PERSON>, a 28-year-old <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> secretary, was found dead in the back seat about 10 hours later. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, then 37, did not notify police until 9:30 a.m., long after he returned to his hotel, across the water on <PERSON> Martha </PERSON>'s Vineyard. He said he and two friends repeatedly dove to the car in unsuccessful rescue attempts, and that he was then `` exhausted and in a state of shock.'' Since the accident the night of July 18, 1969, <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> voters have re-elected <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> four times to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> by healthy margins. But most people think the string of events that occurred after he left a cottage party that night probably cost him the White House. The incident has been an albatross around the island's neck as well. Like <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, most longtime <LOCATION> Chappaquiddick </LOCATION> residents do n't like to discuss the accident. It is a bitter memory, the day their pastoral existence became the focus of the worst sort of publicity _ the heir to the <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> family dynasty had sullied not just his reputation but theirs, too. When asked about the accident and the impact it's had on their lives, Vineyarders who have lived in <LOCATION> Edgartown </LOCATION> or on <LOCATION> Chappaquiddick </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> for more than 20 years often become silent. One <LOCATION> Edgartown </LOCATION> real estate agent, usually smiling and friendly, momentarily choked up when asked about the accident and then refused to discuss it. <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Tomassian </PERSON>, the head of the <ORGANIZATION> Martha </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vineyard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Historical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Preservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, has lived in <LOCATION> Edgartown </LOCATION> eight years. She has sensed some of her neighbors' resentment about the incident. `` <PERSON> Martha </PERSON>'s Vineyard, pre-Chappaquiddick, was sort of a quiet vacation spot. The international attention that centered here immediately after the incident and during the trial, and the focus that has been put on the Vineyard since then, has really unfortunately put the Vineyard on the map,'' <PERSON> Tomassian </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> eventually pleaded guilty to leaving the scene of an accident and received a two-month suspended prison sentence. He was placed on probation for one year. Judge <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyle </PERSON>, who oversaw the nine-month inquest, expressed doubt about key portions of <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s testimony. When <PERSON> Boyle </PERSON>'s final report was released in April 1970, the case was officially closed. But public debate over its ramifications continues. The Dike Bridge connects a beautiful strip of beach with the rest of <LOCATION> Chappaquiddick </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, at the eastern side of <PERSON> Martha </PERSON>'s Vineyard. In May, tall fences were erected on either side of the bridge _ long since closed to vehicular traffic _ and the only way to reach the beach now is to drive an all-terrain vehicle south for about five miles before doubling back north. Town officials are concerned about safety at the bridge, but sporadic arguments over the years reveal another factor in the move to tear it down _ embarrassment over the dubious tourist attraction. Most tourists do n't journey to <PERSON> Martha </PERSON>'s Vineyard soley to see the scene of what has been called `` the most famous traffic fatality in the history of American politics.'' But, as long as they're down there, it's right across the ferry ... `` Yeah, people ask about it every day,'' said a teen-age girl running the four-car ferry from <LOCATION> Edgartown </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Chappaquiddick </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. `` We get a car asking on every trip across.'' Once tourists get out to Dike Bridge, there's not a lot to see _ just a simple wooden bridge across a decidedly uninteresting pond. Beyond the bridge are the dunes, and still farther the vast blue of Nantucket Sound. `` They find themselves very disappointed,'' said <PERSON> Patric </PERSON> <PERSON> Jamo </PERSON>, a waiter at a restaurant on the edge of <LOCATION> Edgartown </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>. `` There's really nothing there. <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Malcouronne </PERSON>, the president of the <ORGANIZATION> Edgartown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> and manager of the <ORGANIZATION> Colonial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inn </ORGANIZATION>, contends the bridge is n't that much of a tourist draw. She says most of the summertime tourists choose the Vineyard for other reasons and visitors might not even be aware of the significance of the bridge. `` It's a whole other time, a time warp,'' <PERSON> Malcouronne </PERSON> said. Whether the islanders like it or not, though, the accident is fixed in their psyche. A headline that appeared in the <ORGANIZATION> Vineyard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gazette </ORGANIZATION> referred to the debate over tearing down the `` Kennedy Bridge.'' Just up the block from the Colonial Inn is the <LOCATION> Shiretown </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Inn </LOCATION>, the hotel where <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> stayed on his visit two decades ago. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> had walked through the hotel's lobby the morning of the accident and stood on a balcony talking about yachts with other vacationers before he filed an accident report with the <LOCATION> Edgartown </LOCATION> police. The new owners of the Shiretown have taken down a sign that hung behind the front desk telling people not to bother asking about <LOCATION> Chappaquiddick </LOCATION>, or what room <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> was staying in. But they still shun inquiries. `` We have no comment,'' said a hotel worker who would n't give her name. `` People do n't ask about it. It's not a big thing anymore. We were n't even around then.'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, who has over the years expressed sadness about the accident, responded with a prepared statement when asked about the incident recently. `` I took full responsibility for the tragedy at the time, and I still do,'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said. `` There was a full and complete investigation by authorities, and there have been extensive additional investigations by the press. I have expressed my remorse and responsibility to my own family, to the <PERSON> Kopechne </PERSON> family, and to the people of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, and I express those sentiments again. `` I have told everything I know about the accident. I only wish that it were in my power to do something more to ease the continuing pain that I feel and that Mr. and Mrs. <PERSON> Kopechne </PERSON> feel for <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Jo </PERSON>'s loss. In a recent <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> interview, <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Jo </PERSON> <PERSON> Kopechne </PERSON>'s parents spoke mostly about how they still grieve over the loss of their daughter Mrs. <PERSON> Kopechne </PERSON> did say she was pleased the foreman in the grand jury investigation of her daughter's death had recently renewed his assertion that officials tried to cover up information to protect <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>. She had little to say about <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, but in another interview with a magazine she and her husband had harsh words for the senator. `` He was worried about himself, not <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Jo </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Kopechne </PERSON> said. He said his daughter did not die in vain because it kept <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> from becoming president. <PERSON> Kopechne </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Gwen </PERSON>, said they had had two brief meetings with the senator since the accident. `` Those were really ridiculous meetings,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Kopechne </PERSON> said. `` Nobody told me anything, and I did n't even know what to ask. I want him to tell me what happened. Ca n't he relieve us of this?''

 Authorities raided hotels Saturday to remove foreign newspapers and magazines as the government stepped up its campaign to isolate the nation from outside reports critical of its crackdown on dissent. Officials fired the publisher of a pro-Beijing newspaper in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> that had criticized the military assault on pro-democracy protesters in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. The Communist government, acting through its official <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, dismissed publisher <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Tze-chung </PERSON> on Saturday. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> said he would fight to stay at the Wen Wei Po newspaper. Staff at hotels catering to foreign tourists in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> said officials appeared without notice Friday and Saturday and removed all foreign periodicals from bookracks. They were told there would be no further sales of Time, <ORGANIZATION> Newsweek </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Asian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Far </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Review </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION>, which have given in-depth coverage to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s crushing of the student-led movement. `` We were very surprised. They came so suddenly,'' said a staffer at the Jinglun Hotel. `` We're just going backward again,'' said an executive at the <ORGANIZATION> Jianguo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hotel </ORGANIZATION>, speaking on condition of anonymity. He said most of the hotel's visitors are businessmen who follow world events and said `` already people are complaining'' about being cut off from access to the news. The hotels said the <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Import </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Export </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> would not give a reason for the raid or say how long the halt in sales would continue. Foreign travelers arriving in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> have been told not to take newspapers and magazines off the plane, and transmissions of the U.S.-funded <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> have been jammed since the democracy movement was extinguished more than a month ago. Two <ORGANIZATION> VOA </ORGANIZATION> reporters in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> were among seven Western journalists deported for alleged rumormongering and violations of martial law. Chinese authorities July 1 also cut off satellite transmissions of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> television network <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION> to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> hotels. The attempt to limit access to outside reports began shortly after the June 3-4 military assault on pro-democracy protesters and their supporters in central <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s Tiananmen Square. Authorities said about 200 civilians, mostly `` thugs'' and `` ruffians,'' were killed in the assault, but Chinese witnesses and Western intelligence sources said the death toll may have been as high as 3,000. The government asserts the use of force was necessary to stop a `` counterrevolutionary rebellion'' attempting to overthrow the government. The Communist Party's new chief, <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON> <PERSON> Zemin </PERSON>, on Friday told a meeting on higher education that the nation has failed to provide adequate ideological education at a time when young people have become increasingly attracted to the West. `` As a result, they are not mentally prepared to face the hardships and complexities in the socialist construction and the reform,'' the official <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> quoted him as saying. <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON>, named to his post June 24 after moderate <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON> was purged for opposing the use of force against the students, also said astrophysicist <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> <PERSON> Lizhi </PERSON> and <PERSON> Fang </PERSON>'s supporters are `` scum of the Chinese intellectuals.'' <PERSON> Fang </PERSON>, a frequent critic of the Communist government, and his wife <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Shuxian </PERSON> have been sheltered in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> since June 4.

 A dentist was accused of passing state secrets to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> after police found military hardware and classified documents in his apartment, newspapers reported Saturday. The 47-year-old man allegedly spied for the Soviet military intelligence service, <ORGANIZATION> GRU </ORGANIZATION>, over an eight-year period, according to the reports. The man, who runs an import-export business in addition to his dental practice in this <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION> suburb, was arrested May 17 when he was about to fly out of the country, the press reports said. They said the man was released last week pending charges. Neither the man nor his firm was identified in any of the reports, in line with <LOCATION> Dutch </LOCATION> media practice on police and judicial cases. The <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION> newspaper <ORGANIZATION> De </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Volkskrant </ORGANIZATION> said police and investigators of the <ORGANIZATION> Dutch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Domestic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> found large numbers of classified documents on military products made by Dutch firms inside the man's apartment. However, it was not clear from any of the reports what material the man allegedly passed to the Soviets, or how much damage the activities had caused. The <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, which is responsible for counterespionage, was closed and not immediately available for comment. According to <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Volkskrant </PERSON>, the papers found in the apartment related to various kinds of high-technology military products, including computer systems. If convicted of espionage, the man could face a 15-year prison term. Dutch officials have repeatedly said the <ORGANIZATION> GRU </ORGANIZATION> and its civilian counterpart, the <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION>, have been stepping up their espionage efforts, especially in the field of advanced technology.

 Easy Riders <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Fonda </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopper </PERSON> joined 900 others for a 20th anniversary reunion and retrospective showing of the classic biker film. About 50 motorcycles were parked outside the <ORGANIZATION> Sweeney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> on Friday, and <PERSON> Fonda </PERSON> called `` Easy Rider'' `` the best motorcycle film ever made.'' He also called it `` one of the greatest Westerns of all times.'' The $ 25-a-ticket gala drew fans in attire ranging from bell-bottom jeans, black T-shirts, leather vests and chains to <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fe </LOCATION> chic. Asked how things have changed since 1969, when the movie was released, <PERSON> Fonda </PERSON> said: `` Things have gotten ... worse.'' <PERSON> Hopper </PERSON> disagreed. `` We're not at war. ... We can all drink from the same water fountains. Women have more rights. Blacks and minorities have more rights. Basically, today, most people have become involved. But there are still lots of problems, especially inside urban cities. So it's the same old stuff,'' <PERSON> Hopper </PERSON> said. The times may have changed, but <PERSON> Fonda </PERSON> said his values have n't, although they're `` broader in their base, more articulate in their exposition and fortified by what I see around me.'' `` The attitudes we put together when we wrote and shot ` Easy Rider,' have been fortified, not rectified,'' he added. He said also that he may have lost his idealism, but `` I'm much stronger today than I was then.''

 Martial law has not changed the summer rhythm of this dusty city. A hot sun hypnotizes its 10 million residents into slow motion, and soldiers stand sleepily under bright umbrellas. The soldiers squint and play idly with the safety catches on their automatic rifles. It is possible to catch them napping, stocking feet sticking out the windows of a parked army jeep. Some people stroll up to them boldly, ask them where they are from and offer them soda. But despite the mantra-like assurances of city authorities, <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> has not returned to normal. Arrests continue of people who took part in the student-led protests for democratic reform. Some people are taken away as looking `` suspicious,'' questioned, beaten and released. A bookstore where liberals used to meet has been closed. The latest issue of a magazine has been halted at the post office because of an article that censors deemed harmful. Books by scholars who are wanted by police have been banned, and <ORGANIZATION> Culture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> workers have raided private bookstalls to seize copies. At least one book has been banned even as it was being published, a Chinese source said. Countless people pass their days in fear of punishment under the government's harsh new policy emphasizing class struggle and the need to stamp out Western-style liberalism. `` I invited you to come to our home for lunch and we bought beer and things to make dumplings, but I'm sorry, you ca n't come,'' a <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> intellectual said with embarrassment as he met a Western friend recently. `` They said foreigners should not come to our homes,'' he explained. Even meeting a Westerner in public made him fearful, and he cast nervous glances around him. `` Things will get better, let's wait a few months,'' he said before merging with relief into the crowd. He was brave to keep the appointment. Many Chinese have stopped answering their telephones and few are willing to talk to foreigners. `` It's like the Cultural Revolution,'' said a <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> reporter who was in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> during the 1966-76 upheaval, during which almost all contact between Chinese and foreigners was forbidden. Asked about the restrictions, government spokesman <PERSON> Yuan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mu </PERSON> said it was for the foreigners' protection `` because there are so many Chinese and you do n't know who is good and who is bad. It is not written on their foreheads.'' All over the city, hundreds of thousands of teachers, doctors, journalists and factory workers who cheered or joined in the 7-week-long protests face investigation. Most will not be arrested, predicted a Chinese source, but they will spend several tense weeks as <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> officials at their work units investigate their cases. At a minimum, they will be required to acknowledge the error of their ways, the source said. Political education already has begun for work units, protesters and bystanders alike. Graduating college students spent several weeks studying speeches by top leaders condemning the protests as the work of traitors. Participants were urged to speak their hearts, according to one official newspaper, but several said they just repeated words from the speeches. Teachers also have had long study sessions. Education appears lightest for production line workers, who are being pressed to make up for the losses of the weeks of protest. Testimonials from protesters have begun appearing in the official media, confessing their actions but saying they now understand and approve the government's crackdown. `` Motherland, country, we were wrong,'' said one statement attributed to a group of students. The relaxed attitude of the soldiers belies the tight security. New plainclothes guards watch comings and goings at foreign apartment compounds and several embassies, including the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>, where leading dissident <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> <PERSON> Lizhi </PERSON> has taken shelter. Chinese who enter a major office tower must show identification. Switchboard operators at some Chinese government units demand callers identify themselves before putting them through. Soldiers check the papers of Chinese who emerge from their stifling homes at night to catch a cool breeze on the sidewalk. After 11 p.m., soldiers stop cars at main intersections and question drivers. When an army motorcycle broke down during the day on one street, a jeep of armed soldiers stopped to guard it while repairs were made. When two bicyclists got into an argument, drawing a small crowd, soldiers quickly dispersed it. And yet the security appears to have gaps. A foreigner recently reported seeing a naked body floating in a canal near his home.

 A custody battle has begun over notebooks kept by former National Security Aide <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> during the Iran-Contra affair: the <ORGANIZATION> NSC </ORGANIZATION> wo n't take them, despite a claim by <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s prosecutors that it is the rightful owner Prosecutors were rebuffed by the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration when they attempted to turn over the copies to the <ORGANIZATION> NSC </ORGANIZATION> staff last month, administration and congressional sources say. The administration is concerned that once the security council regains possession, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> can move to have the long sought-after documents declassified, an administration source acknowledged. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is looking at legal questions surrounding a possible transfer of the spiral-bound notebooks, department spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> said. North still holds the originals. According to sources, independent counsel <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> assured <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Claiborne </PERSON> <PERSON> Pell </PERSON> in a letter June 23 that the prosecutor would send copies of the notebooks to the <ORGANIZATION> NSC </ORGANIZATION> so that they might be made available to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> panel has been trying since April 1988 to subpoena the notebooks, which <PERSON> North </PERSON> took with him the day he was fired from the <ORGANIZATION> NSC </ORGANIZATION> on Nov. 25, 1986. His lawyers blacked out portions of 1,269 of the 2,848 pages of copies supplied to the Iran-Contra investigating committees. The books contain <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s hand-written, daily records of meetings and phone calls about the <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> arms sales and secret assistance to the Contras. They also contain references to allegations of narcotics trafficking in connection with various arms dealers who were supplying the Contras. During <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>'s investigation of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION>, <PERSON> North </PERSON> invoked his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination in initially refusing to turn them over. But <PERSON> North </PERSON> had to submit them three months ago when he decided to testify near the close of his criminal trial. <PERSON> Pell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, pressed <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> for copies in a letter June 20, to which <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> responded three days later. `` It is my understanding that the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> rergards these notebooks as its documents,'' <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said. `` We shall supply a copy of these documents to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> along with a copy of your letter expressing a need for them. `` It would then be appropriate for ... your Counsel ... to request the declassification of these documents so that they could be utilized by the Committee.'' A courier from the independent counsel's office subsequently tried to deliver the copies, said one source familiar with the episode. When <ORGANIZATION> NSC </ORGANIZATION> staffers opened a package containing the copies, `` they refused to take custody of them, saying they're not the property of the <ORGANIZATION> NSC </ORGANIZATION>,'' said the source. `` It was somebody's assumption at the independent counsel's office that ` If we send it, they'll take it,''' said one administration source familiar with the matter `` Some of the concern has to do with distribution after they get to the executive branch,'' one <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration official acknowledged, referring to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' interest in obtaining the notebooks. <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said there has been `` no determination about what should be done'' with the prosecutors' copies `` or whether we should seek to get the notebooks back from North himself. <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> declined further comment. At <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>'s office, spokeswoman <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Belcher </PERSON> declined all comment on the notebooks. North was compelled to produce them to prosecutors under an April 6 court order by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON>. One question is whether <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> intended to restrict the independent counsel's authority to turn its copies over to someone else, said one <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration official. `` This can be simply resolved: go ask Judge <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON>,'' said the official. `` The independent counsel is afraid <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> is going to object. The right way is to give notice that they would be inclined to turn over the notebooks to the <ORGANIZATION> NSC </ORGANIZATION> and give <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> a chance to be heard.'' The wording of <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON>'s order places no restrictions on what <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> may do with the notebooks. It says simply that <PERSON> North </PERSON> `` shall forthwith produce to the Government ... Spiral bound notebooks used ... in the course of, and-or to assist him in, his duties at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>'' from October 1984 to Nov. 25, 1986. Ultimately, ownership of the the notebooks will have to be determined, said another administration source. `` If they are presidential records, they probably belong to the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration and would go to the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> library in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>,'' said the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration source. `` It's pretty clear the documents do n't belong to this administration. They're not <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> presidency documents.'' <PERSON> North </PERSON> testified in his trial that he regarded the notebooks as his personal property and that he had intended to destroy them as one of his last acts at the <ORGANIZATION> NSC </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> North </PERSON> testified that he took them away with him the day he was fired because his lawyer at the time, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON>, had advised him to do so. `` I was advised to keep things that would indicate that I had authority'' from <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration higher-ups for his activities in the Iran-Contra affair, said <PERSON> North </PERSON>, who was convicted of three felonies in the scandal. Prosecutors at his trial were able to make almost no use of the thousands of pages of notebooks in cross-examining North because he had been forced to give them the material only a few days earlier.

<HEAD>Bentsen Wants Rural Areas Included In Drug-Control Blueprint</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The national anti-drug strategy due out this fall must look beyond the big cities and address the rapid spread of the cocaine derivative crack to rural areas, Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said Saturday. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said he is asking national drug control director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, who is drawiing up the anti-drug blueprint, to include `` measures to combat the serious and growing problem of drug abuse in smaller towns and the rural countryside.'' The <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Democrat said he wants to be sure the <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> `` does n't limit its efforts to just the big dealers and the big cities, that we include rural and small towns too.'' In one rural <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> area, authorities report an 80 percent increase in crack cases in just one year, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said. `` If you ignore that kind of an increase you do so at your own peril,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said in his letter to <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>. `` It's absolutely imperative that we have an overall program that takes care of not just the large cities but the small towns, rural areas in addition.'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> must complete the first comprehensive national drug-control plan by Sept. 5. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said he was concerned about a recent <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> memorandum that said crack dealers in smaller communities `` do not merit full federal investigative efforts'' since they typically limit their sales to small quantities. A <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> survey in 1986 found crack available in 28 states and the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>. Another DEA survey in December 1987 found that number had jumped to 45 states, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said. And while the survey noted that crack cocaine remained primarily an inner city problem, it noted that `` recent seizures indicate that crack has appeared in rural parts of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>.''

<HEAD>Eight Weeks to Primary; Koch Makes it Official</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Eight weeks before the primary <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>'s job is clear: He either makes up ground fast or makes plans to step aside for <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s first black mayor, or its first Republican mayor in two decades. `` Sixteen points in this day and age is not an insurmountable margin by any means, as I was telling President <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>,'' quipped <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Garth </PERSON>, <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>'s media adviser, on Friday. <PERSON> Garth </PERSON> was as surprised as anyone Thursday when <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> chose a midday radio talk show to announce officially his candidacy for an unprecedented fourth term. Not that there was any doubt _ he made his intentions obvious last year and started television ads this month. `` I think I've done a lot of good things. I've done a couple of stupid things,'' said <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>, 64. `` I've done things that I would do over and differently but that's water over the dam. `` I believe that my three terms will be perceived historically as very good for the city of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>.'' His opponents, and many pundits, think the outspoken <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> already is history. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> borough president, leads <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> by 13 to 15 points in Democratic polls; the latest had him ahead 45 percent to 31 percent. Getting more than 40 percent of the vote in the Sept. 12 primary would enable <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> to avoid a primary runoff. The likely Republican is former federal prosecutor <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON>, who is far ahead of his <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> rival, cosmetics heir <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Lauder </PERSON>. A <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News-WABC-TV </ORGANIZATION> poll looking ahead to likely November matchups puts <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> neck and neck with <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON>, and ahead of <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>, 49 percent to 33 percent. Two other Democrats, Comptroller <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldin </PERSON> and former transit chief <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Ravitch </PERSON>, remain stalled in single digits in their primary bids. `` What's going on, I think, is the public is shutting its mind to <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> after 12 insulting years,'' said <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> adviser and former <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> candidate. `` I think I hear a collective, ` Enough, already.''' <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> received 78 percent of the vote last time he ran, back in 1985 when voters did n't have AIDS, crack and homelessness in mind. His third term began with a corruption scandal, now all but overshadowed by more pressing human problems. `` Do you know anyone who has solved AIDS or solved drugs or housing in this country?'' <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> asks. His issue-oriented TV ads, featuring regular folks, carry the slogan `` He tackles the tough ones'' in what is `` still the second toughest job in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' That still leaves corruption, crime, education and race _ this last issue possibly crucial. <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> rankled blacks with his criticism of the Rev. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> in last year's presidential primary, and 73 percent of blacks polled say they favor <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON>, the first black with a real shot at the mayor's mansion. The 62-year-old <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON>, a relatively quiet, conciliatory politician, delivered 135,386 signatures to the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elections </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday, far more than he needed and more than three times what <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> collected. `` I'm sure he's pretty good at arithmetic and he would recognize that this reflects an awful lot of support, a broad base,'' <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Said </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>, who began his political career as a reformer, but twice was reelected with the backing of Democratic powers: `` He's the machine candidate What would you expect?'' There have been other ironies so far in the campaign. <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON>, 45, who built his reputation busting Wall Streeters, mobsters and corrupt officials, found himself last week defending the hiring of three lawyers who admitted having used drugs. <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>, of all people, paraphrased <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> in Thursday's announcement: `` I do n't think God is finished with me yet and I want to do more for this city. Then there is <PERSON> Lauder </PERSON>'s multimillion-dollar television onslaught, in which a voice dripping with disgust calls <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> a liberal. A complicating factor in the race is the existence in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> of small Conservative and Liberal parties, which enable candidates to run even if they lose one of the two major primaries. <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> has already been endorsed by the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, as was Republican <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lindsay </PERSON> in 1965, and would run on that ticket in addition to the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> ticket if he wins in September. But <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON>'s stance against abortion has reduced his support, the Daily News-WABC-TV poll indicated. Gays have criticized his opposition to <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>'s proposal to extend paid time off to city employees grieving deaths of live-in companions. <PERSON> Lauder </PERSON>, who entered the race at the urging of Republican Sen. <PERSON> Alfonse </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON>, a rival of <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON>, will likely remain in the race on the Conservative line, and the votes he would get could hurt <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> in a close general election. For his part, <PERSON> Garth </PERSON> says <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> has been creeping up in the polls, from the mid-20s to the low 30s. `` My feeling is he's bottomed out and is now moving up,'' <PERSON> Garth </PERSON> said, adding that polls do n't show <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON>' supporters as particularly ardent. `` The way this business usually works, once you make that turn and start to come back, you gather momentum,'' he said. <PERSON> Green </PERSON> said <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> is behind `` because he's an insult artist, yet the more he now attacks <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Dinkins </PERSON>, the more he reminds people what they like least about him. I do n't see how he gets out of this box.'' Countered <PERSON> Garth </PERSON>: `` There's no way to kill the spirit in him.''

 The country's largest black union said Saturday it wants to form a huge anti-apartheid coalition to coordinate strategies among opposition groups. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mineworkers </ORGANIZATION> said it will seek to arrange a conference no later than October to bring together the `` core forces of the mass democratic movement.'' `` It is important to win over all anti-apartheid forces to our side,'' said the union, which has about 300,000 members. Anti-apartheid groups have been urgently trying to formulate unified strategies since the July 5 meeting between President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> and jailed black nationalist <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, leader of the <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Opposition groups initially dismissed the talks as government propaganda that involved no shift in policy. But several organizations revised their assessment and called it a positive development after <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> released a statement Wednesday indicating he welcomed the chance to talk with <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>. The mineworkers union said the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> African Trade Unions _ the country's largest labor federation _ and the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> _ the largest anti-apartheid coalition _ would play leading roles in the coalition it sought to establish. However, both groups are banned from participating in political activities. The mineworkers did not explain how these organizations could become active in politics. The outlawed <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> and other anti-apartheid groups have said there can be no negotiations with the government until it meets several basic demands, such as freeing all political prisoners, legalizing banned organizations and lifting the state of emergency. The anti-apartheid movement has found it increasingly difficult to organize under the 3-year-old state of emergency, during which more than 30 opposition groups have been banned. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> has been imprisoned since 1962 and is serving a life sentence for sabotage and plotting to overthrow the government. His meeting with <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> suggests the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> leader is willing to talk with the government, though his demand for a non-racial democracy in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> is unchanged. The white-led government also appears to have eased its policy of having no contact with the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION>, which it labels a terrorist organization. Under <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s apartheid policies, the 28 million blacks have no voice in national affairs. The 5 million whites control the government and economy, while maintaining separate neighborhoods, schools and health facilities.

 Mayor <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> is preparing to announce whether he will run for a fifth term this week as even some of his supporters say he should step down at age 71. Eight weeks remain before the Sept. 12 non-partisan primary when voters will select two candidates for a Nov. 7 runoff. Young, the city's first black mayor, is expected to announce his plans Tuesday. He has hinted for months that he would run but left open the possibility he would retire. `` If I announce, then I will announce when I announce,'' <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said, a comment typical in tone of his chilly relations with reporters, which his aides blame in part on media racism. Young, if he does run for another four-year term, would enter as the solid front-runner, able to cite progress in areas such as integrating the police force but also in spite of an array of problems facing the city. He has a largely untapped campaign fund estimated at $ 5 million, and is considered to hold a commanding lead over accountant <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrow </PERSON>, who won the right to face him in the runoff four years ago and is expected to do so again this year. <PERSON> Barrow </PERSON> reportedly has less than $ 300,000 available for his campaign. Young, a former union organizer, has been in office since 1973, the same year <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Maynard </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> came to power in the early generation of big-city black mayors. <PERSON> Barrow </PERSON>, 40, is founder and president of <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>'s largest minority-owned accounting firm and a nephew of the late boxing great <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Louis </PERSON>. He received only 39 percent of the vote when he ran against <PERSON> Young </PERSON> in 1985, but this year has been campaigning door-to-door, while <PERSON> Young </PERSON> schedules about four public appearances a week, nonchalantly skipping some of them. Other challengers include <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Erma </PERSON> <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON> and longshots <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Costa </PERSON> and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> Sr. The filing deadline for candidates is July 25. <PERSON> Barrow </PERSON> and the others blame Young for the continuing decline of <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>'s neighborhoods. Opponents say Young has concentrated on pet downtown development projects at the expense of neighborhood upkeep and services. And some longtime supporters, including <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>'s veteran black congressmen <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Conyers </PERSON> and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Crockett </PERSON>, also say it is time for <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> to have a new mayor. <PERSON> Crockett </PERSON> said he thinks <PERSON> Young </PERSON> should step down for his own health, though <PERSON> Young </PERSON> has no outward signs of decline. <PERSON> Crockett </PERSON>, who turns 80 next month, said he can give a younger man such advice because he has fewer problems in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> than Young has as mayor. <PERSON> Conyers </PERSON> was more outspoken, accusing the mayor of arrogance and saying he has `` an unbroken record of personal and political mistakes in the last few years.'' `` <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>'s dead,'' <PERSON> Conyers </PERSON> said. `` It's time for him to go.'' He said the mayor `` has lost sight of serving the people and has created a political machine interested only in its own power.'' <PERSON> Conyers </PERSON> denies his comments are meant to promote a candidacy by brother <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> businessman. <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Conyers </PERSON> also denies he has any interest in being mayor. Young, an ardent civil rights activist in this predominantly black city, seemed to emerge unscathed politically last year after criticizing the Rev. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s presidential campaign, saying a black man had no legitimate chance of winning and backing <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. But the mayor has other problems. <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>'s population has dropped from about 2 million in 1950 to about 1 million today. The flight to outlying suburbs has left behind thousands of boarded-up, burned-out houses that attract drug dealers and other crime. Some fed-up residents, tired of waiting for city demolition crews, have even torn down abandoned houses themselves. Though Young's opponents have avoided mention of it, <PERSON> Young </PERSON> also faces a paternity suit filed against him by <PERSON> Annivory </PERSON> <PERSON> Calvert </PERSON>, a former assistant director in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Works </ORGANIZATION> who now lives in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. Young, who is single, at first denied the child was his. But in May, blood tests proved he was the father of Ms. <PERSON> Calvert </PERSON>'s 6-year-old son, <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Loving </PERSON> The mayor is paying $ 200 a week in child support until the court sets a final amount. Other issues facing the mayor include: _ <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>'s trash-burning incinerator, which has angered environmentalists who say pollution standards for the $ 420 million project to create energy by burning wastes are too low _ A deal involving the city's acquisition of land for a $ 1 billion <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> assembly plant, which is being investigated by a federal grand jury amid charges the city paid $ 40 million for used machinery worth $ 2 million in condemned buildings on the plant site There's no suggestion that <PERSON> Young </PERSON> himself is suspected of criminal wrongdoing. _ Young's hostile relations with reporters, and negative coverage that the mayor's staff blames on institutional racism Young rebuffed numerous requests for an interview by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. Young has been particularly unhappy with local coverage of the police force, a once-predominantly white department whose racial integration has been a source of pride for the mayor. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, <PERSON> Young </PERSON>'s chief executive assistant, said the makeover of the force was ignored by local media. Specifically, <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said, a group of newspaper columnists `` constantly dump on the mayor.'' `` We do think there is a little different standard for <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>,'' he said. `` I'm not saying that it is conscious or deliberate.''

 <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> has turned over to the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> records that show a former top official passed over financially-strapped housing projects in favor of doling out emergency funds to a one-time business associate and donors to his pet charity. The <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>'s inspector general concluded in a March audit that at least 11 of 25 projects funded through the emergency set-aide program in 1987 and 1988 did not meet agency guidelines. Several well-connected developers received multiple awards from the fund. Seven projects that exceeded guidelines were bypassed; they eventually went under and had to be taken over by <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>, which over time will cost the government millions of dollars, the auditors concluded. <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> investigators said those decisions were made by <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Demery </PERSON>, who at the time was <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>'s assistant secretary for housing. He left the agency last year and opened a consulting business but has been beleaguered of late with questions about his actions at <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>. The department is the focus of internal, congressional and <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> investigations of fraud, mismanagement and influence-peddling during President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s tenure. <PERSON> Demery </PERSON>, 39, in a brief interview Thursday, denied favoritism played a role in any funding decisions. `` It was all done on the merits,'' he said. But department officials, in the report that <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> sources said has been forwarded to Justice as part of its investigation of the troubled housing agency, said `` assistance was provided to projects that were neither approvable under the regulations nor demonstrated an emergency need.'' The sources spoke on condition they not be identified. The Section 8 loan management set aside fund is used to help struggling housing projects that already have some type of government financing. Guidelines allow the emergency assistance in cases when low occupancy or other problems have caused severe financial problems. The infusion of <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> money, through the use of low-income rent subsidies, is designed to prevent a more costly default. The emergency accounts totaled $ 42 million during the two-year audit period; $ 36 million of that went to the 11 questionable projects chosen by <PERSON> Demery </PERSON> for help. Of those 11, six did not demonstrate a cash-flow problem and the five others were ineligible for funding because of poor maintenance, management or other problems, <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> investigators concluded. In addition, some of the projects had not even applied locally for funding, and in other cases local <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> officials had rejected applications, the auditors said. The investigators said they could find no documentation to support <PERSON> Demery </PERSON>'s decisions. What can be found through review of the <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> records, <PERSON> Demery </PERSON>'s financial disclosure statements and other records is that <PERSON> Demery </PERSON> had past ties to at least one of the developers who got emergency funding Several others were contributors to FOOD for <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, a Michigan-based charity <PERSON> Demery </PERSON> helped found. A separate audit of a <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> rehabilitation program also found scores of occasions in which FOOD donors won lucrative government subsidies. <PERSON> Demery </PERSON> attended several fund-raisers for the charity that were hosted by developers. He has repeatedly denied that the donations affected his <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> decisions. A review of <PERSON> Demery </PERSON>'s telephone and appointment logs by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> also indicated that several of the developers who got emergency funding called <PERSON> Demery </PERSON> several times in the period that those and other funding decisions about their <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> projects were made. _ Emergency funding went to two projects owned by <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Rohlwing </PERSON>, with whom <PERSON> Demery </PERSON> in 1984 was involved in a small mortgage venture. One of the projects was poorly maintained and the other scored zero on a test for need, auditors said. <PERSON> Demery </PERSON> awarded Rohlwing $ 342,000 immediately, with the possibility he could get up to $ 1.7 million over several years. Rohlwing donated $ 1,000 to FOOD in 1987. <PERSON> Demery </PERSON>'s phone logs, obtained through The Freedom of Information Act, show numerous calls from <LOCATION> Rohlwing </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Rohlwing </PERSON> did not return a reporter's telephone call to his <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> office last week. _ Another name found a number of times on the logs is that of <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bird </PERSON>, a developer of more than 100 <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> projects who got $ 405,000 in emergency funding for an apartment complex in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> that failed quality standards. To make repairs, <ORGANIZATION> Bird </ORGANIZATION> got an additional $ 1 million from <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>. He donated $ 2,500 to FOOD in 1987. _ <PERSON> Demery </PERSON> awarded $ 142,000 to the <PERSON> Amy </PERSON> <PERSON> Jo </PERSON> <PERSON> Manor </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Grand </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rapids </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, a project auditors said did not meet requirements for emergency aid. The project is owned by a group called <ORGANIZATION> PM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> One </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which donated $ 2,000 to FOOD. A related company also donated to the charity. The president of <ORGANIZATION> PM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> One </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Armstead </PERSON>, did not return a telephone call to his <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> office. <PERSON> Demery </PERSON> in 1984 received a fee of at least $ 5,000 from a related company, <ORGANIZATION> PMI </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, for consulting work. At the time he was a <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> real estate consultant and mortgage broker who did some <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> contracting work. _ One of the owners of another projects that received emergency assistance, <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Friedman </PERSON>, also donated $ 1,000 to FOOD in October 1987. The auditors, however, did not question the eligibility of that project, <ORGANIZATION> Somerset </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> apartments in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Royalton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, which received $ 180,000 from <PERSON> Demery </PERSON>. _ Seven of the 25 projects given emergency funding over the two-year period were in <PERSON> Demery </PERSON>'s home state of <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>. His phone logs show he kept close ties with his business associates there, often receiving several calls a day from <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> developers. <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> <PERSON> Seligman </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Southfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, developer who got emergency assistance for three projects that auditors said were not eligible, said the frequency of the awards to <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> was not due to favoritism but because of struggling developments in low-income areas. <PERSON> Demery </PERSON> approved $ 426,000 in emergency funding for two projects <PERSON> Seligman </PERSON> owned in <LOCATION> Taylor </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, over the objections of local <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> and government officials who said the area already had too much subsidized housing. The third project, in <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>, got $ 347,000 even though it already had more subsidized apartments than <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> guidelines allowed, the auditors said. <PERSON> Seligman </PERSON> said he knew <PERSON> Demery </PERSON> from his HUD-related work in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> in the early 1980s and spoke to him often. But he said he did not believe he had any special influence with <PERSON> Demery </PERSON>, who has said he approved the funding because he thought the local objections stemmed from a personality clash.

 For the first time in its 30-year history, the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Athens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Homecoming </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pageant </ORGANIZATION> wo n't have a Miss <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> to crown. None of the town's teen-age girls wanted to compete for the crowning Sunday night, organizers say. `` Maybe there's a change in the wind,'' said <PERSON> Doni-Mae </PERSON> <PERSON> Rauch </PERSON>, co-chairman of the homecoming committee. `` It might be a thing of the past. It is a shame to see it go.'' The contest, sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Athens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, is not a beauty pageant. Rather, the girl age 16 to 19 who sells the most $ 1 tickets for raffle chances automatically becomes homecoming queen, <PERSON> Rauch </PERSON> said. The money collected benefits the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Athens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commercial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, which promotes business and industry in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> and the surrounding area. `` I am a little disappointed that nobody shows that much interest in helping the town nd raising the money,'' Miss <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> 1988 <PERSON> Denise </PERSON> <PERSON> Range </PERSON> said. `` But hopefully it will happen again next year.'' The queen receives a cash prize plus a commission, jewelry, a sterling silver bowl, a tiara and a portrait session. `` For some reason this year, we did n't find anyone willing to win a guaranteed $ 500 first prize plus a percentage of sales over $ 1,000,'' <PERSON> Rauch </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Laurel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhmann </PERSON>, who became Miss <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> in 1985 after selling 2,000 tickets, is n't surprised by the lack of interest. `` I can kind of understand,'' she said. `` It's hard work.'' The pageant wo n't have a queen, but it might still have a raffle. High school cheerleaders are selling tickets, as are the town's <ORGANIZATION> Rotary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Lions </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> and Fellowship of <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Athletes </ORGANIZATION> Next year, the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Athens </ORGANIZATION> committee might open the contest to boys, just as neighboring <PERSON> Marissa </PERSON> is doing this year. `` We're going to keep an eye on that,'' <PERSON> Rauch </PERSON> said. `` It is a very valid possibility and something we might consider.''

 <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gildenhorn </PERSON>, the lawyer and real estate developer named by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, and his immediate family gave nearly $ 230,000 to Republican campaigns since 1984, disclosure statements show. <PERSON> Gildenhorn </PERSON>, according to <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> sources, is one of several <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> ambassadorial nominees who have been rated `` unqualified'' by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diplomacy </ORGANIZATION>, an organization composed of former high ranking diplomats, including all living former secretaries of state. One of a lengthy and growing list of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> supporters and contributors named to diplomatic posts, <PERSON> Gildenhorn </PERSON> gave $ 100,000 during the 1988 presidential campaign to the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elections </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. The gift was not subject to the disclosure requirements of the Federal Election Campaign Act. The 84 contributions made between 1984 and early this year by <PERSON> Gildenhorn </PERSON> and members of his immediate family are being used by <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Democrats to illustrate their complaint that too many GOP contributors are being given choice diplomatic posts better reserved for <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> professionals. <PERSON> Gildenhorn </PERSON> said Friday he could not comment because he is `` in a confirmation process.'' A report prepared by the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> for the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Gildenhorn </PERSON> would make an `` excellent'' candidate for an ambassadorship because of his `` solid background in law and management.'' It also cited another qualification. `` Mr. <PERSON> Gildenhorn </PERSON> has been a strong Republican supporter being a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Eagles </ORGANIZATION> and Team 100,'' the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said. The Republican Eagles are contributors of $ 10,000 or more in a single year to the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, while Team 100 designates people who have donated $ 100,000 or more. <PERSON> Gildenhorn </PERSON>'s political contributions are listed on a disclosure form submitted to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, which has set a hearing on the nomination for this week. They totaled $ 14,675 in 1984, $ 17,000 in 1985; $ 25,469.97 in 1986; $ 25,250 in 1987; $ 104,350 in 1988; and $ 11,000 this year. The total: $ 197,744.97. Additionally, his wife, <PERSON> Alma </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, gave $ 20,125 over the six years, including $ 13,000 in 1988; his daughter, <PERSON> Carolyn </PERSON>, gave $ 2,000; his son, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON>, gave $ 4,050 and his father, <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gildenhorn </PERSON>, gave $ 5,750. That brings the total contributions made by <PERSON> Gildenhorn </PERSON> and his family to the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> to $ 229,669.97 since 1984. <PERSON> Gildenhorn </PERSON> gave $ 50,000 during the period to the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> or to the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eagles </ORGANIZATION>. He gave $ 2,500 in 1985 and $ 5,000 in 1986 to the Fund for the American Future, a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> political action committee and contributed the legal limit of $ 1,000 to the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign in 1987. <PERSON> Gildenhorn </PERSON> also gave thousands of dollars to Republican congressional candidates. Included were gifts to the campaigns of Sens. <PERSON> Rudy </PERSON> <PERSON> Boschwitz </PERSON>, R-Minn.; <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Maine </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Domenici </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.M. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Arlen </PERSON> <PERSON> Specter </PERSON>, R-Pa.; <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Warner </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Va </LOCATION>.; <PERSON> Orrin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Utah </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Kasten </PERSON>, R-Wis.; and former Sen. <PERSON> Paula </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Fla </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gildenhorn </PERSON>, 59, is a senior partner in <LOCATION> Brown </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gildenhorn </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON>, a law firm He is also president of the <ORGANIZATION> JBG </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Real </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Estate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> JBG </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Properties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Gildenhorn </PERSON> is also vice chairman of the board of directors of the <ORGANIZATION> Sovran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> here He is a graduate of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maryland </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. Other ambassadorial nominees rated as unqualified by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diplomacy </ORGANIZATION> include <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> real estate developer <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Zappala </PERSON>, nominated as ambassador to <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Melvin </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sembler </PERSON>, a real estate executive in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> named to be ambassador to <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>; and <PERSON> Della </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Newman </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, real estate broker named to be ambassador to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>. No action has been taken by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> on any of those nominations.

Ambassador <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Popper </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diplomacy </ORGANIZATION>, declined to confirm that <PERSON> Gildenhorn </PERSON> and the other three nominees had been rated as unqualified to become ambassadors. But he said the academy does offer such ratings, making its judgments based on a comparison of the nominee's biography and the requirements of the job. He said the nonpartisan academy has no objections to political appointees as such but does believe political nominees should be qualified to run a complex embassy and represent the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> abroad with `` dignity, respect and ability.'' Twenty of 29 ambassadorial nomination made by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in the first six months of his administration have gone to non-professionals, many of them large contributors to <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> causes, committee sources said. <PERSON> Sarbanes </PERSON> says the appointments are larding the diplomatic corps with amateurs rewarded for purely political services. `` Political throwaways,'' <PERSON> Sarbanes </PERSON> calls them. `` I think the time has come, very frankly, to get off the money merry-go-round and ask some very difficult questions, essentially about when extensive political contributions are going to be a sufficient basis to gain an ambassadorial nomination,'' <PERSON> Sarbanes </PERSON> told the committee last month. `` It's not true in every instance, but in most of these cases you seem to have to be over the $ 100,000 mark in order to make the consideration list,'' <PERSON> Sarbanes </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Sarbanes </PERSON> says he is not against political ambassadors as such, noting that many of them compiled distinguished records. `` It is not the political ambassadors that are the problem,'' <PERSON> Sarbanes </PERSON> said. `` It is ambassadors without qualifications.''

 Hundreds of hotels and inns closed their doors Saturday after tremors and the threat of a new volcanic eruption caused thousands of tourists to cancel their reservations in this seaside resort. <PERSON> Hiroko </PERSON> <PERSON> Seki </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s coast guard, said bubbles were seen Saturday near the site of an underwater volcano several miles off <PERSON> Ito </PERSON> that erupted Thursday. <PERSON> Nobuo </PERSON> <PERSON> Fukuda </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Meteorological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> official, said more eruptions are likely. Volcano researchers said another much stronger eruption could send ash and stones over <PERSON> Ito </PERSON>. The meteorological agency said there were more than 100 new tremors Saturday in <LOCATION> Ito </LOCATION>, a city of 72,000 residents 60 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. Most tremors were too weak to be felt by humans. Since June 30, more than 22,800 earthquakes, including nearly 600 strong enough to be felt by people, have been recorded in the area. Veterinarians said that over the last two weeks, they have treated 65 dogs and cats for disorders caused by the quakes, <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said. It did not explain what disorders the animals suffered. The tremors and eruption, and the threat of more to come, have dealt a serious blow to <PERSON> Ito </PERSON>'s main industry, tourism. Hotel operators say virtually all reservations have been canceled for the next several weeks. At Ito Station on Saturday morning, no tourists were seen arriving on the special express trains from <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, which ordinarily are packed with a weekend exodus of city dwellers. Officials said more than 11,000 of 12,000 visitors expected over the weekend had canceled their hotel reservations and most of the remaining visitors were journalists covering the volcanic eruption. All but about a dozen of the resort's 550 hotels and inns closed their doors because `` no one is coming,'' said a doorman at a beachside hotel. <PERSON> Mitsuteru </PERSON> <PERSON> Miyazawa </PERSON>, the city's deputy mayor, said all public schools would be closed at least until Wednesday as a precaution. On Thursday, about 200 people left their seaside homes after the eruption to spend the night in Buddhist temples and schools. But most citizens remained in their homes on Saturday, <PERSON> Miyazawa </PERSON> said. The Japanese archipelago, which was created by volcanic activity, is believed to have about 80 active volcanoes. In January, <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tokachi </LOCATION>, on <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s northern island of Hokkaido, erupted several times.

 Space shuttle <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> moved to the launch pad Saturday as workers got set to celebrate the 20th anniversary of the liftoff of another spaceship with the same name, the one that carried the first men to the moon. The shuttle completed a seven-hour trip to launch pad 39B shortly before 5 a.m., and engineers and technicians began readying it for an early August flight with five astronauts who are to release a secret military spy satellite. Meanwhile, others made preparations for Sunday's commemoration of the flight of the first <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>. It was July 16, 1969, that an Apollo command module <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> blasted away from the <ORGANIZATION> Kennedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> here with astronauts <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON>, <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> `` Buzz'' <PERSON> Aldrin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>. Four days later, <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON> and <PERSON> Aldrin </PERSON> climbed into the lunar landing vehicle Eagle and descended to the <LOCATION> moon </LOCATION>. After an historic 22 hours on the surface, the moonwalkers rejoined <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> in mother ship <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> for the three-day trip home. The three were at the <ORGANIZATION> Marshall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flight </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Huntsville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, on Saturday for a ceremony there before coming here here to join with thousands Sunday in remembering the launch of the Apollo 11 mission. Outside the giant shuttle assembly building, where Apollo's <ORGANIZATION> Saturn </ORGANIZATION> 5 rockets once were put together, the former astronauts will make brief remarks and listen to a tape recording of the final minutes of their countdown The `` taped liftoff'' will occur at 9:32 a.m. Sunday, precisely the time they left <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. As the shuttle <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> moved to the pad, shuttle launch director <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Sieck </PERSON> looked back at its namesake. `` Twenty years ago there was another spaceship, also called <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, and it was out at the pad,'' he said. `` It had an important mission and an important payload. This parallels it. Shuttle <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> also has an important mission and an important payload. `` It also will prove we have three orbiters, and that is significant,'' <PERSON> Sieck </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> will be making its first flight since the Challenger explosion 3 -LCB- years ago. The other two shuttles, Discovery and Atlantis, each have been launched twice since flights resumed last September. After the ceremony here Sunday morning, <ORGANIZATION> Armstrong </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Aldrin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> will ride 20 miles in a motorcade to <LOCATION> Cocoa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, where they will be honored at a luncheon. On Thursday, the 20th anniversary of the moon landing, the trio will join President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for a ceremony at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> and Space Museum in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> earlier had set July 31 as the date for launching shuttle <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION>. But agency officials said Thursday that preparations were behind schedule and that a liftoff now is expected during the first week in August. A firm launch date will be set July 26 following a two-day meeting called a flight readiness review. <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION>'s all-military crew is to deploy a classified <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> payload believed to be an advanced reconnaissance satellite. While the counterparts from 1969 are being honored, the shuttle astronauts will fly here Sunday from <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, in preparation for some practice sessions Monday and Tuesday. The crew is commanded by <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Col. <PERSON> Brewster </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Chaos as Thousands Pack Venice for Pink Floyd Concert</HEAD>
<DATELINE>VENICE, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An estimated 50,000 people poured into the city of canals Saturday for a free concert by the rock group <ORGANIZATION> Pink </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Floyd </ORGANIZATION>, set to perform on a floating stage near <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mark </LOCATION>'s Square. By early Saturday morning, 12 hours before the concert was scheduled to begin, alleyways were packed and police were trying to regulate the flow of people in this city of 83,000. The situation was exacerbated by a 24-hour transport strike that caused chaos for inhabitants and tourists alike. An emergency service linking up the islands, however, was in operation. The rail authorities issued a strong warning, telling people to stay away from <LOCATION> Venice </LOCATION> with the influx of rock fans exceeding all predictions. Many people spent Friday night sleeping outside the rail station or near St Mark's Square. On Saturday the square was transformed into a kind of sunbathing area as young people, wearing bikinis and swimming shorts, took advantage of the sunshine while waiting for the concert to begin. The concert was surrounded by controversy from the outset, with residents and officials concerned that the loud music could damage the city's historic buildings. Permission to go ahead with concert was only given Thursday after the British group agreed to keep the volume down and organizers agreed to move the floating stage farther from St. Mark's Square than originally planned.

<HEAD>Director of Left-Wing Hong Kong Paper Fired By Beijing</HEAD>

<DATELINE>HONG KONG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 In a heavy-handed attempt to exert communist control over a <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> newspaper, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> on Saturday fired the publisher of a pro-Beijing paper that had criticized the crackdown on student-led demonstrators in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. The publisher of the Chinese-backed <ORGANIZATION> Wen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Po </ORGANIZATION> newspaper, <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Tze-chung </PERSON>, called the dismissal `` illegal'' and said he would fight to stay at the post. The Communist government, acting through its official <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, replaced <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> with <PERSON> Chen </PERSON> <PERSON> Bojian </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> executive who had been working at the paper about two years. A day earlier, <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> had tried to fire <PERSON> Chen </PERSON> for his attempts to stop the paper from criticizing the June 3-4 military assault on the pro-democracy demonstrators. A source close to the 78-year-old <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> said he planned to go to court to challenge the action. <PERSON> Zhang </PERSON> <PERSON> Junsheng </PERSON>, vice-director of <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, announced <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>'s dismissal after an all-night meeting of the paper's editorial board, which <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> did not attend. He said <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>'s firing was legal because <PERSON> Wen </PERSON> <PERSON> Wei </PERSON> <PERSON> Po </PERSON> was `` backed by Chinese investment'' and therefore <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> had the right to `` manage the newspaper.'' <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> gives the paper an estimated $ 1.3 million a year and Chinese companies hold the bulk of its stock. <PERSON> Zhang </PERSON> cited a 4-year-old resignation letter written by <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> as evidence of the legality of the dismissal. `` Now, we have decided to accept his resignation,'' he said. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>'s dismissal marks the latest in a series of attempts by <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> to reassert its control over left-wing publications in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> and extend the current ideological campaign to this British colony, which reverts to Chinese rule in 1997. After the military crackdown in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> lost all support from Chinese-language magazines and papers in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>'s newspaper changed its masthead from red to black in mourning. `` Today, I ca n't be an accomplice to the murderers anymore,'' <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> said in a television interview after the military assault. The statement marked the first time since the paper was founded in 1948 that it had broken with the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. Support from the <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> media is important for <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> because many <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> papers set the tone for public opinion in Chinese communities worldwide. Many also are smuggled into <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. Since the crackdown began, Chinese officials have repeatedly told <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> residents not to `` interfere'' in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s domestic affairs by publishing critical accounts of the crackdown or helping the movement for democratic reforms. <PERSON> Wen </PERSON> <PERSON> Wei </PERSON> <PERSON> Po </PERSON> continued to refer to Chinese leaders <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON> and <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> as `` a gang of thieves.'' <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> had also reportedly been exploring a plan to allow the paper to become independent from Communist control. A group of American Chinese have formed an organization, Friends of the <PERSON> Wen </PERSON> <PERSON> Wei </PERSON> <PERSON> Po </PERSON>, to raise funds for the paper. On Thursday, <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> and <PERSON> Chen </PERSON> battled over an article on the group. <PERSON> Chen </PERSON> won out as <PERSON> Wen </PERSON> <PERSON> Wei </PERSON> <PERSON> Po </PERSON> published a report criticizing the organization. In his statement, <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> blasted <PERSON> Chen </PERSON>'s story, calling it `` nothing but wanton insults.'' Several editors of <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> publications said <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION>'s actions were disturbing because they constituted an infringement on a free press. <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> will return to Chinese rule in 1997 and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has promised to keep the colony's free-wheeling social and capitalist economic system intact for 50 years. `` But this type of action shows that it's all a farce,'' said <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Yi </PERSON>, publisher of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nineties </ORGANIZATION>, an influential Chinese-language magazine. `` We have a choice: Either report the news or become <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s mouthpiece. Those of us who report the news had best get out of town.''

<HEAD>Strike by Technicians Delays Flights Across Europe</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A strike by French air traffic control technicians disrupted flight schedules Saturday throughout much of <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, causing delays of up to 10 hours on some flights, officials said. Civil aviation officials at <LOCATION> Orly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> said the strike by technicians, who maintain radars and other electronic equipment used for takeoffs and landings, was scheduled to last until Monday. It began Tuesday. Controllers were ordered to increase spacing between flights as a safety measure. The domestic airline <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inter </ORGANIZATION> predicted delays on about 30 of its 240 flights Saturday, and the backups disrupted flights elsewhere in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The technicians are seeking increased staffing and changes in career promotion ladders to match those of air traffic controllers. The <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said technicians should be satisfied with results of negotiations in October, which it said resulted in an agreement giving them `` advantages comparable to those of the other categories'' of air traffic control employees. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> said French controllers had cut the number of British flights handled from 54 to a half dozen per hour, and British air traffic controllers were offering to reroute some flights. The dispute delayed British flights to <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> by up to 5 -LCB- hours. Flights to and from <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> also were affected. The Spanish flag carrier <ORGANIZATION> Iberia </ORGANIZATION> canceled 16 flights to and from <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> countries, and flights out of the resort island of <LOCATION> Palma </LOCATION> were delayed up to 10 hours, said a Spanish air official. The <ORGANIZATION> French </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> issued a statement saying `` maximal conditions of safety are still being fulfilled'' even though controllers were not able to use some equipment normally used to track flights.

 To friends and acquaintances, lobbyist <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Spence </PERSON> was an enigma: They could n't figure out whether he was a character out of a <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Bond </PERSON> movie or a businessman living a Walter Mitty fantasy. Those who attended <PERSON> Spence </PERSON>'s star-studded parties or accepted his money said they viewed his peculiarities _ like traveling with a gaggle of security guards and communicating by walkie-talkie _ as the props of a man on the move, Washington-style. `` He looked like a riverboat gambler, he was a bachelor and very wealthy and always looking for business, but that seemed like such a common thing in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>,'' said former Ambassador <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Neumann </PERSON>. <PERSON> Spence </PERSON> once arranged for <PERSON> Neumann </PERSON>, who was ambassador to <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> and several other countries, to travel on an expenses-paid trip with his wife to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. The 48-year-old <PERSON> Spence </PERSON> is the most prominent of several men identified in the investigation of a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> callboy ring. The <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Times, citing credit card records, reported late last month that <PERSON> Spence </PERSON> had paid as much as $ 20,000 in a month to a male prostitution ring that was raided earlier this year by police. The paper quoted unidentified male prostitutes and others as saying <PERSON> Spence </PERSON> had bugged his own house, where the lobbyist threw lavish parties for the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> elite. Since then, <PERSON> Spence </PERSON> seems to be just about the only person in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> who is n't talking about the story. Repeated telephone calls to his home have gone unanswered. The mysterious <PERSON> Spence </PERSON> cut a wide social and business swath through <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, and the breadth of his circle of acquaintances made the story all the more titillating. Everyone is reading <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> to find out whose name pops up next, said prominent political consultant <PERSON> Vic </PERSON> <PERSON> Kamber </PERSON>. According to the Times, police obtained credit card slips implicating <PERSON> Spence </PERSON>, as well as many lesser-known Washingtonians, in raids on so-called escort services with names such as `` Dream Boys'' and `` Man to Man.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Stephens </PERSON> says he is investigating the prostitution ring, which operated out of a two-story brick house in a prosperous neighborhood, for possible credit card fraud, a white-collar crime that falls under the purview of the <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. The Secret Service, which is charged with guarding the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and protecting foreign embassies, also is examining whether one of its uniformed guards violated policy by giving <PERSON> Spence </PERSON> and several friends a late-night White House tour on July 3, 1988. Officer <PERSON> Reginald </PERSON> <PERSON> deGueldre </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> guard, has been placed on administrative leave. He acknowledged in an interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> that he led a Spence group on a private tour of the White House `` just like I did my family.'' He also told the Times that <PERSON> Spence </PERSON> gave him an $ 8,000 gold Rolex watch. The <ORGANIZATION> Baltimore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sun </ORGANIZATION>, citing anonymous sources, reported in Saturday's editions that a separate apartment Spence rented was searched by <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> officers the night after deGueldre's home was searched. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, refused to confirm or deny that <PERSON> Spence </PERSON>'s apartment had been searched when contacted Saturday by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> contends the call boy ring's clients included `` key officials of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administrations.'' It has identified several mid-level officials by name. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Balach </PERSON> resigned as a political personnel aide to Labor Secretary <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> when the story appeared. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dutcher </PERSON>, a former associate personnel officer at the <ORGANIZATION> Reagan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, told the Times he used the service once, paying $ 155 for one session with a male prostitute. The newspaper also named <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Tapscott </PERSON>, another former <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> personnel officer. <PERSON> Tapscott </PERSON>, who had become a <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> editor, resigned from the paper but denied patronizing the ring. But it is <PERSON> Spence </PERSON>, who did not hold public office, who has attracted most of the attention. What has emerged about him in recent days is a picture of a man who propelled himself into the social limelight by spending money often supplied by Japanese interests to cultivate academics, ambassadors, journalists, members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, military officers and other habitues of the corridors of power. Among those who attended <PERSON> Spence </PERSON>'s gatherings were journalists <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Severeid </PERSON> and <PERSON> Liz </PERSON> <PERSON> Trotta </PERSON>; <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Lilley </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>; <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Safire </PERSON>, a columnist for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>; and former <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Casey </PERSON>, according to other guests and the Times. Much of the money that oiled <PERSON> Spence </PERSON>'s social machine came from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, according to records he filed under the Foreign Agents Registration Act. For example, in a five-month period in 1981, the Policy Study Group of <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> gave <PERSON> Spence </PERSON> $ 110,000. The non-profit group was financed by Japanese business interests and affiliated with a faction of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s ruling <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. Some of those who accepted <PERSON> Spence </PERSON>'s hospitality said they did so because they believed he could open doors to lucrative markets in the Orient. `` He was eccentric but he was extremely well-informed,'' said former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> diGenova </PERSON>, now a private attorney who once went on a business trip to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> with <PERSON> Spence </PERSON>. It was `` sort of a salon'' he was running there, said veteran journalist <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> <PERSON> McClendon </PERSON>, who said <PERSON> Spence </PERSON> paid her $ 400 to write a profile of a political figure. <PERSON> McClendon </PERSON> said she refused to do any more work for <PERSON> Spence </PERSON> when she learned he was being paid by the Japanese. `` Obviously the Japanese were using him to get as much information as they could about the personal habits of public officials,'' <PERSON> McClendon </PERSON> said. `` To my notion, that borders on espionage.'' <PERSON> Spence </PERSON> ceased operating as an agent for <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> in late 1987, documents show, and recently he seemed to have lowered his profile. <PERSON> Neumann </PERSON> said he attended a small dinner party <PERSON> Spence </PERSON> hosted a few months ago, but, unlike previous Spence soirees, there was no `` special guest.'' <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Georgetown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> law professor who considers <PERSON> Spence </PERSON> a friend, said <PERSON> Spence </PERSON> had been sick, but the nature of his illness was not revealed. Some of <PERSON> Spence </PERSON>'s one-time associates say they are aghast at stories about his alleged double life. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> said he has been `` shocked and utterly repelled'' by what he's read about <PERSON> Spence </PERSON>. He said <PERSON> Spence </PERSON>'s glittering parties and highbrow seminars had `` zero to do with this sex thing.'' <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> said <PERSON> Spence </PERSON> seemed to enjoy portraying himself as a character shrouded in mystery. With Spence, there was `` always this invited suspicion that he was really an agent. He seemed to enjoy that,'' he said. `` He was a tremendous name-dropper and had a tremendous ego,'' said <PERSON> Kamber </PERSON>, who was paid $ 400 for speaking at one of the seminars that <PERSON> Spence </PERSON> arranged on political and economic issues. <PERSON> Kamber </PERSON>, well known in Democratic circles, said he assumed <PERSON> Spence </PERSON> courted him because he provided a counterpoint to conservative speakers. Before he was hired to speak at <PERSON> Spence </PERSON>'s seminars, <PERSON> Kamber </PERSON> said, he was `` looked over'' by <PERSON> Spence </PERSON> at a private luncheon. `` I guess he wanted to see if I had the social graces ... if I knew how to use a knife and fork,'' <PERSON> Kamber </PERSON> said. While the Spence story has titillated the nation's capital, it has not amused the organized gay and lesbian community. `` The <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Times story is a rank attempt to sensationalize a fact that should come as no surprise to anybody: that there are gay people in the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and in this Republican administration,'' said the National Gay and <ORGANIZATION> Lesbian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>.

 Syrian and <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> gunners battled with howitzers and mortars around the capital Saturday as rival Shiite Moslem militias fought in the alleyways of the city's southern slums. The state electricity authority declared a power blackout in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and in the 310-square-mile Christian enclave northeast of the city Saturday after it ran out of fuel for its main generating plant in Christian east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. Police said one person was killed and at least 19 people were wounded in the artillery duels. That raised the casualty toll from the 17-week confrontation between Christian army commander Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s forces and the Syrians to 417 killed and 1,646 wounded. Police said the Syrian-Christian artillery duels intensified in the afternoon as shells rained on <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s Moslem and <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> sections. `` It has been almost two months since we were pounded with such intensity,'' said a resident of the Christian district of Sen El-Fil. Forty rockets hit the neighborhood simultaneously, he said, speaking on condition of anonymity. Police also reported machine-gun and mortar clashes across <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s dividing Green Line and in the mountains southeast of the capital. A police spokesman said one person was killed and four were wounded in a four-hour firefight between the pro-Syrian Amal militia and the Iranian-backed <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or Party of God. The rival factions battled with automatic weapons and rocket-propelled grenades in the narrow alleys of south <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. The spokesman, who can not be named under standing regulations, said the fighting ended when Syrian troops intervened at 4 a.m. By police count, 561 people have been killed and 1,554 wounded since Amal and <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> began fighting in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> last April for dominance of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s 1.2 million Shiites. The police spokesman said Syrian howitzers deployed in Moslem west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> shelled a 28-mile stretch of the Christian coastline north of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and key positions manned by <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s army in the mountains overlooking <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. He said shells fell around the ports of <LOCATION> Jounieh </LOCATION> and Byblos and the Christian towns of <PERSON> Hadath </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kfar </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheema </PERSON> on the southeastern edge of the war-divided capital. Smoke billowed from the wooded slopes that overlook <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> as the sound of exploding shells echoed across the battered city. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s gunners responded by shelling the Syrian batteries along the main seaside boulevard in west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Syrian </LOCATION> positions in the Druse Moslem villages of <LOCATION> Shweifat </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Aitat </PERSON>, the spokesman said. The Syrians shell the coastline north of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> daily to enforce a blockade of Christian ports and prevent <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> from receiving shipments of war material and other supplies. The blockade has caused a serious fuel shortage in the Christian sector, where some 1 million people are trapped. The electricity authority said it will continue to provide power to water pumping stations, hospitals and communications centers for two hours a day. The fighting between the Syrians and <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s forces broke out March 8, two days after <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> blockaded illegal ports run by Syrian-backed Moslem militias south of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. He charged that the militia ports robbed the badly depleted state treasury of about $ 100 million a year in lost customs fees. The Syrians, who back Moslems demanding an equal share of power with the traditionally dominant Christians, responded by besieging the Christian enclave.

 The number of pigeons in this gambling capital will likely decrease soon, but it has nothing to do with changing casino odds. The <ORGANIZATION> Nevada </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> has introduced four pigeon-eating peregrine falcons in the urban jungle, roosting comfortably on the top of the Las Vegas Hilton hotel-casino. The endangered birds of prey, now about 40 days old, were hatched in <PERSON> Reno </PERSON> and flown to <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> where they took up residence 300 feet above the ground on July 5. `` It might sound like some silly publicity stunt, but actually the <ORGANIZATION> Hilton </ORGANIZATION> is a tremendous man-made cliff that very much resembles what might be found in a natural environment for these birds,'' <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Geoff </PERSON> <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON> said Friday. `` A second advantage is there's lots of prey around _ domestic pigeons, grackles -LRB- birds with long tails -RRB- ... and there are no real predators to eat them. They've even got overhangs for shade on the building.'' `` We want to do this every year until we have a pair that will come back to nest there,'' <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON> said. `` We're trying everything to save this species which is making a comeback after almost becoming extinct.'' The hotel built a box on its roof to serve as a home for the birds and installed video cameraas so guests below can watch the falcons on their in-room television sets.

 The glamorous and grimy private eye of detective novels and mystery movies does n't exist, according to an organization of investigators who say they're no <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Spades </PERSON> or <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Rockfords </PERSON>. `` The private investigator has always had the image of a carefree, devil-may-care individual, someone who sometimes skirts the law,'' said <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON>, an investigator from <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, Ore. But that image does n't stick to a private eye's trenchcoat, or whatever kind of coat they wear chasing down the mundane details they say make up the bulk of their work. `` People think we're a bunch of ex-police officers,'' said <PERSON> Kitty </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, an investigator from <LOCATION> Haddonfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, `` with a brush cut, a pot belly, a double-knit polyester suit with two rows of white stripes in a green background, and chafe marks under the left arm to show people we've been wearing a gun.'' <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Crowe </PERSON> are among 225 members of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investigators </ORGANIZATION> meeting this weekend in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> to network, attend seminars and conduct testing for a continuing program of certification. `` A private investigator is an average person who's a professional,'' <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said. `` More likely than not, they're the cerebral type. Look around. This could be a group of computer people or sales people.'' Most of their work is too tedious to make a best-seller, the investigators said. `` It's not glamourous,'' <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said. `` You get dirty, you work long hours, it's tedious, you actually have to read, volumes and volumes of depositions.''

<HEAD>Soviet President Says Perestroika Linked to World Economy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFFREY ULBRICH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said in a letter Saturday to the economic summit in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> that his policy of perestroika, or restructuring, is linked closely to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s participation in the world economy. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said the world's other countries clearly have a stake in the Soviet reforms. It `` is obvious that the rest of the world can only gain by the opening to the world economy of a market such as that of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> wrote in a letter to French President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>. <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> is presiding over the 15th annual economic summit of the West's seven richest industrial democracies. `` Our perestroika is inseparable from the policy tending toward full and entire participation in the world economy,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> wrote. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has instituted a broad array of economic and social reforms since taking power in March 1985. However, his reform movement has done more to improve personal freedom for the Soviets than to achieve any visible change in economic performance. The Soviet president said the traditional way for resolving economic imbalances between states was on the basis of strictly national interests. `` However, today such a balance would be precarious if one tried to base it on anything other than the universal interests of humanity,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> wrote in the letter, made available to the press by <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>'s spokesman, <PERSON> Hubert </PERSON> <PERSON> Vedrine </PERSON>. <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and the other leaders had not had a chance to analyze the letter in any detail `` except to say we generally found it positive and supportive.'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said there was no lengthy discussion of the message. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said it is clear that common economic interests can serve as the basis for cooperation, and the proof of that is the increasing number of bilateral agreements between the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and Western countries. `` However, multilateral East-West cooperation on global economic problems are manifestly far behind compared to the development of bilateral and regional links,'' he said. `` This state of things does not seem justified in light of the weight of our states in the world economy, of the responsibility that is ours in the rational and efficient functioning of it for the good of all people and the world community in general.'' One of the key issues before the three-day summit here involving the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, West German, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> is dealing with the $ 1.3 trillion in debt built up by the Third World. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> suggested constructive cooperation in resolving the problem. `` We see points of convergence and complementarity in the approaches to global problems, in particular the solution to Third World debt,'' the Soviet president said. `` It does n't matter who gets credit for the best initiative.'' He said old, artificial obstacles between different economic systems were being torn down. It is urgent, he added, `` to get together on the methodology and harmonization of the economic process.'' `` We are ready to engage in a constructive dialogue on these questions,'' the Soviet president said. The important thing, he said, `` is to find the beginning of a common economic language, to proceed to a reciprocal exchange of information.''

 <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Claus </LOCATION> came to town Saturday, but instead of carrying a sack of toys, he showed up with a job complaint. About 30 people wearing Saint <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> costumes marched through downtown <LOCATION> Hamburg </LOCATION> to demand that the city of 1.6 million celebrate a second Christmas each July 24 so <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> can earn more money.

They did not say why they chose July 24 as the date for a second Christmas. `` Many of our members are students and retirees who would be happy to have a second Father Christmas job during the year, simply because they need the money,'' said a leaflet handed out by the group. The Saint <PERSON> Nicks </PERSON> have some highly influential support. `` They are backed by the real Father Christmas himself,'' the leaflet declared.

 While leaders of the world's seven richest nations met behind closed doors Saturday, representatives of the seven `` poorest peoples'' held a public meeting across town on the <LOCATION> Left </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Burkina </PERSON> <PERSON> Faso </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mozambique </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION> and the Brazilian <ORGANIZATION> Amazon </ORGANIZATION> were represented by doctors, poets, women's and human rights activists, labor leaders and ethnic emissaries. <PERSON> Orlando </PERSON> <PERSON> Melgueiros </PERSON> <PERSON> da </PERSON> <PERSON> Silva </PERSON>, bare-chested and in a feather headdress, represented <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s Union of Indigenous Nations. The meeting of the Seven Poorest Peoples occurred under the auspices of The Other Economic Summit, an annual conference searching for alternative solutions at the same time the leaders of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> are meeting. `` We seek an alternative economic development which will do away with social injustice, the north's domination of Third World countries and the thoughtless pillage of the earth's resources,'' explained the conference paper. More than 1,000 participants attended the meeting. A final declaration issued Saturday night called for a `` radical transformation of the international political and economic system'' to make sure decisions were not taken just by the rich countries, but `` with all the peoples of the world.'' The statement also called for a ban on the use of international loans for arms purchases, for controls on `` destructive energy consumption'' and forgiveness of the debt owed by poor countries to the rich. The summit, held alongside the seven-nation economic summit, or G-7, every year since 1974, included such seminars as `` Education for the Third Millenium'' and `` Without Arms, Citizens?'' which explored the role of private citizens in the peace process and disarmament. Like the leaders across town, the alternative summiteers also discussed international debt, economics and the environment. <PERSON> Konrad </PERSON> <PERSON> Von </PERSON> <PERSON> Moltke </PERSON>, a senior fellow with the <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> and the World Wide Fund for Nature in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, prepared a background paper on the environment for the <ORGANIZATION> G-7 </ORGANIZATION> summit but dropped in at the alternative summit as well. `` In dealing with environmental problems, the relationships are no longer big and small, powerful and weak nations, because we are all interdependent,'' he said.

<HEAD>Tanker Damaged in Indian Ocean Collision Leaks Oil Off U.A.E.</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A tanker spilled more than 1.6 million gallons of oil into the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> and has been turned away from three ports since a collision last month, shipping sources said Saturday. A 60-mile-long oil slick was heading toward the Indian coast, said the sources, speaking on condition of anonymity. The Maltese-flagged 32,000-ton Puppy was anchored Saturday in international waters off <PERSON> Khor </PERSON> <PERSON> Fakkan </PERSON>, and several tugboats were to be sent to transfer the oil from the leaking tanks, the sources said. <PERSON> Khor </PERSON> <PERSON> Fakkan </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> port 200 miles south of <LOCATION> Abu </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dhabi </LOCATION>, refused to permit the Puppy into port because of the leak. The June 28 collision occurred in the <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> between the Puppy, managed by the Geneva-based <ORGANIZATION> Acomarit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maritimes </ORGANIZATION>, and the 24,597-ton bulk carrier Quince, managed by a Hong Kong-based firm. The accident, about 700 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Bombay </LOCATION>, ruptured two cargo tanks aboard the Puppy, which was on its way from <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> with a load of crude oil for <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION>. After the accident, <LOCATION> Bombay </LOCATION> refused to let the Puppy dock because of the leaking oil. Meanwhile, the tanker spilled 1.2 million gallons into the <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION>, creating a slick more than 60 miles long and 12 miles wide, the sources said. Sea currents were pushing the slick toward <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Kerala </LOCATION> coast, and it was expected to reach there within 10 days. The tanker, pulled by a tugboat, headed for <PERSON> Khor </PERSON> <PERSON> Fakkan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Fujairah </PERSON>, another <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION> port, but was told to stay off the coast and wait for help. Capt. <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Saunders </PERSON>, <PERSON> Fujairah </PERSON>'s port director, said the tanker was `` diverted to international waters'' five days ago and anchored about 50 miles off <PERSON> Khor </PERSON> <PERSON> Fakkan </PERSON>. `` The delay in the ... transfer of the oil ... has increased the danger of the oil slick growing,'' one source said. `` A thin oil slick was noticed when the stricken vessel anchored five days ago.''

 <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, her wish fulfilled, had lunch at a 17th century chateau Saturday after touring a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crafts exhibit that made her `` proud to be an American.'' As President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> tended to matter of state at the 15th annual economic summit, the first lady set off on her own. Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> toured several rooms of the 17th chateau owned by the Marquis and <PERSON> Marquise </PERSON> <PERSON> Jean-Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Ganay </PERSON>. `` Look at this, is n't it beautiful?'' marvelled Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as she emerged in the blazing sunshine to tour the vast gardens with their spring-fed ponds, laid out in the 17th century by the landscapist <PERSON> Lenotre </PERSON>, who designed the <LOCATION> Versailles </LOCATION> gardens for <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> XIV. `` I want you to get used to me here,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> joked with her host and hostess, the <PERSON> Marquis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Marquise </PERSON> <PERSON> Jean-Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Ganay </PERSON>. Joining Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on the tour were <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kitty </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, wives of the secretaries of state and treasury. `` Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wanted to see a chateau and pretty garden,'' said <PERSON> Sondra </PERSON> <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>, a spokesman for the first lady. The choice was made by Ambassador <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Curley </PERSON> and his wife, who know the de Ganay family. Like many aristocratic owners, the de Ganays allow visitors to pay admission to tour the chateau at certain times to defray maintenance costs. Strolling around the gardens, Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> called to two dogs to pose with her for a picture. `` Come on you two dogs, they want us in the center,'' she said. Referring to her own pet, she added, `` I hope <PERSON> Millie </PERSON> will take note and not be jealous. She'll eat her heart out.'' Earlier Saturday, Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> toured the `` Craft USA Today'' show at the Decorative Arts branch of the <LOCATION> Louvre </LOCATION> museum, where the work of 183 American artisans, ranging from patchwork quilts to a ceramic briefcase, is displayed. `` It makes you proud to be an American,'' she said. She looked at her watch to see if a wooden clock called `` Time to Say Goodbye'' by <PERSON> Wendell </PERSON> <PERSON> Castle </PERSON> was keeping time. A museum spokesman said it had not been wound. `` I love that,'' she said of an enormous tulipwood spheroid by <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Moulthrop </PERSON>. `` That's amazing,'' she said of a multicolored glass creation by <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Chihuly </PERSON>. `` One man blowing that.

Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> posed holding hands with a glazed clay 10-foot-high statue of a man splashed with garish colors by <PERSON> Viola </PERSON> <PERSON> Frey </PERSON>. `` It's just like in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, when you get your picture taken with the president _ or the first lady,'' referring to the cardboard photo setups popular with tourists outside 1600 <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Avenue </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>New Economy Minister Takes Over; Pledges To Continue Austerity Program</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WILLIAM H. HEATH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Businessman <PERSON> Nestor </PERSON> <PERSON> Rapanelli </PERSON> was sworn in Saturday as the fifth economy minister in 3 -LCB- months, and he pledged to complete the austerity program of <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Roig </PERSON>, who died only six days after taking office. <PERSON> Rapanelli </PERSON>, 60, took his oath of office from President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> in the same Government House room where an all-night wake was held for <PERSON> Roig </PERSON>, whose death of a heart attack Friday shook the beleaguered South American nation. The new minister said he would `` continue the policies of Roig'' in an effort to halt hyperinflation, end <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>'s worst recession in 173 years and stop the widespread hunger that produced food riots in May. A voluntary price accord with businesses that would allow the government to coordinate wage increases `` will be signed on Monday or Tuesday,'' <PERSON> Rapanelli </PERSON> told reporters. <PERSON> Roig </PERSON>, 68, had been negotiating the agreement at the time of his death. In choosing <PERSON> Rapanelli </PERSON>, <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> turned again to the giant <ORGANIZATION> Bunge </ORGANIZATION> and Born grain conglomerate, where the new minister served as vice president, as had <PERSON> Roig </PERSON> until his retirement three years ago. <PERSON> Rapanelli </PERSON> `` is the right man to maintain our economic program,'' said <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> as he joined <PERSON> Roig </PERSON>'s family, friends and other officials at the wake. <PERSON> Rapanelli </PERSON> has worked for <ORGANIZATION> Bunge </ORGANIZATION> and Born for 39 years. He also is vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Executive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> and is a director of the <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Latin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investigation </ORGANIZATION>. He faces a formidable task in continuing the program outlined by <PERSON> Roig </PERSON>, who was sworn in July 8 following <PERSON> Menem </PERSON>'s inauguration. <PERSON> Roig </PERSON> on Sunday announced a 54 percent devaluation of the austral and raised state-controlled utility prices by at least 200 percent. The currency held firm against the dollar, which Argentines use as a hedge against inflation, during the first three days of the week. But on Thursday, the dollar's value on the black market soared above 700 australs, compared to the official rate of 650, following a series of rumors, including one that <PERSON> Roig </PERSON> might resign. Inflation grew by 114.5 percent in June and projections for July are 200 percent or more. Unemployment stands at about 10 percent. Real wages have shrunk by an estimated 60 percent. The economic crisis led to food riots in late May that claimed at least 14 lives. Thousands of Argentines now receive daily meals at soup kitchens that were set up last month. <PERSON> Menem </PERSON> has estimated that 9 million of the country's 30 million inhabitants are `` living at the edge of misery.'' On Saturday, the government sent 140 tons of food to the northern provinces of Chaco and <LOCATION> Tucuman </LOCATION> for distribution among the needy. <PERSON> Rapanelli </PERSON> is the nation's fifth economy minister since March 31, the day <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sourrouille </PERSON> resigned after failing to stabilize the economy. Two other ministers, <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Pugliese </PERSON> and then <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, also failed to implement economic reforms under former President <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON>, whose <ORGANIZATION> Radical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> lost the May 14 elections to <PERSON> Menem </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Peronist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Roig </PERSON> was not a Peronist _ nor is <LOCATION> Rapanelli </LOCATION> _ and his appointment added substance to <PERSON> Menem </PERSON>'s claims that his administration would be non-partisan. <PERSON> Roig </PERSON>, described by associates as a seven-pack-a-day cigarette smoker, is survived by his wife, two sons and four grandchildren.

<HEAD>Government Bans Sale Of Dioxin-Tainted Milk And Meat Products</HEAD>
<DATELINE>THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government has banned the sale of milk and meat products from farms near two large waste incinerators after foodstuffs from the farms were found to be contaminated by dioxin. The decision was announced in a letter to <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> late Friday and followed tests showing that the milk contained three times the amount of dioxin considered normal, according to <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Dankmeyer </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Heath </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. The official described the measures as `` precautionary'' and said there was no immediate danger to public health. However, <PERSON> Dankmeyer </PERSON> added that consumers drinking the contaminated milk on a daily basis would ultimately take in more dioxin than is considered safe, he said. The government also ordered the waste furnaces to take stricter anti-pollution measures and was considering suing them for damages, he said. Dioxin is a highly toxic chemical contaminant that can be released into the atmosphere as a byproduct of waste combustion. It has been used in chemical warfare. At issue is the milk and meat produce of 16 dairy farms surrounding the <ORGANIZATION> Rijnmond </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Waste </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disposal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> near <LOCATION> Rotterdam </LOCATION>, the nation's largest combustion furnace for domestic waste. The annual milk output of those farms is about 1 million gallons but there was no immediate word how much of the tainted milk had been sold or over what period. The government announced similar measures for farms in the area of a waste furnace near <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION> after theoretical calculations showed the same level of dioxin pollution was likely there, <PERSON> Dankmeyer </PERSON> said. Tests on produce from the <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION> site still need to be completed, he said, adding that 10 similar combustion furnaces elsewhere in the country were believed safe. Milk from the two sites will be taken to a specially designated dairy factory, where the milkfat, in which dioxin accumulates, will be skimmed off and destroyed. The remainder will be converted into powdered milk, <PERSON> Dankmeyer </PERSON> said. Meat originating from any of the stricken farms will also be destroyed, said <PERSON> Dankmeyer </PERSON>, adding that farmers will be fully compensated.

<HEAD>Summit, Bicentennial Draw Media Hordes to Paris</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Slung with I.D. tags and touting lenses worth more than the per capita income of poorer countries, 6,000 journalists descended on <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> to report on the summit of the world's seven richest nations and revel in the glamour of the French bicentennial celebrations. The summit and the media circus moved into the barely-completed <ORGANIZATION> Arche </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION>, the glittering 35-story cube that crowns the <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> business district on <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>' western edge. Camera crews relished the panorama from the 54-step climb to the marble base of the Arche, a structure that forced writers to dust off their architectural vocabulary: the consensus settled on `` post-modernist.'' Close-mouthed about the cost, the French have splashed out the hospitality for the more than 30 heads of state and the journalists who traced their every move. Open bars and four 500-seat tented pavillions at the Arche offered 23,000 lavish meals to ravenous reporters during the summit weekend. The timing of the summit _ after President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s Eastern European tour _ and the bicentennial festivities have brought out the media stars. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rather </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Brokaw </PERSON> all broadcast from famous Parisian sites. The festivities and the summit stretched logistics organizers to the limit. `` Each time we try to do smarter and better with less people,'' says <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Siegel </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, which has a team of about 50 on the mission. Like other media organizations, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> has added staff but mainly to handle the bicentennial side or the economic issues. The military parades, dance extravaganzas and the fireworks bursting over the summer crowds have provided a colorful finish to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s headline-grabbing swing through <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> network originated its Business World show from here. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s Good Morning America also broadcast a special on the bicentennial from Notre Dame cathedral, while <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> originated Today from the Quai de Tournelle. Each of the three major networks lined up top <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> adminstration officials for its Sunday morning talk shows _ Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>, national security adviser <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON> on <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> and White House Chief of Staff <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>. For a crew from <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corporation </ORGANIZATION>, the two events complement each other. `` What President -LRB- <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> was trying to do involving the summit in the bicentennial makes it more festive,'' said <PERSON> Takemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Shiga </PERSON>. `` But I think if the summit was not held in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> the bicentennial would not be so much reported.'' Some reporters grumbled about the readiness of the French for the media hordes. Crews cited delayed accreditation, the half-finished state of the Arche, which lead to power cuts and communications problems, the endless security checks and the travel arrangements between assorted press centers and hotels. Reporters traveling in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> presidential motorcade got separated from the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> limousine more than once, while other groups followed the president for seven-hour stretches without even seeing him. But the White House press room, esconced in the <ORGANIZATION> Meridien </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hotel </ORGANIZATION>, has allowed journalists from other countries and non-U.S. agencies to join expanded travel pools. `` The problems we have had here are unavoidable,'' said a <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> journalist who did not want to be named. `` Things would be simpler for foreigners who spoke even a few words of French.''

 Many haute couture shops in chic districts closed their doors in dismay at picnicking tourist crowds celebrating the bicentennial, but restaurants, cafes and bakery shops did a brisk business. Party-goers, their mouths stuffed with pastry, seemed to make a mockery of the disdainful Revolutionary era remark about letting the hungry mob eat cake. But by the wee hours of the morning Saturday, when one famished reporter was looking for nourishment, there was nothing to be found. `` Ah, Madame, we do n't have a crumb of bread left to eat,'' was the reply at one establishment. The French Revolution seemed to have come full circle.

 President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> has been accused of favoring pomp over the people for his lavish three-day bicentennial blast. But he can not be accused of nepotism. As the chief of state presided over the grand and mighty military parade marking Bastille Day, his brother, retired Gen. <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>, slipped discreetly into a vacant seat in a press stand, first wiping the dusty chair clean with a piece of paper. Asked his thoughts about his brother's alleged notions of grandeur, the general begged off. `` A big subject,'' he said in English, then added: `` I'm just a member of the public.''

 The most constant complaint during the bicentennial celebrations has come from citizens on wheels prohibited for security reasons from driving, or even parking, their cars in much of central <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. `` The French Revolution was for the abolition of privileges,'' grumbled one taxi driver angered by the inconvenience caused by more than two dozen visiting foreign leaders. `` These heads of state are nice guys and I have nothing against them,'' he said. `` But I have the right to make a living.'' In typical Gallic fashion, the taxi driver, eager to vent his emotions, expounded freely on his revolutionary heritage. But also typical, he feared identifying himself by name, saying he could lose his job if his complaints were made known. Reminded that liberty and the rights of man were at the essence of the Revolution, he gave a knowing wink. `` True. But, some people in this country have more rights than others,'' he said.

 Eight tow trucks, all honking their horns in a victory salute, tooled down the <LOCATION> Boulevard </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Montparnasse </LOCATION> the other night, dragging illegally parked cars like captured prey. French police have been unforgiving about keeping the sealed-off city center car-free to accomodate bicentennial festivities. The cars are taken to lots in the <LOCATION> Bois </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Boulogne </LOCATION> in western <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Bois </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> in the east. About 1,000 were towed in the first 24 hours of the clearing operation. The only charge to the car owner is the price of a taxi ride out.

 Reporters covering the summit of the leaders of the major industrial democracies have been treated to a tantalizing array of French food: mousses, pates, duck, roast beef, salads and tarts for dessert. The dishes are painstakingly prepared and presented on starched tablecloths. Fresh flowers abound. One day, amid the lavish culinary outlay, stood five bottles of ketchup _ apparently an attempt by the French to appeal to all their guests' tastes.

He has published three books of his poetry, one of which he gave to <PERSON> Ershad </PERSON>, according to Japanese officials. A sample of his work was published in an official biography handed out to foreign press at the summit.

 When <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Mobutu </PERSON> <PERSON> Sese </PERSON> <PERSON> Seko </PERSON> arrived to view the lavish military parade on the <LOCATION> Champs-Elysees </LOCATION> marking <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s bicentennial, they automatically strode up to the front row, befitting their place as leaders of their countries. Embarrassed French officials had to show them to their seats _ at the back of the bullet-proof stand. The seating order, the officials explained, was dictated by protocol. But how that magic formula is determined remains a mystery. The summit of the world's seven richest nations, the simultaneous meeting of some two dozen Third World leaders and the celebrations for the 200th anniversary of the French Revolution were all ruled by protocol. A <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said Saturday the seven were led by <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, the host nation, followed in order by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, Ialy and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. The spokesman said the order was determined by the years the leader had held his office. Protocol placed President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, barely six months into his term, ahead of the others because he, like <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>, is a head of state and not merely a head of government, like Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> and the rest. The official could not give any motivation for the order in which the leaders of the other 27 countries _ most of whom went home Saturday _ were ranked. Protocol was invented by the French before the French Revolution as a set of rules for the behavior of diplomats. As host, French President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> was able to use protocol to get his message across, putting emphasis where he felt it was due and, perhaps, putting world leaders such as <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> in their place. As master of ceremonies, <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> was able to control events, from how the heads of government lined up for the official photograph to the order in which they made their getaways by limousine. <PERSON> Mobutu </PERSON>, who was not invited but came anyway, is on the French government's blacklist for his checkered human rights record. Wearing his trademark leopard skin cap, <PERSON> Mobutu </PERSON> strode to the front row of every meeting, only to find he was seated inconspicuously at the back. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> was booed by the French public Friday for recalling the `` incredible terror'' of their hallowed revolution and likening it to latter day exterminations in communist lands. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> had a place of honor on <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>'s left in the formal group photo taken of the seven; <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was on his right. `` We could not do anything else, since she was the only lady among the leaders,'' a <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman explained. But at the inauguration of the new opera house at the <LOCATION> Bastille </LOCATION>, Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> found she had to take a back seat with <PERSON> Mobutu </PERSON>, while <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was in front, alongside <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON>. At Friday's military parade, the <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> prime minister was among the last allowed to leave the bulletproof enclosure encircling the leaders. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s Uno was also in the rear guard. <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> and his motocycle escort left first, as is the custom for the host. But the arrangements for the others had not been made clear in advance. So, for several minutes, the leaders sat on their red velvet chairs not daring to move for fear of _ what else? _ upsetting protocol. When the order of departure was finally sorted out, President <PERSON> Felix </PERSON> <PERSON> Houphouet-Boigny </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Ivory </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>, a leader of the underprivileged countries, was first out of the gate, followed swiftly by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. In the confusion, the leaders' cars got out of order and some almost collided. President <PERSON> Omar </PERSON> <PERSON> Bongo </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Gabon </LOCATION> decided to return to his hotel on foot. <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> was unable to win approval of his idea for a North-South summit of the nation's rich and poor countries. But he was able to ensure that the leaders of the poor nations had plenty of opportunities to mix and mingle with the presidents and prime ministers of the mighty seven. He threw them together at every opportunity.

 A <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION> tanker carrying 16.5 million gallons of crude oil ran aground 10 miles south of here, but there was no oil leakage or damage to the vessel's hull, a <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said Saturday. The 785-foot tanker, the <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hal </PERSON> <PERSON> Dean </PERSON>, became stuck in mud about 6 p.m Friday and was refloated by 10:15 a.m. Saturday, said Cmdr. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Gormanson </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> office in Mobile, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>. Five tugboats were used `` Beginning about 4:30 a.m., they took 125,000 barrels off the vessel to raise the vessel from the mud,'' <PERSON> Gormanson </PERSON> said. `` No spill was noted.'' `` We know of no oil in the water,'' said <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Shanks </PERSON>, manager of operations at <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Pascagoula </LOCATION> refinery. The tanker had been en route to the refinery when it ran aground near the junction of the <LOCATION> Pascagoula </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Horn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> channels. The <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> closed a channel while crews refloated the vessel. The tanker continued on to the refinery after being refloated.

The <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hal </PERSON> <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> is a `` lightering vessel,'' which off-loads supertankers in the Gulf and carries the crude oil to port, <PERSON> Shanks </PERSON> said.

 Gunfire rang through <LOCATION> Somalia </LOCATION>'s capital on Saturday for a second straight day, residents said, and police increased the death toll to 23 from clashes between security forces and religious demonstrators. Police said 59 people were wounded in Friday's clashes in <LOCATION> Somalia </LOCATION>'s capital, <LOCATION> Mogadishu </LOCATION>, when security forces opened fire on what the government termed `` troublemakers hiding behind the banner of religion.'' It was unclear what caused the violence. The government Friday gave the death toll as 10. It did not explain why the casualty count was increased Saturday. In <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> summoned the ambassador from <LOCATION> Somalia </LOCATION> on Saturday to express its concern about the lives of Italians in the country. The ministry also said a military plane had flown from <LOCATION> Mogadishu </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Nairobi </LOCATION> on Saturday with about 40 Italians who asked to leave <LOCATION> Somalia </LOCATION>. Residents, who spoke by telephone, said shots were heard periodically around the East African capital Saturday but that the shooting lacked the intensity of Friday's clashes. The residents, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the city was otherwise calm and that authorities lifted a 6 p.m-6 a.m. curfew. Somali President <PERSON> Mohamed </PERSON> <PERSON> Siad </PERSON> <PERSON> Barre </PERSON>, in a statement broadcast over state radio and monitored in <LOCATION> Nairobi </LOCATION>, offered his condolences to the relatives of victims and said the clashes were over and `` things were back to normal.'' The government said Friday that security forces opened fire after religious demonstrators attacked them with stones, knives and sticks. A resident contacted by telephone Friday said it appeared troops had opened fire as Moslem worshipers left their place of prayer. Islam is the state religion in the overwhelmingly pastoral, impoverished nation of about 9 million. Friday is normally the Moslem Sabbath, but July 14 also was the occasion for feast and celebration of the hajj, the Moslem pilgrimage to the holy city of <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION>. There were reports during the week that several Moslem religious leaders and other prominent citizens had been detained by authorities, but it was not known whether the reported arrests were related to the clashes. On July 9, a gunman killed <PERSON> Mogadishu </PERSON>'s Roman Catholic bishop, <PERSON> Salvatore </PERSON> <PERSON> Pietro </PERSON> <PERSON> Colombo </PERSON>. It was not known whether the disturbances were connected to that incident. There are an estimated 2,000 Roman Catholics in <LOCATION> Somalia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Siad </PERSON> <PERSON> Barre </PERSON>, who has ruled since 1969, has not allowed journalists to visit for more than a year. Since 1981, <LOCATION> Somalia </LOCATION> has battled the <ORGANIZATION> Somali </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>, which demands <PERSON> Barre </PERSON>'s removal. Intensified fighting in the last 18 months has driven more than 200,000 Somalis into refugee camps in neighboring <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>.

 Masked Palestinians on Saturday reportedly killed an Arab suspected of collaborating with <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> authorities, and police concluded that the slaying of an elderly <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> man was tied to the uprising. The army imposed curfews on the Nur-Shams refugee camp near the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> and on several refugee camps and villages in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. Nine Palestinians were reported wounded in scattered clashes with <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers in the occupied lands. In <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, four Arabs were injured in Israeli stone-throwing attacks, the national news agency <ORGANIZATION> Itim </ORGANIZATION> said. In <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Qalqilya </LOCATION>, masked Palestinians broke into the house of <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Yusef </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Khader </PERSON>, 60, accused him of collaborating with <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> officials and fatally stabbed him, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> journalists and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said. The death brought to 564 the number of Palestinians killed in the 19-month uprising against <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> rule in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. Most victims died in army gunfire, but more than 70 have been killed by Palestinians who accused them of being collaborators. Police said that two 16-year-old Palestinians confessed to murdering <PERSON> Zalman </PERSON> <PERSON> Yosef </PERSON> <PERSON> Schlein </PERSON>, 64, in the southern Israeli town of <LOCATION> Gan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yavne </LOCATION> on Friday. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said one of the teen-agers stabbed the elderly Jewish man while the other hit him on the head with an iron bar. Initial reports had said <PERSON> Schlein </PERSON> was slain in a dispute over money. But <PERSON> Uzi </PERSON> <PERSON> Sandouri </PERSON>, spokesman for the southern police district, said the murder was `` a premeditated nationalist killing.'' <PERSON> Sandouri </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> the two suspects, whose names were not released, were members of an underground group in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s Shajaiya quarter <PERSON> Schlein </PERSON>'s death brought to 36 the number of Israelis slain in the uprising. Most of them were civilians. Arab hospital officials said a clash with soldiers left two <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> teen-agers from Nur-Shams injured, one with serious gunshot wounds to the chest and stomach. In <LOCATION> Tulkarem </LOCATION> refugee camp, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers shot and wounded an 8-year-old boy in the thigh with a plastic bullet, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> doctors said. In the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, the army ordered all male residents of <LOCATION> Beit </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hanoun </LOCATION> aged 15 to 50 to gather at a local agricultural school while the village was placed under curfew, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said. Youths who ran away from the village told <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> journalists soldiers checked the residents' identity cards against computerized lists and arrested at least 50 suspected ringleaders. The military command said it was checking the report. At least six Palestinians were shot and wounded in clashes with troops in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>'s Jabaliya and <LOCATION> Rafah </LOCATION> refugee camps, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> hospital officials said.

<HEAD>Fire Season Simmers After Two Week Send-off</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOISE, Idaho (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 After a frenzied two weeks to kick off the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>'s wildfire season, activity scaled back to a simmer by week's end at the federal <ORGANIZATION> Boise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interagency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> But old hands at the national command post know the slack is only a lull between storms _ a chance to sharpen shovels, restock supplies and rest before the next onslaught. High-tech sensors to detect lightning strikes offer clues, but where fires will rage is beyond even the center's experts in firefighting tactics, manpower allocation, weather forecasting and logistics. `` All we can say for sure is conditions remain hot and dry. The rest is up to <PERSON> Mother </PERSON> <PERSON> Nature </PERSON>,'' said spokesman <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartigan </PERSON>. `` We are far from being out of the fire season yet.'' The <LOCATION> Boise </LOCATION> center is the federal government's logistics and support nerve center for firefighting activities across <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. There were 33,388 fires reported nationwide to the <LOCATION> Boise </LOCATION> center through Thursday. That was well below the 56,489 reported through July 13 last year, when blazes across the northern Rockies were beginning to spread rapidly through drought-parched brush and timber. Almost 6 million acres were burned last year, including more than 1 million acres of <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION>, where flames changed the famous landscape for generations. Federal agencies spent almost $ 584 million on firefighting. This year's fires, although not as numerous, are bigger. Nationwide, they had burned almost 130,000 acres more through Thursday than the 1.1 million acres blackened by the same time in 1988. Officials say the reasons include large spring blazes in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Southwest </LOCATION>, barely accessible terrain and plentiful, well-cured fuel after a number of years without fires in this season's hot spots. The 1989 fires also are further south. The focus of fire activity last summer was <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> and northern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. This year it's <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. `` It's where the drought is,'' <PERSON> Hartigan </PERSON> said. `` The pattern has shifted southwest. But I'd have to say that almost all of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>, with very few exceptions, is still not entirely recovered from four years of drought.'' As far east as <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>, where the impact of drought is more often seen in withering corn fields, fire is taking its toll. But overall, the first assault of the 1989 fire season still pales in comparison with the memory of 1988. About 12,500 firefighters were in the field at the height of activity last week. There were about 30,000 during the first week of September last year, including 5,600 Army and Marine troops. <PERSON> Hartigan </PERSON> said the help provided by those crews, primarily at <LOCATION> Yellowstone </LOCATION>, gave fire bosses an extra tool they hope will be unnecessary this summer. `` What we learned is military troops are physically fit, they're disciplined and we can train them to do what we need to do in just a couple of days,'' he said `` We're not anticipating the need for that, but we want to be prepared.''

<HEAD>White House Raises Possibility of Breakthrough in Mexico Debt Talks</HEAD>

 <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, test case for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>' new strategy to ease the foreign debt problem, may clinch a deal shortly with bankers to trim its $ 100 billion loan portfolio, a White House official said Saturday. `` It is in the dotting the ` i' and crossing the ` t' stage on some of the tough details that are important both of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and the banks,'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> told reporters. <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s chief of staff, raised the possibility of an agreement by Sunday's conclusion of the economic summit of the seven major industrialized nations in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and other officials want an early end to the talks with <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> to prove the viability of its new approach on the $ 1.3 trillion debt of developing nations. The strategy, marking a sharp turn in American policy, emphasizes debt forgiveness or reduction for the poorer nations. Finance ministers taking part in the summit from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> called on commercial banks to play their part in the latest debt plan. `` We felt the banks should get on with the negotiations,'' said <LOCATION> Canadian </LOCATION> Finance Minister <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>. `` We feel the resources that are in place are adequate to do the job.'' <PERSON> Toyoo </PERSON> <PERSON> Gyoten </PERSON>, deputy Japanese finance minister, said, `` The main thrust was we have to continue to put the wind in the sails -LRB- of bankers -RRB- and keep it moving.'' In supporting the current approach, the officials turned aside fresh pleas for more help from leaders of poorer nations, who were in town to mark Friday's 200th anniversary of the French revolution. In their economic talks, summit participants were generally upbeat about the economic outlook but warned of the threat posed by rising inflation in some countries. `` There's no recession talk at all,'' said <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>. `` There's no country who saw a recession on the horizon or the possibility of a recession on the horizon.'' But, he said, `` Inflation is a problem we must continue to deal with, that we must continue to be vigilant on.'' The officials also stressed the importance of correcting the budget and trade imbalances run up by some countries. They urged countries to make sure the current round of trade liberalization end on a successful note by their scheduled 1990 deadline. The talks, under the auspices of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, have been hampered by disputes over agricultural subsidies and other issues. The 96-nation <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> is a forum and arrangement to promote free world trade. Much of the attention of the economic discussions has been focused on <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s debt negotiations. <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> is the developing world's No. 2 debtor, behind <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>. It has often taken the lead in finding new ways to ease the debt load. <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>, showing his thumb and index finger nearly touching, said <LOCATION> Mexican </LOCATION> officials and private bankers `` are now about that far apart.'' He said another bargaining session was expected `` in the next 24 hours or so. And it is hoped that at that meeting substantially most of, if not all, of that gap will be closed.'' <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> also said the debt talks were `` pretty close.'' He said a Mexican deal could `` clearly be an incentive to other countries'' to make economic changes required for participation in the rich countries' debt plan. It calls for debtor nations to cut inflation rates, strengthen their currencies and take other steps to regain their economic health. Treasury Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> said Friday the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was willing to work with the other industrialized nations to arrange a $ 1 billion to $ 2 billion emergency loan to help <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> meet its obligations while it negotiates with private bankers for a new debt accord. <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> owes private lenders $ 54 billion, with about $ 15 billion due American banks. In its negotiations with bankers, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> wants to slash both its overall debt and the amount of its annual interest payments, which run about $ 10 billion a year. Both sides have tentatively agreed on a 35 percent discount that would mean savings to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> of about $ 3 billion in annual debt payments, according to sources who demanded anonymity.

<UNK>Wealthy Seven to Ship Surpluses to Food-Short Poland ^By CAROL J.

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> will receive massive shipments of foodstuffs in a campaign approved Saturday by leaders of the seven wealthiest democracies in recognition of <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>'s efforts at reform. Officials say the foodlift, the first definitive action endorsed Saturday by the economic summit, could start within two weeks. The leaders of the seven nations also will convene an international conference within a few weeks to coordinate aid to <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. The food aid is the first joint gesture by the world's wealthiest democracies toward a socialist country in response to its reform movement, though several Western nations have already forgiven or rescheduled hard-currency debts to ease <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>'s financial burdens. Polish leader Gen. <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> had appealed to the <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> summit leaders to take immediate action to prevent a worsening of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s economic crisis, and suggested food credits and debt rescheduling as ways of lessening the burden. European nations are currently warehousing surplus stocks of meat, sugar, grain and some dairy products that could ease the crisis and diversify the diets of Poles afflicted by bad harvests and a cumbersome distribution system. <PERSON> Claus </PERSON> <PERSON> Ehlermann </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>, said officials within his organization took the summit statement on food aid for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> as a mandate to take stock of the specific items available, what is needed by the Poles and to determine what other governments outside the 12-nation community might be willing to contribute. `` The food aid coordination will move very quickly, maybe as soon as next week,'' <PERSON> Ehlermann </PERSON> said. Asked how long it would take to actually deliver food to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Ehlermann </PERSON> said the relief effort could be under way within two weeks. He pointed out the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION>'s experience in orchestrating urgent aid to <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> in past years. `` We're not sure what volume they have in mind,'' the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said of the summit initiative. <PERSON> Ehlermann </PERSON> said grain and meat are in good supply in <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> surplus warehouses, but that milk powder and butter were insufficient to meet a huge demand. At the urging of West German Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>, the seven leaders included in their political communique the call for urgent action to supply Poles with foods in chronic shortage there. At President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s behest, the statement broadened the planned effort to `` concerted effort for reform'' across the board. And the conference was opened to `` all interested countries,'' rather than simply the seven-nation family of the summit participants. `` In my opinion, at least since the visit of President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, we see a more positive approach by the seven to help these countries help themselves,'' observed West German <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Hanns </PERSON> <PERSON> Schumacher </PERSON>. `` There had previously been a lot of mistrust of the German position.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> visited those countries en route to <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> and praised the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> governments for their efforts toward an improved world political climate and protection of human rights.

<HEAD>Four Soldiers Killed In Clash Between Indian, Sri Lankan Troops</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A soldier in <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> mistook <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> peacekeeping troops for rebels and opened fire, sparking a gunbattle that killed two Sri Lankan soldiers and two Indian soldiers, an Indian government spokesman said Saturday. The clash Friday was the first of its kind since Indian troops were sent to <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> nearly two years ago to quell the civil war, but the spokesman called the gunbattle an accident and said both countries considered the matter closed. The Sri Lankan soldier fired on an Indian patrol of about 20 soldiers passing a remote jungle camp at 3 a.m. Friday, setting off a brief firefight, said the spokesman, who commented on condition of anonymity. The shooting occurred near <LOCATION> Akbopana </LOCATION>, about 130 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>, the Sri Lankan capital. Relations between the two governments have grown increasingly prickly in recent weeks since Sri Lankan President <PERSON> Ranasinghe </PERSON> <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON> demanded that <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> withdraw its peacekeeping force by July 29. The exchange of fire between the two sides `` lasted for a short while. It was stopped when the mistake was realized,'' the government spokesman said. `` It was decided to treat the matter as closed and not to publicize it,'' he added. <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON>'s government has enforced censorship in <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> since July 6. `` Two Indian soldiers were killed and five were wounded. On the Sri Lankan side, two reportedly were killed and a few wounded,'' the Indian government spokesman said. Another source, speaking on condition he was not identified further, said two Sri Lankans were confirmed dead. Sri Lankan Tamil guerrillas, who have attacked both Sri Lankan and Indian soldiers, sometimes wear military-style uniforms and have been known to travel in stolen military vehicles. The Indian spokesman said the Indian soldiers were on foot. However, this seemed unlikely _ especially at in the dark _ because of the danger of guerrilla ambushes and leopard attacks. The Indian peacekeeping force was dispatched to <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> on July 30, 1987, after <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> signed an accord designed to end the war by Tamil guerrillas fighting for an independent homeland. Tamils comprise 18 percent of <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s 16 million people and say they are discriminated against by the Sinhalese-dominated government. Sinhalese make up 75 percent of the population. <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> became involved in the internal affairs of its small neighbor because of its role as the region's chief power and the political clout of its own Tamil minority of 60 million.

 Singer <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> lost a paternity suit filed by a 27-year-old woman who spent three nights with him at a <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> hotel two years ago, her lawyer said Saturday. A Family Court judge ruled Friday that <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> fathered 1-year-old <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> <PERSON> Berkery </PERSON>, who was born to <PERSON> Katherine </PERSON> <PERSON> Berkery </PERSON> on June 27, 1988, said <PERSON> Raoul </PERSON> <PERSON> Felder </PERSON>, Ms. <PERSON> Berkery </PERSON>'s attorney. Judge <PERSON> Judith </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheindlin </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Manhattan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Family </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ordered <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, 48, to pay a weekly sum of $ 200 to Ms. <PERSON> Berkery </PERSON> for the maintenance of the child, <PERSON> Felder </PERSON> said. When the ruling was made, Ms. <PERSON> Berkery </PERSON> was crying, <PERSON> Felder </PERSON> said. `` The baby was in the court and she said to the baby, ` Now, you have a father.''' The judge set a court hearing for Sept. 5 to hear the lawyer's request for a larger monthly sum for his client A message left at the <LOCATION> White </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION> home of one of <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>' lawyers was not immediately returned. There was no answer at the <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> law office of another attorney representing the singer. <PERSON> Felder </PERSON> said the judge's ruling was based on his client's testimony and a blood and tissue test that showed there was a 99.76 percent degree of probability that <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> was the boy's father He noted that <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, who has a <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> wife, `` never showed up in court to explain or deny'' that the child was his.

 Harmony and reverence for human rights echoed Saturday from the summit document adopted by leaders of seven democracies in a windowless room on the 35th floor of the Grand Arch, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s newest national symbol. On the bicentennial of the French Revolution, it was only natural that President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and his six partners reaffirmed their commitment to freedom and democratic principles even as they pointedly urged <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> to cease its repression of pro-democracy forces. But facing no immediate threats to their security or their economies, the summiteers issued a mild communique. It thundered at terrorists without identifying their supporters. It skirted the oppressive hunger of the undernourished Third World. And it pledged no cold cash for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> to smooth the transition of the two Soviet bloc countries to free market economies. Even before the leaders opened their deliberations Friday evening at a lavish dinner of stuffed lobster and lamb, washed down with Chateau Montrose 1918, a tentative <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> proposal to create a `` clearinghouse'' for aid to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> was jettisoned. At the last minute, West German Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>, working in tandem with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, won approval for a conference of `` all interested countries'' later this summer to consider <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s urgent food problems and `` concerted support for reform'' in the two countries. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> paved the way with letters to his summit partners before he came to <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. For now, Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> told reporters, the site, agenda and participants in the aid-for-Poland conference have not been determined. French President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>, a Socialist host presiding over a gathering of largely conservative leaders, found no support for his proposal to set up an international conference with poor countries to consider ways to ease their staggering $ 1.3 trillion debt. <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> had to abandon the idea. With some two dozen heads of Third World countries here as bicentennial guests, the communique offered hopeful rhetoric _ but, as expected, not much else. The section on <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> called on the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> to postpone new loans as a way of registering `` our deep sense of condemnation'' over <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s repressive measures. Also, Chinese students apprehensive about returning home were assured they could stay indefinitely in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. No sanctions were recommended, an apparent ratification of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s policy of taking a measured approach to events in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said the President had taken the lead on the subject at the summit. `` We look to the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> authorities to create conditions which will avoid their isolation and provide for a return to cooperation based upon the resumption of movement towards political and economic reform and openness,'' the communique said with a diplomatic lack of directness. And while the seven leaders encouraged `` greater freedom and democracy'' in Central and <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, they evinced no sign of fervor or immediate aid to match <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> incentives of $ 115 million and $ 25 million that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> extended to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> during his visits there. Even so, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> was pleased with the overall results. He said the leaders got along so well they may be able to conclude their deliberations ahead of schedule on Sunday. Having attended nine summits as White House chief of staff, <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> secretary and now secretary of <ORGANIZATION> state </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said this was `` the most harmonious and one of the most productive summits that I have attended.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, after breakfast Saturday with <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, dismissed the absence of specific aid commitments from his summit partners. `` There have been some misconceptions we would come in here with a dollar package,'' the president said. `` I managed to convey in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> that that was not the case and here it is not the case.'' He said the communique `` vindicated'' his approach. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> said, meanwhile, `` We are all very anxious to help. We are all helping, each in our own way.''

 Mediators from the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> said Saturday that the government and opposition leaders have agreed to hold talks to resolve <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s political crisis. A statement by the mission from the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> States </ORGANIZATION> said the talks were scheduled to begin Sunday `` without an agenda, without preconditions and with the commitment that no topic would be excluded.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> will send representatives to the talks as part of the government delegation, the statement said. The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> chief, Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, is the nation's de factor leader and is under pressure to quit. Up to now, the position of the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> and the government has been that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s situation was not subject to discussion. Saturday's announcement `` that no topic would be excluded'' seemed to indicate a change of attitude. It will be the first time that the Defense Forces, government and opposition have held talks. The <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> delegation arrived Saturday on its third mediation visit since <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s regime annulled an election May 7 that international observers say opposition candidates won by a landslide. <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION>'s Foreign Minister <PERSON> Diego </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordovez </PERSON> is heading the mission, which includes foreign ministers <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Palencia </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Sadeo </PERSON> <PERSON> Badseo </PERSON> of Trinidad-Tobago, and <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Joao </PERSON> <PERSON> Baena </PERSON> <PERSON> Soares </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>.

 As leaders of the world's seven richest industrial nations huddled Saturday to discuss global warming, pollution and other threats to the planet earth, environmentalists challenged them to turn their talk into action. `` Rhetoric is terrific, discussions are great, but we feel it's time for specific commitments,'' said <PERSON> Rafe </PERSON> <PERSON> Pomerance </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> The summit leaders have already made the environment a cornerstone of their 15th annual economic summit. They addressed the issue in passing in the political communique issued earlier Saturday. `` We see good opportunities for the countries of West and East to work together ... to safeguard the resources and the environment,'' the leaders declared. One-third of the final communique was expected to cover the environment, a reflection of the growing sentiment around the world for a solution to the world's pollution problems. During their discussions Saturday, <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> told her colleagues: `` No generation has a freehold on this earth. All we have is a life tenancy with a full repairing lease.'' A British spokesman, who relayed Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s comments, said there was general consensus among the summit partners that environmental problems should be attacked through existing international institutions, including the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Environmental Program, the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Meteorological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> and other <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> agencies on climate changes. A Canadian official said West German Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> was `` particularly firm'' in insisting that tropical rain forests be given urgent attention. The official, who briefed reporters on condition he not be identified, said Canadian Prime Minister <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> said the communique should express the need for a barometer or yardstick to measure the environment costs caused by economic development. According to the British spokesman, who also requested anonymity, Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> said `` the guiding philosophy should be recognition of the principle that environmentally senstive development is both possible and essential.'' The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration views the environment as an area in which the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> can provide the leadership. `` This is the 15th summit of the leaders of the seven countries here,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON>, administrator of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. `` None has ever come close to paying the attention to the environment that this one has.'' Among the items on the table: air and water pollution, including acid rain, oil spills and damage to the ozone layer from chloroflurocarbons in the upper atmosphere, a problem that <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> said could lead to the `` potential destablilization of the planet.'' `` On all of these issues, we see that there is an emerging consensus on the part of the leaders of the governments represented here ... that these issues are significant, important, are worthy of concern at the very highest levels of government,'' <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> said. But he said no formal agreement on a course of action was expected when the final summit communique is released Sunday. `` It's not the function ... of governments to come together at summits and set out specific measures to reduce, for example, the unemployment rate or the rate of inflation,'' he said. `` Rather, the point of summit conversations is to identify problems, determine general categories of priority, give a degree of consensus, if that exists, identifying, sometimes, areas of disagreement that have to be resolved,'' said <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON>. `` That is what's happening on the environment.'' The final communique is likely to express little beyond a unified call among the industrial powers for decisive action by all nations as well as a reiteration of concern about depletion of the ozone layer, ocean pollution, dirty urban air and the need for a `` framework'' agreement that may eventually lead to a multinational treaty on global warming. That is n't enough for environmentalists. `` Diplomacy is great, but it's got to run according to the atmosphere's timetable, not political leaders','' <PERSON> Pomerance </PERSON> told reporters. `` We wish that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would come with a proposal to make a 20 percent reduction in carbon dioxide emissions by the end of this century,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON>, legislative director of the <ORGANIZATION> Sierra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON> said it appeared that neither <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> nor <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> had `` brought such a proposal to this summit. And that's a major disappointment to us.'' <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> was pushing a proposal to convert Third World debt into a fund for protection of endangered tropical rain forests. But that idea has generated a lukewarm response from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and appeared to have little chance for success. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, in a statement of its `` major contributions'' to the summit, outlined its plan to give developing countries $ 2.25 billion over three years for projects to improve the environment. It said it will send a mission to <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> to determine how to attack the problems on a global level.

 A pilot told investigators Saturday he did n't know how he was shot and has no recollection of his 800-mile, apparently unconscious flight down the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> in his small plane, officials said. Federal investigators talked to <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Root </PERSON> in his hospital room for the first time since the lawyer was rescued Thursday in Bahamian waters where his single-engine plane crashed. Afterward, authorities learned Root had been shot. Root told a federal air safety investigator in a 40-minute interview that he did not recall the shooting. He was interviewed separately by an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent. `` We have no reason to disbelieve him at this point. We have some questions. There are some inconsistencies,'' said <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Alston </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>. `` He does n't remember a gunshot wound and we see one. That is a large inconsistency that we hope to resolve.'' Root, a gun collector, told <PERSON> Alston </PERSON> that he kept a loaded .32 - caliber <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Wesson </ORGANIZATION> revolver in the glove compartment of his Root said he does n't remember anything after a radio conversation in which he reported having difficulty breathing, the <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> investigator said. Root's plane ran out of gas and crashed about four hours later. `` His statement to me was indicative of an oxygen deprivation situation,'' <PERSON> Alston </PERSON> said. `` The next thing he remembered was waking up and seeing water coming through and around the windshield.'' <PERSON> Alston </PERSON> said officials will conduct further tests, including checking for carbon monoxide in a blood sample, and talk to the gun manufacturer about possible causes of the shooting. Root was in stable condition at Memorial Hospital in <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>, north of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. He had been under heavy sedation Friday. `` It's an odd story all right,'' Root's brother-in-law, <PERSON> Brett </PERSON> <PERSON> Geer </PERSON>, said after a visit Friday. `` With this wound and him not being able to recollect how he got it, I'm sure there is reason for an investigation.'' `` Even though there are a lot of unanswered questions, the one thing we are certain of is that he did not make any attempt on his life,'' said brother <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Todd </PERSON> <PERSON> Root </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Burlingame </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>. Root underwent surgery at the hospital Thursday night `` He's a very lucky guy,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, who operated on Root. `` I do n't know if he wanted to be lucky. We'll find out sooner or later.'' Root, 36, of <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, apparently became unconscious while piloting his <ORGANIZATION> Cessna </ORGANIZATION> from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> National </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Rocky </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C </LOCATION>. The plane was on autopilot and military pilots shadowed his aircraft for nearly four hours. The plane ran out of gas and crashed in mile-deep waters 14 miles west of the <LOCATION> Bahamian </LOCATION> island of <LOCATION> Eleuthera </LOCATION>. Root swam to a raft, where rescuers pulled him to safety. <PERSON> Geer </PERSON> said <PERSON> Root </PERSON> told him the bullet wound was not self-inflicted and could have occurred when the impact of the crash triggered the pistol. On Friday, a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> official said authorities found 35 guns, many of them loaded, in a search of Root's plane last April at the <LOCATION> Manassas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. All of the guns were legal under federal law, and all but one under state law, which led to a state misdemeanor charge. The arsenal included assault-style rifles and three .357 - caliber Magnum In <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, Secretary of State <PERSON> Rufus </PERSON> <PERSON> Edmisten </PERSON> said his office has been investigating security fraud allegations against a company with which Root acted as an attorney. <PERSON> Edmisten </PERSON> said the lawyer knew he was under investigation.

<HEAD>Finance Ministers Agree To Set Up Task Force On Money Laundering</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Finance ministers of the seven major industrial nations agreed Saturday to set up an international task force to trace laundered drug money. Japanese Deputy Finance Minister <PERSON> Toyoo </PERSON> <PERSON> Gyoten </PERSON> said the ministers expressed grave concern that such laundering eventually `` will really undermine the credibility of the financial systems.'' The ministers spoke of the problem during talks organized as part of the seven-nation <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> summit ending Sunday. A British spokesman, who asked not to be identified, said the task force would `` presumably'' operate under the aegis of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Settlements </ORGANIZATION>, and the 24-nation <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cooperation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Gyoten </PERSON> told reporters, `` There was a clear understanding, an agreement that efforts should be strengthened to prevent the utilization of banks and other financial institutions for the purpose of money-laundering.'' Canadian Foreign Minister <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said the drug problem was a dominant topic among the heads of state at dinner Friday night and lunch Saturday. `` There is a general sense this is a major international problem to which the response is not adequate, that there needs to be more imagination and effectiveness in devising a more effective response both to the demand problem and source problem,'' <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> told a news conference. Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> outlined at Saturday's afternoon session her plan to hold an international conference in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> this fall on ways of curbing demand for drugs, primarily through educational programs. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> regards damping down demand as a key complement to pressure from industrialized countries on Third World nations to curb the production of drugs, particularly cocaine and crack.

 Leftist guerrillas attacked one of the largest state-owned mines in the country, destroying machinery and forcing suspension of operations for six months, police said Saturday. Two mine workers were reported wounded. About 100 guerrillas from the leftist <ORGANIZATION> Shining </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Path </ORGANIZATION> group attacked the <ORGANIZATION> Morococha </ORGANIZATION> mine Friday, setting off dynamite that destroyed mining machinery, fuel tanks, electrical generators and electronic control panels, police said. The mine, owned by the state mining company Centromin-Peru, produces copper, lead, zinc and silver. It is located in the <LOCATION> Andean </LOCATION> highlands 70 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION> at more than 13,000 feet above sea level in the department of <LOCATION> Junin </LOCATION>. Police in <LOCATION> Huancayo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Junin </LOCATION>'s capital, said the guerrillas first attacked the police station of <ORGANIZATION> Morococha </ORGANIZATION> with dynamite to prevent officers from reaching the mine. Two mine workers who tried to repel the attack on the mine were seriously wounded, the police said. Centromin-Peru employs about 17,000 miners, 3,000 of them at the <ORGANIZATION> Morococha </ORGANIZATION> mine. The company brings in about $ 300 million a year to this impoverished nation. The Shining Path has been battling <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s elected government since 1980. The government says more than 15,000 people have died in the war. Mining companies have been asking officials for more protection against terrorist attacks. Rebel groups often target the isolated mining camps to hinder production and steal dynamite, food and medicine.

 Local Communist Party officials and mine executives have joined strikes in the <LOCATION> Kuzbass </LOCATION> coal region of western <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION> to protest centralized control over the industry, Soviet newspapers reported Saturday. Officials from the <ORGANIZATION> Mining </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> and regional party committees appealed to miners in at least nine cities to return to work, according to dispatches from <LOCATION> Kuzbass </LOCATION>, one of the country's most important coal-producing regions. Newspapers described a chaotic situation in <LOCATION> Kuzbass </LOCATION>, which is about 2,560 miles east of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. The situation has developed into a battle by miners and mine executives to wrest control from the Moscow-based ministry, the newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Sovietskaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rossia </ORGANIZATION> said. The miners want authority to set production levels and improve working conditions and such amenities as housing, schools and food, it said. `` Strike committees have formed in the mines,'' <ORGANIZATION> Sovietskaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rossia </ORGANIZATION> reported. `` Most of the people in authority have joined them. That includes many communists, trade union representatives and party secretaries.'' Tens of thousands of miners met Saturday night with Mining Minister <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shchadov </PERSON> on the central square of <LOCATION> Prokopevsk </LOCATION>, about 1,600 miles east of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, according to <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> and a local mine official. `` The minister is promising help,'' said <PERSON> Yevgeny </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Koslov </PERSON>, an assistant mine surveyor in <LOCATION> Prokopevsk </LOCATION>. `` They are having a dialogue.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Socialisticheskaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industria </ORGANIZATION> said two mining executives who joined the strikes were <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Naidov </PERSON>, head of a group of mines in the town of <LOCATION> Prokopevsk </LOCATION>, and I.A. <PERSON> Khamin </PERSON>, director of the Baidayevsky Mine in an unidentified town. `` Independence is just not possible,'' <PERSON> Naidov </PERSON> said, because Moscow-based ministries make up to 90 percent of economic decisions affecting local enterprises and governments. `` They say, ` You just mine the coal, and we will guarantee the rest,'' <ORGANIZATION> Socialisticheskaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industria </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Naidov </PERSON> as saying. `` But people do not have what they were guaranteed. People have nothing worthwhile, no housing, no food, no leisure facilities,'' said <PERSON> Naidov </PERSON>. `` This is intolerable. It is not the mine but the individual who should be the master. The essence of the protest is this: We want to work more effectively,'' he was quoted as saying. Strikes have been spreading throughout <LOCATION> Kuzbass </LOCATION>, despite settlements reported with miners in two cities, <LOCATION> Osiniki </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mezhdurechensk </LOCATION>, where the strikes began Monday. Authorities had reported an end to the strike Thursday, but miners then expanded their agenda from economic issues, such as food, housing and health care, to broader demands for political change. The government newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION>, however, said the strikes spread because no one explained to residents of the region that the settlement in <LOCATION> Mezhdurechensk </LOCATION> applied to the entire area. On Saturday, thousands of miners and their families held protest rallies in towns throughout the region, newspapers reported. The crisis was the worst in <LOCATION> Prokopevsk </LOCATION>, where production was virtually halted, <ORGANIZATION> Socialisticheskaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industria </ORGANIZATION> reported. `` Events in the <LOCATION> Kuzbass </LOCATION> have taken a sharp turn,'' the newspaper said. Although miners returned to work in <LOCATION> Mezhdurechensk </LOCATION>, in other mining towns in the `` the situation has sharply intensified.'' Published reports said miners were striking in nine cities, including <LOCATION> Prokopevsk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Novokuznetsk </LOCATION>, Kisilevsk, Lenin-Kuznets, and <PERSON> Kemerevo </PERSON>. It was not clear where the other strikes were going on. None of the reports estimated the number of strikers. An administrator at one of the mines in <LOCATION> Mezhdurechensk </LOCATION> said all the miners there had returned to work, but he refused to estimate the number of mines or miners involved regionwide. `` We never had strikes like this before. Never,'' said the administrator, who spoke in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and refused to give his name. Miners in <LOCATION> Byelov </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Anzhero-Sudzhesk </PERSON> continued to work but still made demands on authorities, the reports said. The reports said, however, that strike committees were keeping social order. `` At their demand, sales of liquor were stopped and narcotics control points were established along highways,'' Pravda reported. But the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> newspaper had harsh words for the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, a small but widespread group of activists who seek legalization of multiple political parties. `` Efforts were made by the so-called ` <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>' and several other informal organizations to spread anti-Soviet slogans, but they received a resolute rebuff'' in two cities, the newspaper said. Authorities throughout the region tried to talk the miners back to work. `` Democracy means not only rights, but also responsibility, discipline and organization,'' <ORGANIZATION> Socialisticheskaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industria </ORGANIZATION> warned.

 A sculpture of a nude woman at the <ORGANIZATION> Arkansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> is being kept under wraps when children visit because the director does n't want their teen-age guides to be embarrassed. <PERSON> Townsend </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolfe </PERSON>, director of the center, said he strongly opposes censorship, but volunteered to drape the work by sculptor <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> DeAndrea </PERSON> when children under 12 tour the center's Rockefeller Gallery. `` These young children come in with part-time teen-age leaders. They might turn around and walk out and never come back again,'' said <PERSON> Wolfe </PERSON>. `` I do n't understand the controversy. We've got much stronger nude pictures hanging currently, and have had,'' said <PERSON> Wolfe </PERSON>. An exhibit showing a couple making love was on display uneventfully for four months, <PERSON> Wolfe </PERSON> said. He added, though, `` Three months ago, I got called up and told that the caller was praying for my soul.'' With the sculpture-covering, `` some will think those prayers were answered,'' <PERSON> Wolfe </PERSON> said with a laugh. `` But the decision we reached on this particular piece was not that it was provocative, but because of the younger visitors we have in the summer months.'' <PERSON> Wolfe </PERSON> said the draping `` was not a request of any group. It was a judgmental call I made.'' <PERSON> DeAndrea </PERSON> said Thursday from <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruz </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, that he was n't mad about the draping But he was n't pleased, either. `` It's happened a lot of times,'' he told the <ORGANIZATION> Arkansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gazette </ORGANIZATION>. `` I wish they had enough sense not to do it, but I guess they do n't. It's the same old same old.'' The life-size sculpture shows a woman leaning backward while seated on a box. It is displayed with a sculpture of a clothed man, a self-portrait of <PERSON> DeAndrea </PERSON>. <PERSON> Wolfe </PERSON> said he expected increased interest in the exhibit because of news coverage about the draping, most notably a front-page story in the <ORGANIZATION> Gazette </ORGANIZATION> headlined, `` Nude art clothed in cover-up.'' The sculpture is part of the <PERSON> Goldstrom </PERSON> family collection making a three-year national tour. A security guard at the arts center, <PERSON> Jackie </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, said he had seen some smaller children peeking under the cloth covering. `` It distracts them,'' <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said.

 Authorities obtained a court order to search the homes of a <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> serial killings suspect because they hoped to find records detailing aliases he may have used, a top police commander said. But what police took Wednesday from two <LOCATION> Spokane </LOCATION> residences used by <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> II were 55 cartons and bags of materials including 1,800 videotapes, travel receipts, police uniforms, more than two dozen firearms and about 100 police badges. Police suspected <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, a onetime <ORGANIZATION> Gonzaga </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> law student who has been jailed since January on unrelated charges, of using aliases that could not be checked out without obtaining records from his house, said <LOCATION> King </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> police Capt. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, commander of the <ORGANIZATION> Green </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> River </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>. `` That was the only reason we did the search warrant,'' he said in an interview in Saturday editions of the <ORGANIZATION> Seattle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post-Intelligencer </ORGANIZATION>. `` We know he kept a lot of records.'' <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, 38, has not been charged in any of the deaths and disappearances and denies any involvement in the case. But in a court document released Thursday, he was labeled a `` viable suspect'' in what has been called the nation's worst unsolved serial killings case. <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> said it would take a month to examine the large amount of material taken under search warrant from two <LOCATION> Spokane </LOCATION> homes used by <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>. One thing was ruled out, though, he said: The items did not include any clothing, jewelry or other effects from <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> victims. Police would not comment on the contents of the videotapes found in the two residences, except to say that at least some of them were homemade. The <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> killer, named for a stream south of <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> where some victims were found, has been blamed for the deaths of as many as 48 <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> women, many of them prostitutes, beginning seven years ago this month. <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> said the search warrants of the homes were sought because <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>' attorneys had not allowed their client to talk to police. `` We tried not to have to do this,'' <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> said. `` We made over a dozen efforts to interview him so we would n't have to go through this process.'' But <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Beles </PERSON>, a lawyer for <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, accused the task force of `` grasping at straws'' and said his client `` is concerned he's being singled out as the answer to a longtime investigation.'' He said <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> `` is a colorful character, but he's no murderer.'' In a lengthy affidavit used to obtained a search warrant, friends of <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> are quoted as saying he believed prostitutes were spreading AIDS, wanted to make films of hookers being dismembered and told others the killing of <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> victims had been filmed. <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> is jailed in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, serving a one-year term for the burglary of a police equipment supply store in 1979 and additional time for walking away from a work-release center in 1981. While police identified <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> several years ago as someone to check, <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> said `` Manhunt,'' a nationally syndicated television show broadcast last December about the <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> killing, prompted a phone call directing investigators to <ORGANIZATION> Gonzaga </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. That led to his arrest in January on the old escape charge. He is due to be held in that case at least until September, authorities said. <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> said there was no `` smoking gun,'' but said an initial study of documents found earlier showed that <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>' movements between 1981 and 1989 sometimes closely paralleled the killings. A spokeswoman for the Women's Coalition to Stop the <ORGANIZATION> Green </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> River </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Murders </ORGANIZATION>, a group that has frequently criticized the task force's efforts, said Friday that the searches of <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>' homes might be nothing more than a police publicity ploy `` I guess we're jaded at this point,'' said <PERSON> Cookie </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON>, noting the task force has carried out several search warrants in the past without producing any arrests.

 Weather forecasts here will have something new beginning this week _ the `` scorch factor,'' which two local physicians hope will remind folks of the dangers of skin cancer. With a shoebox-size device on the roof of a <ORGANIZATION> Baylor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> building, <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Menter </PERSON> and <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> can calculate how long it will take the sun's ultraviolet rays to start burning unprotected skin. The physicians have begun reporting to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> ultraviolet readings at 10 a.m., noon and 3 p.m., along with the number of minutes a sun-sensitive person can be exposed without harm. One <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> television station will add the roast quotient to its evening weather reports starting Monday, and several other TV and radio stations have expressed interest in the index. Similar reports are available through the weather service in <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> said. `` We're trying to make people aware that there is a sun out there that is doing damage to their skin,'' said <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>, a medical center internist who is switching to dermatology. <PERSON> Menter </PERSON>, a dermatologist, is medical director of the <ORGANIZATION> Baylor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Psoriasis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> has one of the highest rates of skin cancer in the country, <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> said. `` Of course, we're in the sun belt, and in the south you get more ultraviolet exposure,'' he said. `` And because of the weather, people tend to develop more of an outdoor lifestyle. So skin cancer is a real problem.'' He added that certain types of skin cancer can be fatal if not treated early, and sun damage can also hasten the aging of the skin. People who stay outside longer than the index suggests _ usually 15 to 30 minutes on a sunny or partly-cloudy day _ should cover up or apply sun screens, <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> said. He added that weather can fool people. `` They equate heat with sunburn, so they think August is going to be the peak'' in ultraviolet radiation, he said. In fact, the ultraviolet rays peak in June and July, then decline steadly to late December, when the sun is farthest away from the <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hemisphere </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Biggest Atom Smasher Starts Up</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Reseachers have successfully made the first test run of the world's biggest atom smasher, a 17-mile circular tunnel designed to unlock secrets of how the universe took shape, scientists said Saturday. On Friday evening, scientists at the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Particle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Physics </ORGANIZATION> outside the capital sent a first beam of particles around the new particle accelerator, known as the Large Electron-Positron Collider or LEP. The $ 790 million machine, built underground beneath the <LOCATION> French-Swiss </LOCATION> border, is expected to put the European lab ahead of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> rivals in the search for new discoveries in high-energy physics, although plans are in the works for a 53-mile super collider in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Carlo </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubbia </PERSON>, an Italian physics professor and Nobel laureate who heads the lab, cheered along with other scientists in the control room as instruments showed a positron beam completed its course in 50 minutes, said lab spokesman <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Calder </PERSON> said. A positron is a positively charged antiparticle of an electron. `` This simply means that all parts of the machine, all the magnets, are correctly positioned,'' said the spokesman for the lab outside <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, known by the French acronym <ORGANIZATION> CERN </ORGANIZATION>. The collider, built over eight years with funding from <ORGANIZATION> CERN </ORGANIZATION>'s 14 member states, is the most powerful particle accelerator and the largest scientific instrument ever made. <PERSON> Rubbia </PERSON> says it should `` guarantee <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> a dominant position in particle physics for many years to come.'' The <ORGANIZATION> LEP </ORGANIZATION> will recreate with new sophistication the wild swirl of matter just after the so-called big bang, the explosion many scientists believe created the universe up to 20 billion years ago. The three-mile <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Linear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Collider </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Menlo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, in April won the race to produce the first so-called Z particles, which scientists say could have existed naturally for only an instant after a big bang. But the <ORGANIZATION> CERN </ORGANIZATION> machine is expected to produce thousands of Z particles by September, opening a greater scope for discovery. Watching Z particles decay into other particles is expected to yield new clues to the structure of matter and the development of the universe. <PERSON> Rubbia </PERSON> shared the 1984 Physics Nobel Prize with Dutch scientist <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> der </PERSON> <PERSON> Meer </PERSON> for discovering the Z particle in an old particle accelerator at <ORGANIZATION> CERN </ORGANIZATION>, but stronger colliders are needed to make enough particles to allow scientists to draw conclusions. Z particles have also been produced at the <ORGANIZATION> Fermi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accelerator </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> near <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. That four-mile track was the biggest accelerator in the world until the new <ORGANIZATION> CERN </ORGANIZATION> machine was built.

<HEAD>Soviet Officer Says All Golf II Submarines to Leave Baltic</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 All Soviet Golf II submarines, which carry nuclear weapons, will be removed from the <LOCATION> Baltic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> early next year, a Soviet naval commander was quoted as saying in an interview published Saturday. General Staff officer <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Rudenko </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Dagens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nyheter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> newspaper </ORGANIZATION> that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> also would dislcose whether its warships were carrying nuclear weapons if they were invited to a Swedish port. Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> previously had talked of scrapping the dated Golf II submarines in the Baltic fleet, but he gave no date. The submarines, which date to the 1960s, are 325 feet long. Each carries three missile tubes, according to <PERSON> Jane </PERSON>'s Fighting Ships. The Soviet Baltic fleet has six to eight vessels armed with intermediate-range missiles. `` All Soviet nuclear submarines of the Golf II class will be removed from the <LOCATION> Baltic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> at the beginning of next year,'' <ORGANIZATION> Dagens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nyheter </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Rudenko </PERSON> as saying. `` Now we only wait for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to show its good intent.'' A Swedish defense spokeman declined to say if the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has other types of nuclear submarines in the Baltic. He said no Soviet ship has made a port call in <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> in about 25 years. <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> ships refuse as a matter of policy to say whether they are carrying nuclear weapons. All the Scandinavian countries have policies banning nuclear weapons in their ports. `` If our aircraft carrier <LOCATION> Kiev </LOCATION>, which has nuclear weapons on board, would be invited by <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Rudenko </PERSON> was quoted as saying, `` we would leave the nuclear weapons at home before coming to visit.'' <PERSON> Rudenko </PERSON> was identified by the paper as an officer responsible for peace and disarmament issues at the Soviet General Staff. Officials at the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> declined to comment or expand on the report. <PERSON> Rudenko </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> on Friday to participate in a Nordic youth trip to the Soviet naval base in <LOCATION> Murmansk </LOCATION> on the <LOCATION> Kola </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, her wish fulfilled, had lunch at a 17th century chateau Saturday after touring a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crafts exhibit that made her `` proud to be an American.'' As President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> tended to matter of state at the 15th annual economic summit, the first lady set off on her own. Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> toured several rooms of the 17th chateau owned by the Marquis and <PERSON> Marquise </PERSON> <PERSON> Jean-Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Ganay </PERSON>. `` Look at this, is n't it beautiful?'' marvelled Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as she emerged in the blazing sunshine to tour the vast gardens with their spring-fed ponds, laid out in the 17th century by the landscapist <PERSON> Lenotre </PERSON>, who designed the <LOCATION> Versailles </LOCATION> gardens for <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> XIV. `` I want you to get used to me here,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> joked with her host and hostess, the <PERSON> Marquis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Marquise </PERSON> <PERSON> Jean-Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Ganay </PERSON>. Joining Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on the tour were <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kitty </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, wives of the secretaries of state and treasury. `` Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wanted to see a chateau and pretty garden,'' said <PERSON> Sondra </PERSON> <PERSON> Daley </PERSON>, a spokesman for the first lady. The choice was made by Ambassador <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Curley </PERSON> and his wife, who know the de Ganay family. Like many aristocratic owners, the de Ganays allow visitors to pay admission to tour the chateau at certain times to defray maintenance costs. Strolling around the gardens, Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> called to two dogs to pose with her for a picture. `` Come on you two dogs, they want us in the center,'' she said. Referring to her own pet, she added, `` I hope <PERSON> Millie </PERSON> will take note and not be jealous. She'll eat her heart out.'' Earlier Saturday, Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> toured the `` Craft USA Today'' show at the Decorative Arts branch of the <LOCATION> Louvre </LOCATION> museum, where the work of 183 American artisans, ranging from patchwork quilts to a ceramic briefcase, is displayed. `` It makes you proud to be an American,'' she said. She looked at her watch to see if a wooden clock called `` Time to Say Goodbye'' by <PERSON> Wendell </PERSON> <PERSON> Castle </PERSON> was keeping time. A museum spokesman said it had not been wound. `` I love that,'' she said of an enormous tulipwood spheroid by <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Moulthrop </PERSON>. `` That's amazing,'' she said of a multicolored glass creation by <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Chihuly </PERSON>. `` One man blowing that. It's beautiful.'' When someone asked if she would like it for her <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> vacation house, she said, `` No, it's too grand for <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION>.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> posed holding hands with a glazed clay 10-foot-high statue of a man splashed with garish colors by <PERSON> Viola </PERSON> <PERSON> Frey </PERSON>. `` It's just like in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, when you get your picture taken with the president _ or the first lady,'' referring to the cardboard photo setups popular with tourists outside 1600 <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Avenue </LOCATION>.

 <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> brought its glory days to a crescendo Saturday by saluting its revolution's bicentennial with a storm of sound and color over the city many French regard as the capital of the world. A 45-minute spray of 170,000 rockets over the Eiffel Tower at nightfall followed early morning fireworks. Before a final bouquet of multicolored bursts in the evening show, jostling crowds gasped at the piece de resistance: a 200-foot-wide fresco of blue and red framing a white outline of a ship symbolizing <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. Blue, red, and white are the colors of the French flag. On Friday night, a parade, created by advertising maverick <PERSON> Jean-Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Goude </PERSON>, presented a whimsical blend of history, folklore and the outer limits of French fancy. <PERSON> Goude </PERSON> described it as two hours of controlled madness. A million people mobbed the mile-long Champs-Elysees to see the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> A & amp; M <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> marching band dance the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> worm, a Russian ballarina waltz on ice skates with a polar bear, and lancers fling flowing French tricolors like batons. <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> drummers flanked a full-size locomotive, banging on 55-gallon steel barrels. Chinese students wheeled bicycles, solemnly jingling their bells, under a banner reading, `` We Will Continue,'' a reference to the crushed pro-democracy movement in their homeland. On one gigantic float, a conductor-witchdoctor in a tux gyrated atop a rolling mountain of pounding African drummers. At the summit, six undulating Senegalese women, dressed in blue, white and red gowns, depicted a waving <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> flag. Halfway through, singer <PERSON> Jessye </PERSON> <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> electrified the heart of <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> with `` <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Marseillaise </PERSON>,'' <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s national anthem. Her American nationality, organizers said, highlighted the revolution's universal character But the crux of a thrilling, infuriating weekend the French will never forget seemed to be the traditional July 14 morning event, when <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> paraded its missiles down the Champs-Elysees. Behind glass at the Place de la Concorde, President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> was flanked by the leaders of 33 nations from five continents, including six of the richest and some of the poorest. He sat between <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, president of a superpower, and <PERSON> Felix </PERSON> <PERSON> Houphouet-Boigny </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Ivory </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>, symbol of an empire <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> colonized and, by its measure, civilized. Bicentennial celebrations and a coinciding <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seven </ORGANIZATION> summit of industrial nations drove home <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>'s message that <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> sees itself neither as part of the First World nor the Third but rather of a separate constellation illuminating the way for others. But not everyone shared official enthusiasm for the French Revolution _ or its 1989 commemoration. Many Parisians fled town, unwilling to fete a violent civil war or simply afraid of the crowds. Some who stayed grumbled bitterly at the massive security blanket. `` To an old Parisian, this reminds me of something I have seen before, but without the swastikas,'' remarked one old Parisian. Many saw ironies in the system of privilege that remains 200 years after the revolution. Only those with invitations, or the patience to wait six hours along the route, got a good look at the parade. Television coverage mostly missed the zany, impressionist mood. Thursday night's street dance at the Bastille was billed as the world's biggest all-night party. In a twist of history, officers stormed the citizenry to break it up. British Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> had observed on French television that human rights originated in ancient <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> and were affirmed in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Magna </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carta </ORGANIZATION> of 1215. She called the French Revolution a reign of terror that contributed little to humanity. When Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> appeared among other dignitaries on giant screens off the Champs-Elysees, crowds booed. But mostly, <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> was a raucous party. People wore silly hats, bought tricolored underwear and gave little serious thought to history books. The Seine flowed thick with champagne corks, beer cans and other debris of revelry. The well-connected had dinner at dawn with Ms. <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> and singer <PERSON> Grace </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> at Le Palace. Others simply found the nearest music and did anything from funky chicken to fox-trot. Sometimes, the mood turned ugly as young toughs threw firecrackers at people's feet or dropped gas bombs into crowds as thick as bearnaise sauce. But many Parisians said they had not seen such gaiety, color and unabashed outpouring of national pride since 1944, when Allied forces joined <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> troops in liberating <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. As the weekend wound down, <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>'s chauffeur set out on a personal mission to carry <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s message across the world. He is leading a convoy of <ORGANIZATION> Renault </ORGANIZATION> vans to <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, via <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. Three bear the names associated with the French Revolution since 1789: Liberty, Equality and Brotherhood. The fourth is named Hope.

 French President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> on Saturday gave the summit leaders a personal guided tour of his pet project _ 12th century ruins discovered beneath the <LOCATION> Louvre </LOCATION>. After their first full day of talks came to an end under the Pyramid, the avant-garde glass structure that sits in the <LOCATION> Louvre </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON> <PERSON> Courtyard </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mitterand </PERSON> guided his guests from the underground meeting site and into the excavated ruins under the museum The 8-meter-high moat walls and guard towers are all that remains of the castle fortress of French King Philippe-Auguste. Construction of the Louvre was begun in the 16th century on top of the medieval fortress, of which only an 80-square-meter section survives. The relic of medieval <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> is dear to <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>'s heart, officials said, because it was only discovered during the excavations to build the complex underneath the architecturally controversial Pyramid. Both <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> and his culture minister, <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Lang </PERSON>, were roundly criticized for plunking down the gleaming glass Pyramid in the <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON> <PERSON> Courtyard </PERSON> of the austere U-shaped Louvre, the world's largest royal palace, and now one of the world's most famous museums `` Mr. <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> loves this place,'' said <PERSON> Evelyne </PERSON> <PERSON> Richard </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the French president. `` The construction of the pyramid began in 1983, and the works were delayed because of this find.'' While <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> led the way down a subterranean boardwalk in the dry moat bed, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s director of museums, <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Laclotte </PERSON>, explained the history of the fortress to West German Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>, President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Prime Ministers <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Suosuke </PERSON> <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Ciriaco </PERSON> <PERSON> Mita </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>, his guests, and their interpreters then crowded into a dimly lit antechamber where there is a display of artifacts discovered during the excavation. A cacophony of languages echoed off the concrete walls as the translators struggled to keep pace with <PERSON> Laclotte </PERSON>'s explanations, and the Western leaders asked questions. Among the finds were a golden fragment of the crown of the late medieval King <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> VI </PERSON>. After the tour, <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> led his guests into the Louvre for champagne and hors d'oeuvres, as the setting sun streamed through the windows of the palace on the Seine. The setting for the cocktail session was a recently opened gallery of Greek and Roman statuary, which the summit leaders toured as they chatted.

As it turned out, a low fuel gauge reading prompted officials to postpone Saturday's planned flight of the B-2, disappointing thousands of aviation buffs who gathered outside the air base. The unexpected arrival of the stray <ORGANIZATION> Cessna </ORGANIZATION> played no role in the decision to scrub the flight, said <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Col. <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennett </PERSON>.

 Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> mistakenly credited a moon landing to a congressman convicted of a sex charge, amusing a crowd of Young Republicans at the group's national convention Saturday. `` This next Thursday, July 20th, will be an historic date for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> as <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> celebrates the 20th anniversary of <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON> and <PERSON> Buz </PERSON> <PERSON> Lukens </PERSON> walking on the moon,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said.

 New tests confirmed that the crippled tanker <PERSON> Exxon </PERSON> <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON> is leaking crude oil as it sits offshore in rough seas, but the oil is decomposing, the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> said Saturday. `` We do have some very weathered and degraded traces of crude oil in the slick,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> Lt. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Solberg </PERSON>. `` There's also heavy concentrations of organic components.'' Microorganisms and plankton made up some of the organic compounds found with the crude, <PERSON> Solberg </PERSON> said. More tests are being conducted to determine the toxicity of the materials. <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> officials Saturday insisted the releases from the damaged tanker were small and posed no environmental threat. `` There is no significant pollution. There has been no significant pollution,'' <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipping </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> president <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Iarossi </PERSON> said at a joint news briefing held by <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>. `` There is no oil in the water.'' The Exxon Valdez ran aground March 24 in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> and spilled nearly 11 million gallons of crude oil into Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON>. The tanker was cleaned and towed 2,500 miles to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> for extensive repairs to its shredded hull. It has been barred from entering port, however, because five steel plates that peeled from the ship's frame during the voyage must be cut off before it can fit through the bay channel. The rough seas Saturday apparently tore loose a sixth steel slab from the hull framing, said <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> Cmdr. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Montoro </PERSON>. A state wildlife official disputed <PERSON> Iarossi </PERSON>'s assessment of the slick and said state agencies will demand that the vessel be free of any discharge before being brought into state waters for repairs. `` I do n't want any vessel to discharge oil, not this one or any other,'' said <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, pollution response officer in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> for the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fish </ORGANIZATION> and Game. `` It's harmful to marine organisms.'' <PERSON> Iarossi </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> would comply with state and federal demands, and welcomed the new tests. `` We're going through a process that will hopefully reduce the level of concern by the state agencies and the public,'' he said. `` It's a process that we have to go through. ` I ca n't come barging in here and say, ` I want to bring my ship in.''' The new round of tests were ordered after the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> and state Fish and Game Department arrived at different conclusions after analyzing one of the sheens created off the coast of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>. Wildlife officials concluded the 18-mile-long slick contained traces of petroleum products, but the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> tests determined it consisted of unidentified organic matter and was oil-free. The discrepancy prompted a second test by the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>. The tests were conducted on samples from the slick spotted near the <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION> when it arrived off the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> coast Monday. The ship, about 60 miles offshore, is still discharging a small amount of a blue-brown slick into the water, <PERSON> Solberg </PERSON> said. But it has been confined to the immediate area of the ship and dissipated rapidly. Meanwhile, sea conditions have worsened in the area and the <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION> crew, along with the tugboat towing it, were trying to move the vessel to a new position to better withstand the 10-foot swells and six-foot seas, he said. State Attorney General <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Kamp </PERSON> on Friday filed a precautionary lawsuit Friday in <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diego </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> which seeks to ensure that the tanker remains outside <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> waters until officials are satisfied it's free of toxic materials. Although <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipping </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> has shown a willingness to cooperate, <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Kamp </PERSON> said he filed the lawsuit to ensure the existence of `` an enforcement mechanism for whatever agreement we are able to reach with <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>.'' <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman Jan Cool declined to comment on the state's action, saying company officials had n't yet been able to review it

<DATELINE>PARIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Leaders of the world's seven richest industrial nations, striving to project a united front, voiced support Saturday for democracy behind the Iron Curtain and condemned repression in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> during a gathering that even attracted the attention of Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. In a surprising development, the leader of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> called on the summit chiefs to link his country's economy to their own. The extraordinary appeal became the principal subject of discussion at the summit leaders' dinner meeting, according to French spokesman <PERSON> Hubert </PERSON> <PERSON> Vedrine </PERSON>. He called <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s letter totally unexpected. Aside from the Soviet leader's appeal, the economic summit was so harmonious the world leaders decided to end their three-day meeting several hours earlier than scheduled Sunday, the first time any of the 15 annual gatherings was cut short. The letter from <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> was read to the leaders by French President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said it `` is obvious that the rest of the world can only gain by the opening to the world economy of a market such as that of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>.'' He petitioned the West to consider the reforms he is making in the communist Soviet economy and to let his country play a larger role in world economic affairs. Any disputes that did occur among the leaders of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> were either papered over or ignored as the summit nations issued a political communique Saturday. The second day of discussions was held on the 35th floor of the Grand Arch, an avant-garde marble and glass office building offering a spectacular view of <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, in a briefing for reporters, called his ninth consecutive summit `` the most harmonious and one of the most productive summits that I have attended.'' The rich nations were lavish in their encouragement for political and economic reforms in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, but they did not back up the kind words with any specific commitment of money. But <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> indicated that he was pleased with the support provided by his fellow summit leaders, saying the commitments they made had `` vindicated'' his approach to fostering economic and political reforms in the communist <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> attended the summit at the end of a history-making trip to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, where he unveiled a $ 140 million package of aid to the two nations. British Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> said that all of the summit nations were `` very anxious to help. We are all helping, each in our own way.'' The annual economic gathering was interspersed between the pomp and pageantry of the 200th anniversary of the French Revolution. <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>, who considers himself a champion of Third World causes, invited more than two dozen leaders of developing countries to rub shoulders with the Summit Seven during the festivities. But the French president gave up an effort to get his summit partners to endorse a call for a North-South summit between rich and poor countries to address the economic plight of poor countries. The summit will conclude Sunday with a round of meetings and the issuance of a final communique, expected to focus on such issues as Third World debt and a pledge to clean up global pollution. At the urging of West German Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>, the document on political issues was amended Saturday at the last minute to include a proposal to convene an emergency meeting within the next few weeks to deal with the `` urgent need for food assistance'' for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. Officials said the session could be used as the launching pad for a massive foodlift to shortage-plagued <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. European nations are currently stockpiling surplus meat, sugar, grain and some dairy products that could be used to ease the economic difficulties of the Poles. British Foreign Secretary Sir <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Howe </PERSON>, briefing reporters, said that it was envisioned that the conference would organize both food and cash contributions for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> but it was unclear just how much food aid would be forthcoming. The leaders also reaffirmed their support for easing <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s $ 39 billion foreign debt burden but skipped specifics on how much relaxation in the repayment schedule they were willing to finance. On <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, the seven democracies called on <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> to `` cease action against those who have done no more than claim their legitimate rights to democracy and liberty'' but the leaders stopped short of announcing any stiffer sanctions in response to the bloody crackdown on dissent. In his letter to the summit gathering, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> called for increased East-West cooperation on economic matters saying such links would prove beneficial to both sides. `` Our perestroika -LRB- restructuring -RRB- is inseparable from the policy tending toward full and entire participation in the world economy,'' wrote <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. The summit leaders, while not responding directly to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s message, expressed their approval for easing <ORGANIZATION> East-West </ORGANIZATION> tensions but said <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> `` remains a threat to each of us'' because of a military balance that favors the Communist bloc Presidential spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said that the Soviet letter was read by <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> during the leaders' afternoon session and that the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration was generally supportive of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s proposals for greater economic coordination. The leaders also condemned international terrorism and vowed to bring terrorists to justice. They called for stepped up international efforts to protect against aircraft hijackings and sabotage in the wake of the bombing of <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> flight 103 that killed 270 people in <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, last December. In a clear reference to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and its allies in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, the leaders called `` on those holding hostages to release them immediately and unconditionally and on those with influence over hostage-takers to use it to this end.''

 An attorney for a woman charged with killing her 6-week-old daughter and claiming the infant was abducted has asked for a gag order and change of venue for the woman's trial. <PERSON> Paula </PERSON> <PERSON> Sims </PERSON> is also accused of concealing the 1986 death of her first daughter, 13-day-old Loralei, whom she reported abducted under circumstances similar to the disappearance of 6-week-old <PERSON> Heather </PERSON> in April. After a hearing Friday on other charges against <PERSON> Mrs. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sims </PERSON> in <PERSON> Heather </PERSON>'s death, attorney <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Groshong </PERSON> filed motions asking that the murder trial be moved from <LOCATION> Madison </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> because of news coverage. He's also seeking to have police and prosecutors barred from publicly discussing the case. A ruling on the motions is expected at a hearing scheduled July 21 on the murder charge against Mrs. <PERSON> Sims </PERSON>. Mrs. <PERSON> Sims </PERSON>, 30, has denied any wrongdoing. At Friday's hearing, <LOCATION> Madison </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Associate Judge <PERSON> Ellar </PERSON> <PERSON> Duffwilliams </PERSON> ordered Mrs. <PERSON> Sims </PERSON> to stand trial on charges of obstructing justice and concealing <PERSON> Heather </PERSON>'s death. Mrs. <PERSON> Sims </PERSON> was charged with murder in that death on Tuesday. In the case of both disappearences, Mrs. <PERSON> Sims </PERSON> reported that a masked gunman abducted the baby girls while her husband, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON>, was away at work. Police say they have found no evidence to support her assertion and consider the couple the prime suspects. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Sims </PERSON> has not been charged in either case, and the only murder charge against his wife is in <PERSON> Heather </PERSON>'s death. An autopsy showed that <PERSON> Heather </PERSON>'s body had been frozen before it was dumped in a trash can on May 3, four days after Mrs. <PERSON> Sims </PERSON> reported her daughter kidnapped.

 A group of 17 women bared their breasts in front of the national Women's Hall of Fame on Saturday to protest a state law that prohibits women from going shirtless in public. The women marched to the museum and gave speeches before taking off their shirts in front of about 200 people during an annual convention commemorating the birth of the women's movement here. Local police and state troopers stood by during the demonstration, but no arrests were made. The women bared their breasts for about two minutes, then put their shirts back on and left. The protest came nearly three weeks after ten members of the group were arrested in <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION> for baring their breasts on a beach. They're scheduled to appear in city court on Aug. 1 to answer charges of exposure of person, a violation, to which they've pleaded innocent. <PERSON> Ramona </PERSON> <PERSON> Santorelli </PERSON>, one of the women who participated in the protest, said the group, called the <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Topfree </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Equality </ORGANIZATION>, wanted to make the statement that rules against shirtless women were discriminatory. `` I think that people are making the connection, the deeper issues. We're not just exposing our breasts.

<HEAD>Jordan's King Condemns Israeli Peace Proposal</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> on Saturday rejected the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> peace plan for the occupied territories, saying it did not represent the goals of Palestinians. The plan `` is obviously, as it is, totally unacceptable,'' <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> said in an interview on Channel 4's `` World This Week'' program. `` It denies the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> everything they aspire to achieve.'' `` I believe that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> must be persuaded to review its position, and it is the duty of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s friends the world over ... to save <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, and save all of us as a result,'' <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> said. Under the plan, Palestinians in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> would elect representatives to negotiate a peace settlement with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Earlier this month, Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> accepted several hard-line conditions set by his right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc, including an end to the 19-month uprising in the territories before negotiations begin. Another condition is that Jews would be allowed to continue settling in the occupied lands. The conditions angered the left-of-center <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which shares power with <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> in a coalition government. Labor has said the conditions virtually kill the proposal because they are unacceptable to Palestinians.

 A clerk at historic Christ Church discovered large underground vaults containing caskets and evidence of long-forgotten catacombs under a courtyard where <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s founders walked to worship. `` We knew there were graves down there,'' <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> <PERSON> Gill </PERSON>, the church's clerk of the works, said Friday after his discovery at the 262-year-old church where the <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> was formed in 1789. Although church officials assumed that several people were probably buried in vaults that appeared to hold only one person, the size of the vaults surprised <PERSON> Gill </PERSON>, he said. `` They were a lot bigger than anyone imagined,'' he said, describing them as the size of a Victorian bedroom, slightly larger than 10 feet square. One vault, bearing the family names of <PERSON> Binney </PERSON> and Cox, held 10 cedar caskets, some thinned by deterioration, making skeletal remains visible. Another vault, carved with the name of the <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Waller </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON>, rector for a month in 1836, contained four or five lead caskets. No one has been buried since 1949 in a family vault at the church, which was built between 1727 and 1754, <PERSON> Gill </PERSON> said. Five signers of the Declaration of Independence are buried at the church, which is part of Independence National Historical Park and is considered one of the nation's finest examples of Colonial architecture.

They also said the engine's experimental enlarged throat for the main combustion chamber may be a feature of space shuttles by 1995. The throat is designed to allow the engine to run at lower pressures and temperatures than now exist on the space shuttle. The last test on June 22 was automatically shut down after 40 seconds because nitrogen contaminated the engine's liquid hydrogen system.

 Two attackers raided a Mormon chapel in this <LOCATION> Santiago </LOCATION> suburb Saturday, set it on fire and left pamphlets of a leftist guerrilla group, authorities said. No one was injured in the attack, the second this month on a Mormon chapel in <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. In the previous attack on July 7, seven assailants interrupted a chapel gathering, forced the missionary to undress and then fled. No one was injured; church officials later said the attackers may have wanted simply to humiliate the missionary. Police said they have made no arrests in either attack. Leftist guerrillas have a history of making such attacks in recent years. They say the <ORGANIZATION> Mormon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, is a force for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> imperialism. In Saturday's predawn attack, the two men brandished pistols and told the watchman <PERSON> Celestino </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, `` This is a robbery,'' <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> said. However, he said, they then poured a flammable liquid on the wooden chapel, which is about 40 feet long, and set it on fire before fleeing. <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> said he put out the fire himself. The pamphlets the attackers left behind were from a small group of urban radicals known as the <ORGANIZATION> Lautaro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rebel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>. That same group claimed responsibility for the earlier attack in <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Mormon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION> had no immediate comment on Saturday's attack A church spokesman said after earlier incidents that most of the approximately 250 Mormon missionaries in the country are Chilean.

 A judge Saturday denied custody of an 18-month-old girl to the couple accused of paying $ 1,100 and a plane ticket for her. Dade Circuit Judge <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Barad </PERSON> also denied custody of Crystal <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> DeMetro </PERSON> to her maternal grandparents, saying they were unfit to take care of her, and returned the case to <ORGANIZATION> Juvenile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. `` All four contestants for this child are in need of psychotherapy. They all have personality disorders,'' <PERSON> Barad </PERSON> said in a nine-page ruling. <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> DeMetro </PERSON>, accused of buying the girl, tried to gain legal custody of Crystal after the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rehabilitative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> asked that she be given to her maternal grandparents. The DeMetros allegedly gave <ORGANIZATION> Crystal </ORGANIZATION>'s natural mother <PERSON> Camara </PERSON> <PERSON> Heistand </PERSON> a total of $ 1,100 in $ 100 bills, clothing, a box of candy and a plan ticket and went through an elaborate name-change ruse with the mother's cooperation. `` In summary, the DeMetros spun a web of deceit, and the court can not permit the child to be caught in that web,'' <PERSON> Barad </PERSON> said. `` I'm very disappointed, and I want my baby back,'' said <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> DeMetro </PERSON>, wiping away tears and walking away from reporters. HRS spokesman <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Powers </PERSON> said, `` Basically, it goes back to the beginning, except in a different arena.'' Crystal's fate now rests with the county <ORGANIZATION> Juvenile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, which will determine if she should become a ward of the state and become eligible for adoption. She will remain in a foster home where she has lived since the judge took Crystal away from the DeMetros in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> in June. No one has been excluded as adoptive parents. The grandparents, <PERSON> Chad </PERSON> and <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Dornsife </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tahoe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, began a nationwide search for Crystal after learning their granddaughter had been given up in 1987. The Dornsifes claim the DeMetros are gypsies and their life style is inappropriate for Crystal. `` Simply, the Dornsifes have not demonstrated that they could provide the necessary care, attention, shelter and a moral environment that would be conducive to and serve the best interests of Crystal,'' the judge said. The mother does n't want the child, and the father is unknown. <PERSON> Lester </PERSON> <PERSON> Langer </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> attorney representing the Dornsifes, said the judge's order was incorrect but expected. He called the order a partial victory because it allows the Dornsifes more time to present their case for adoption.

<HEAD>D.C., Maryland Housing Officials Say Developers Boasted Inside Track

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 State and local housing officials in and around the nation's capital say developers increasingly asserted they had connections in the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration that would guarantee scarce federal housing funds, a published report says. `` They'd say, if <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> needs the units, this is the only way to get them,'' said <PERSON> Alphonso </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, public housing director for the <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> in 1987 and 1988. `` I said, ` I will not put the city manager or the mayor in a position to be haunted by this,''' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>. Sunday's edition of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reports that developers seeking funds through the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>'s moderate rehabiltation program often dropped the names of high-ranking government officials like then-assistant secretary for housing <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Demery </PERSON>, and former <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Watt </PERSON> Several federal housing programs have been under scrutiny by <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for alleged mismanagement and fraud. `` It was public knowledge that if you were wired in as a Republican, you got funding,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> told the newspaper. He said local housing directors, the mayors or the city councils should n't be blamed because `` they figure they may not be following the rules, but they are addressing the need.'' <PERSON> Trudy </PERSON> <PERSON> McFall </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>'s communiy development administrator, said there was no question that the state received funds that had been steered. Under the moderate rehabilitation program, local housing authorities, not individual developers, were to apply to federal funds. Developers then were to offer competitive proposals for project funding. However, <PERSON> McFall </PERSON> said developer <PERSON> Judith </PERSON> <PERSON> Siegel </PERSON> correctly told her of changes in <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> procedures in 1987 that would qualify <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> for previously denied funds. <PERSON> Siegel </PERSON> told her of the changes before <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> notified the state, <PERSON> McFall </PERSON> said. <PERSON> McFall </PERSON> said <PERSON> Siegel </PERSON> claimed she received her information from <PERSON> Demery </PERSON>. <PERSON> Siegel </PERSON>, who the newspaper said could not be reached for comment, has testified before a congressional subcommittee that she paid <PERSON> Watt </PERSON> $ 300,000 in consulting fees for the Kingsley Park development project in <LOCATION> Essex </LOCATION>, Md. Both <PERSON> Watt </PERSON> and <PERSON> Seigel </PERSON> said their actions were legal.

 Twenty years after man walked on the moon, those responsible for that `` one giant leap for mankind'' said the space program needs another bold challenge to recapture <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s imagination. And with <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s imagination, they said, will come the financial support needed for a daring project, such as landing astronauts on <LOCATION> Mars </LOCATION>. On Saturday, a soldout crowd of more than 4,000 people joined the Apollo 11 crew _ <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON>, <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> `` Buzz'' <PERSON> Aldrin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> _ at the <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Space </LOCATION> and Rocket Center for the first of four celebrations around the country to commemorate the lunar landing on July 20, 1969. <LOCATION> Huntsville </LOCATION>'s celebration focuses on the role this northern <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> city and the <PERSON> Wernher </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Braun </PERSON> rocket team at <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Marshall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flight </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> played in developing the Saturn V rocket to propel Apollo 11 on its journey to the moon The celebration was like a high-tech rock concert without the music. Lasers bounced off rockets exhibited throughout the center, sound effects simulated the takeoff of the Saturn V rocket to the moon, and actors portrayed <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON>'s and <PERSON> Aldrin </PERSON>'s walk on the rugged lunar landscape four days after blasting off from Kennedy Space Center. It climaxed with the Apollo 11 crew rising from a cloud of smoke 20 feet into the air to the front of a giant movie screen showing footage of their travels. The crew was surrounded by a cacophony of fireworks and dozens of dancing laser beams. <PERSON> Aldrin </PERSON>, who spent much of his time in <LOCATION> Huntsville </LOCATION> autographing his new book `` Men from <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>,'' describes the 20th anniversary as `` bittersweet.'' That's because he worries that <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> `` will sink to second-rate status'' in space if it continues on its present course. The 59-year-old former astronaut said Saturday he hoped the anniversary would help <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> set well-defined space objectives instead of having each space shuttle flight `` being an entity into itself.'' `` There is an excitement about the past but there is not an awareness of where we want to go,'' he said in an interview. He envisions the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> working with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> on space research projects, with a goal of developing spaceships that will take advantage of planetary movements to slingshot between <LOCATION> Mars </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> on five-month cycles. <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>, 58, also called for greater direction in the space program. `` One of these days, and I hope it's not too long, this country is going to decide it wants to go to Mars,'' he told a gathering of engineers who worked on the Apollo project. <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON>, 58, told the same group, `` A machine is man-made and hence imperfect. No one has ever made a perfect machine. Those of you who made the <ORGANIZATION> Saturn </ORGANIZATION> V came about as close as history ever recorded.'' <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, director at <ORGANIZATION> Marshall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flight </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Huntsville </LOCATION> and a former member of the von <PERSON> Braun </PERSON> team, vividly remembers President <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s seemingly impossible challenge to land a man on the moon by the end of the 1960s. No president has issued an equally bold challenge since then, but he hopes President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will in a 20th anniversary speech Thursday. `` We must continue what <PERSON> Wernher </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Braun </PERSON> and Apollo 11 started many years ago, that is to reach out and touch another world,'' he said. `` This time our launching pad is going to be the space station.'' <PERSON> Konrad </PERSON> <PERSON> Dannenberg </PERSON>, a German rocket scientist who came to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> with <PERSON> Von </PERSON> <PERSON> Braun </PERSON> after World War II and later supervised engineering and testing of the Saturn rocket, said the moon landing `` was the biggest step for mankind that has ever taken place. I hope this -LRB- anniversary -RRB- is the first step toward an even bigger achievement.'' <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Buckbee </PERSON>, director of the Space and Rocket Center, a tourist attraction focused on space achievements, and a former member of <PERSON> Von </PERSON> <PERSON> Braun </PERSON>'s staff, said he hopes `` President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> gives us a goal. I've heard everything from a moon colony to a man on <LOCATION> Mars </LOCATION>, with a space plane in there. <PERSON> Buckbee </PERSON> said he sees only one way for <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> to recapture <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s imagination and pocketbook `` It's got to be a man on Mars landing,'' he said. `` I do n't think a space station is going to capture <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> imagination It's got to be something that puts man and machine against the hazards of space.

<TEXT>
 To meet growing demand for satellite launch services, a new deal has been struck between two great superpowers _ the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. A joint venture agreement gives a group of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> entrepreneurs exclusive rights to market products and services of the Soviet space agency, Glavkosmos, in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` The Soviets could n't be nicer. You could n't ask for better bunch of partners,'' said <PERSON> Buck </PERSON> <PERSON> Hightower </PERSON>, a founder of the Houston-based <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which is selling everything from official Glavkosmos T-shirts to launch services for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> satellite companies wanting to hitch a ride on a Soviet Proton rocket. During a break from overseeing a crowded T-shirt stand at the entrance to the <LOCATION> U.S.S.R. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pavilion </LOCATION> at the <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> Air Show in mid-June, <PERSON> Hightower </PERSON> recalled how a group of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> red necks found themselves doing business on Red Square. `` We were trying to sell some idle oilfield equipment to the Soviets,'' <PERSON> Hightower </PERSON> said, adding that the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> good ol' boy network led him to <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Dula </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> aerospace attorney and former <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> consultant who had broad <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> contacts. `` We got to know the neighbors.'' Glasnost was booming, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> rocket companies were unable to meet American business' demand for launch services, `` so we decided to engage in a little creative international trade,'' <PERSON> Hightower </PERSON> said. They rang <PERSON> Alexandr </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunayev </PERSON>, head of Glavkosmos, `` who thought it was a fine idea,'' <PERSON> Hightower </PERSON> said. The high sheriffs at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> were n't so sure. <PERSON> Dula </PERSON>, now president of <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>, wanted the Soviet rocket to blast off from a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> site carrying the first payload, two communications satellites for <ORGANIZATION> Hughes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aircraft </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said no way. The Texans then decided to launch from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Under the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> denied an export license to <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>. Under the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration, the Texans have found a more receptive <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and they plan to apply for another export license soon, <PERSON> Dula </PERSON> said in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> this past week. If the license is denied again, his <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> company will launch the Soviet rocket from another country such as <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> and will haul a payload containing no American parts. The fee for a ride on the Red rocket is about $ 30 million. Besides T-shirts and rockets, <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> also offers a range of other Soviet space agency services, including navigational aids and flights aboard the space station Mir. Moreover, Space Commerce can write contracts for advertisers who want to proclaim their product or service on the side of a Soviet rocket. The Soviets disclosed recently that they want to exploit commercial opportunities that their space program has created, including putting ads in space, seen by millions of television viewers during blastoffs. In addition, <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> soon plans to conduct tours to Soviet space facilities never before open to the public _ American or Soviet. Tourists will be able to visit the <ORGANIZATION> Mission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Kaliningrad </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, or <LOCATION> Star </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, where cosmonauts train, with sidetrips to the <LOCATION> Bolshoi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ballet </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> Circus. `` Our feeling is that there must be a place in the world economy for the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Hightower </PERSON>, who also heads an <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION> property development company. During the air show last month, the <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> partners did a brisk business selling T-shirts, mostly to <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> visitors. Approached quietly by a gray-haired man in a business suit, partner <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brandes </PERSON> said: `` No sir, just T-shirts here. The back part is where they're selling the rockets.''

<HEAD>Tax Tide Appears to be Rising</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 When the tax tide begins rising, as it now may be, public protest seems to be as ineffectual a weapon as a broom swishing against another tide, the one that comes in from the oceans. But do n't lose heart. You can not afford to. You can say no to taxes, says <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Humbert </PERSON>, an economic scholar. He already has, loudly and succinctly. Whether his message, delivered to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, has had much of an impact is difficult to say, but it should n't be forgotten, because months later his points remain meaningful. <PERSON> Humbert </PERSON>, a fellow in political economy at the <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, a conservative think tank that was influential in the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration and still carries clout at the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, lists seven reasons for saying no. Tax increases, he says, hurt economic growth, undermine tax equity, lead to higher government spending, endanger international competitiveness and invite chaos in financial markets. Moreover, he continues, the nation's budget deficit already is shrinking, and a balanced budget can still be achieved without raising taxes. In fact, he says, economic expansion is the only sure way to reduce the deficit. But tax increases, he contends, have the opposite impact: They limit economic growth by undermining the climate for saving and investing. `` Every tax drains money from the private marketplace to government programs,'' he points out. Taxes impose on the private sector a complexity of regulations and paperwork. They draw sustenance from capital formation. Seldom, he suggests, are taxes just. By his reckoning, the median-income family of four did not pay a cent of income taxes in 1948; now their tax bill is almost $ 2,700. Increases, he says, can only mean that such families become more dependent on government services, which of course are financed by taxes. There is a pernicious aspect _ at least one _ to tax increases. The one chosen by <PERSON> Humbert </PERSON> is this: `` Increasing tax revenues relieve the pressure for budget cuts and usually result in higher spending.'' In defense of this claim, he cites as evidence a study conducted for the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, which estimated that for every dollar of tax increases in postwar <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, spending was raised by $ 1.52. Besides, he continues, a tax increase now constitutes poor timing. A global economy is developing, and that means competition for markets among all industrial powers. High taxes, he suggests, could make us less competitive. But, you may respond, we must close the gap between budget expenditures and revenues. <PERSON> Humbert </PERSON>'s immediate response is that the gap already is growing smaller. But, important as it is, the gap may be getting too much attention. He suggests that our attention is similar to that of eyeing the hole rather than the doughnut. What's more important than the deficit in any one year, he says, is the accumulation of debt. In that regard, he calls attention to the fact that in 1946 the national debt amounted to 120 percent of gross national product, and almost 50 percent in 1959. Today, he says, the percentage is down to 43, and falling. Besides, he continues, a tax increase is n't needed to balance the budget. In his view, a 4 percent growth in federal expenditures and continued economic expansion would bring the budget into balance by 1993. Finally, he contends that a tax increase would signal financial markets that American policy-makers were returning to the days of the 1970s when, <PERSON> Humbert </PERSON> asserts, `` capital formation and investment were almost destroyed by the twin forces of inflation and tax-induced stagnation.'' What is his recipe for success? A big job: Sweeping back the tide and sending it the other way with `` tax rate reductions that encourage risk-taking for entrepreneurs, small business people, and innovators _ the people who generate the most jobs in our economy.''

<HEAD>Soybean Edict Brings Bronx Cheer From Farmers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> says it averted a crisis but the exchange faces a chorus of criticism after forcing a selloff of soybean futures. The biggest boos are coming from farmers, who ended up on the losing end of the dizzying drop in soybean prices precipitated by the exchange's emergency order. Soybeans for July delivery settled Friday at $ 7.03 -LCB- a bushel, 22 -LCB- cents below the settlement price on Tuesday before the exchange issued its directive, and 63 cents below the previous Friday's final price. `` They feel they've been betrayed by the exchange,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Merritt </PERSON>, research director for <ORGANIZATION> Merchants </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trading </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> futures brokerage with a large farmer clientele. Some of the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>'s own members _ many of them pure speculators who make their living forecasting the movements of the free market _ also feel cheated by the edict. Regardless of whether the Italian concern <ORGANIZATION> Ferruzzi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finanziara </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SpA </ORGANIZATION> was trying to corner the soybean market, critics say, directors of the exchange should have let the market sort itself out. But the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> says that would have been even more troublesome, that with too few soybeans of acceptable quality available to satisfy outstanding contracts, there would have been defaults and chaos in the marketplace. The exchange says it is only doing its government-authorized job of ensuring order in a market of global importance, thereby protecting the public's interest. A federal judge in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> agreed on Thursday by denying <ORGANIZATION> Ferruzzi </ORGANIZATION>'s bid to block the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>'s directive `` If I grant a temporary restraining order in this case and it turns out to be a mistake ... a loss of confidence in the market could be a consequence,'' said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Zagel </PERSON>. An investigation appears to be inevitable. And the century-old debate revived by the flap _ whether agricultural futures markets are legitimate marketing tools or gambling casinos _ will rage on. That's nothing new for the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>. The 141-year history of the world's oldest and largest futures exchange is strewn with scandals, squeezes, corners and attempts to crush them. When the dust clears, predicts <PERSON> Merton </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> finance professor and an expert on futures markets, the Board of Trade will still be standing. `` A lot of people may not like it but, as the saying goes, it's the only wheel in town,'' he said `` If you're in the soybean business, what else are you going to do?''

<HEAD>Profit Reports Stand As Next Hurdle for Rising Stock Market</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Wall Street analysts are waiting with some trepidation for the second-quarter earnings reports due to be issued by hundreds of companies over the next few weeks. The profit figures are expected to provide some of the first hard-and-fast signs of the impact a slowing economy is likely to have on businesses' bottom lines. By all the evidence so far, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>'s efforts to restrain economic growth began to take hold in earnest in the April-June period. Investors have had ample chance to brace themselves lately for the likelihood that earnings reports are n't going to be as impressive as they have been over the past couple of years. To cite a prominent example among the industries whose earnings are closely tied to the business cycle, auto stocks have been weak for some time as it became increasingly apparent that cars and truck sales were slumping. Still, many observers wonder how well prepared the market, which hit new highs this past week since the 1987 crash, might be for any significant and widespread earnings setbacks. `` In this cycle, stocks may have waited to fall in the face of earnings disappointments, rather than in anticipation of them,'' said <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerschner </PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION> PaineWebber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The question goes beyond whether results for the second quarter itself measure up to expectations. If profit growth has indeed passed its peak and is starting down, many analysts will be scrutinizing the current figures to try to gauge how much they should revise projections for the third quarter and beyond. `` We expect that modest disappointments in the cyclical industries will evoke major earnings estimate reductions,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Connolly </PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` Analysts will seize the opportunity to get their estimates down at this very convenient juncture. `` Of greatest interest will be the reaction of cyclical stock prices,'' <PERSON> Connolly </PERSON> added. `` At best they will be neutral -LRB- compared with -RRB- the general market. The other possibility is that they could tumble.'' Such talk did n't deter investors from bidding enthusiastically for stocks in the past week. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials climbed 66.96 to 2,554.82, on top of a 47.80-point gain the week before. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> composite index rose 3.50 to 185.06; the <ORGANIZATION> NASDAQ </ORGANIZATION> composite index for the over-the-counter market added 6.48 to 448.90, and the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> market value index was up 4.37 at 368.12. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> averaged 160.26 million shares a day, up from 125.86 million a day in the previous week. Corporate earnings reports for the next few quarters may well turn out to be a deciding factor in the debate over Wall Street's popular `` soft landing'' hypothesis Believers in this script argue that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> will be able to slow growth and restrain inflation without causing a recession and an accompanying slide in business profits. But skeptics still regard that as a difficult mission. `` We think chances are that this soft landing will run into a hard rock,'' said <PERSON> Suresh </PERSON> <PERSON> Bhirud </PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION> Oppenheimer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` We were hoping we'd see 5 percent earnings growth next year, but we've had to reduce that estimate.'' At <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION>, chief economist <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Straszheim </PERSON> still projects 5 percent increases in earnings for both this year and next. But he notes that that will contrast sharply with the gains of 20 percent and 35 percent recorded in the past two years. `` Aftertax operating profits, adjusted for inventory and depreciation considerations, are likely to be flat at best over the next two years,'' <PERSON> Straszheim </PERSON> said. `` Slower economic growth is squeezing profits.''

<HEAD>BAT Megabid Could Transform Euro-Takeover Scene</HEAD>
<HEAD>Graphic in AP Access under BRITTAKES</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Look out, <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The debt-financed megabid craze in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> has thundered across the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> with a vengeance in the form of a hostile $ 21 billion offer for leading conglomerate <ORGANIZATION> BAT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, shattering an assumption that the biggest European businesses are immune from attack. Regardless of whether Anglo-French financier Sir <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldsmith </PERSON>'s investor group succeeds in its offer for the British company, the bid has rewritten the rules and could incite a spree of multbillion dollar deals. `` It has sent shivers down the spines of the chief executives of many of our companies,'' says <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Healey </PERSON>, editor of the British publication Acquisitions Monthly. Nonetheless, such large takeovers financed with borrowed money face considerable obstacles in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and elsewhere in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, where the buying and selling of companies historically has been much more conservative and slow-moving than in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Most high-profile American deals have taken the form of a leveraged buyout, in which a would-be buyer puts up almost no cash but borrows the purchase price, pledging the target company's assets as collateral. After the deal is completed, the new owner sells off pieces of the company to repay the debt. Many European investors have doubts about following the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> buyout trend. They are less keen on borrowingly heavily, tend to be more loyal to companies and are more sensitive about post-takeover job losses. Yet, said <PERSON> Johnathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mervis </PERSON>, chief executive of <ORGANIZATION> J.P. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mervis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, an acquisitions adviser, `` Time has moved on and the opposition is not quite as firm as it was.'' The announcement last Tuesday of the BAT bid, which nearly rivals the record $ 25 billion purchase of <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> earlier this year, means that `` in the British takeover scene, the perception has been totally changed. This has really changed the whole ball game,'' <PERSON> Healey </PERSON> said in an interview. `` If they are going to take pot shots at BAT, who else is safe?'' he said. `` There are very few companies safe.'' <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s economy already has been influenced by an acceleration in takeovers, spurred partly by the perception that many companies are undervalued, particularly since the October 1987 stock market crash. The approach of 1992, when <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> becomes a trade-barrier free marketplace of 320 million consumers, also has played a role in the increased number of corporate mergers. Many company strategists see acquisitions as a good way to prepare for an onslaught of competition from inside and outside <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. In addition, a generation of postwar entrepreneurs are now approaching retirement. Many are looking for buyers because their own children are n't interested in running the family business. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> is <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s busiest takeover battlefield _ the number of British deals has quadrupled in the past five years _ because there are more publicly held companies and bidders face fewer corporate defenses and regulatory hurdles than in other European countries. Indeed, <PERSON> Goldsmith </PERSON> chose <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> after becoming disenchanted with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, where competition among dealmakers has squeezed returns and where the most obvious takeover targets have been plucked. According to Acquisitions Monthly, a record 2,241 takeovers of British companies worth 37.6 billion pounds or $ 61.3 billion were completed last year, vs. 1,937 deals worth 27.7 billion pounds or $ 45.2 billion in 1987. Prices soared on <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> this past week on expectations that other British corporate giants would become targets now that the ground has been broken. Shares in other European bourses also jumped. Many British investment strategists say takeover activity has become a strong underpinning for the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> market. `` A lot of people now are seeing the low value of some of our very large and very successful companies,'' <PERSON> Healey </PERSON> said. But others question whether a bonanza for takeover investors is imminent in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. `` I'm not sure that will happen,'' said <PERSON> Mervis </PERSON>. `` I think that it will all settle down.'' Analysts doubted the <PERSON> Goldsmith </PERSON> group could woo BAT's large-scale shareholders with a bid that is 80 percent debt-financed. `` The institutional investors are very hostile to such bids,'' <PERSON> Healey </PERSON> said. BAT Chairman <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheehy </PERSON> described the offer as `` an ill-conceived attempt at destructive financial engineering.'' The bidders, who also include <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> merchant banker <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON> <PERSON> Rothschild </PERSON> and Australian entrepreneur <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Packer </PERSON>, will have to pay a higher price and include some cash to win, analysts said. <PERSON> Goldsmith </PERSON> has said he wants to dismantle BAT by selling off its non-tobacco interests, which include financial services, retailing and paper. But many Europeans fear that breaking up companies can worsen <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s relatively high unemployment. `` Will chief executives be more worried about takeovers than running their companies?'' said <PERSON> Healey </PERSON>. He expressed concern that takeover paranoia could make corporate bosses change basic strategy to the detriment of their companies' long-term futures. For example, they might spend or borrow huge sums to repurchase stock instead using the money for research and investment. `` What might come out later is the political backlash,'' <PERSON> Healey </PERSON> said. `` Is this good for <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> PLC?'' Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s government, although a strong supporter of free market forces, has blocked big takeovers in the past, including the Australian company <ORGANIZATION> Elders </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> IXL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>'s bid for liquor company <ORGANIZATION> Allied-Lyons </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>. But one of two rival bids for <ORGANIZATION> Gateway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a large supermarket operator, is expected to succeed. The British takeover scene has attracted many American participants, including leveraged buyout leader <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roberts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the takeover strategist firm <PERSON> Wasserstein </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Perella </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, and speculator <PERSON> Asher </PERSON> <PERSON> Edelman </PERSON>. In the BAT battle, the <PERSON> Goldsmith </PERSON> group has lined up <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> to help finance its offer, and BAT has enlisted <ORGANIZATION> Goldman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sachs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> for a defensive response.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 BAT and <PERSON> Batman </PERSON> were at the center of two multibillion-dollar takeover deals that took shape on opposite sides of the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION>, one in the City of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and the other in <LOCATION> Gotham </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. Overseas, a group led by British raider Sir <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldsmith </PERSON> made a $ 21.2 billion debt-financed hostile foray for <ORGANIZATION> BAT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, a conglomerate that owns the swank <ORGANIZATION> Saks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fifth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Avenue </ORGANIZATION> chain and makes Kool cigarettes. The offer, which affirms the migration of the American big buyout to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, would amount to the second-largest deal in history behind the $ 25 billion debt-financed takeover of <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> earlier this year. But if the recent history of American hostile takeovers is any indication, this deal will go the way of all others: to court. That's where the protracted tussle over the future of New York-based giants <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> is mired, and a judge on Friday helped clear some of the sludge. Ruling on the side of <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION>'s friendly $ 14 billion offer for <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> _ the entertainment empire reaping big profits from its `` Batman'' film hit _ <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> Chancery Court Judge <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> scuttled for now <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION>'s hostile $ 12.2 billion offer for Time. The judge refused to block Time's $ 70-a-share offer. Paramount, though, appealed the ruling to the <ORGANIZATION> state </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>, where all three companies are incorporated. In <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, BAT and its pursuer, a trio of powerful investors led by <PERSON> Goldsmith </PERSON>, were lining up attorneys for what promises to be a legal extravaganza. Since many BAT subsidiaries are American, the takeover could be decided in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> courts. Earlier this year, a federal judge effectively ended South Africa-controlled <ORGANIZATION> Minorco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SA </ORGANIZATION>'s bid for <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Consolidated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gold </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fields </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> by issuing a retraining order against the acquisition. Besides highly paid investment bankers, the BAT offering would bring two other popular American financial tools to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>: the use of high-yield junk bonds and the dismemberment of a large company. No caped crusader he, <PERSON> Goldsmith </PERSON> says he wants to bust up BAT by selling its non-tobacco interests, which account for about 60 percent of its annual revenue of $ 28.7 billion. In <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, those interests include <ORGANIZATION> Saks </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Marshall </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Field </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Appleton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Papers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farmers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, one of the nation's largest insurers. While the takeover gulf between <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> appears to be narrowing, there's no denying the enormous economic gap between East and West reflected in the BAT and Time capers. As the two deals went their respective routes _ Time in court, BAT heading there _ President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was behind the Iron Curtain offering <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> $ 100 million in aid, a figure that probably wo n't approach the fees for lawyers and investment bankers in the takeover bids In other business news this week: _ One of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s commodities exchanges was back in the public eye but the reason was soybeans, not <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> surveillance The <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> issued an emergency order to curb trading in soybean futures contracts amid rumors an Italian company was trying to corner the market. A federal judge upheld the order but the Italians said they will sue to recover losses. _ More evidence emerged that the economy is contracting Wholesale prices fell 0.1 percent in June, the first drop in 18 months, retail sales fell for the second straight month and the operating rate for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> factories declined, government reports showed. _ Leaders of the world's seven richest democracies gathered in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> during the bicentennial of the French Revolution for their annual economic summit President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> won one victory in a trade dispute but was thwarted in an attempt to engineer a deal to lower <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s debt.

<HEAD>SEC Proposing Changes with World Market In Mind</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN M. DOYLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A proposed rule change in an obscure aspect of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> securities law signals that federal regulators are ready to go global. As the drive toward automated trading and internationally linked markets accelerates, the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> has decided to proceed _ in a toned down version _ with a proposal that would make it easier for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and foreign corporations to raise money through the private sale of securities. It's called Rule 144a, and although <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> officials and industry experts concede it wo n't have much direct effect on the average American, it has generated an enormous amount of interest in the financial community and press. `` I used to call it ` The Satanic Verses' of the securities industry,'' said <PERSON> Sara </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanks </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> official in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. First proposed last October, Rule 144a _ like the controversial <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON> novel _ remained obscure to all but devotees until it was publicly attacked and turned into a hot news story. `` We got some very inflammatory headlines,'' she said. Supporters said it would lower financing costs for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies while enticing foreign corporations, previously discouraged by <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> registration and disclosure requirements, to raise capital here. But critics claimed the rule change would increase the power of large institutional investors, like banks and insurance companies, by eroding the already shrinking public securities markets where investors, big and small, are considered equal. That private market has mushroomed from $ 16 billion or nearly 22 percent of the total securities market in 1980 to about $ 200 billion or almost 43 percent last year, according to <ORGANIZATION> IDD </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, a firm that tracks trends in the financial industry. After some etooling following input from the securities industry and stock exchange officials, the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> voted 5-0 last week to seek additional comment on Rule 144a. The modified version was one of five proposals cleared by the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> last week addressing problems raised by the globalization of financial markets, which has made it easy to trade <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> stocks in <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> and British stocks in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` International markets are increasingly automated and interlinked,'' <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruder </PERSON> told a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee hearing on globalization last month. `` As dramatically illustrated by the October 1987 market break -LRB- the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>'s term for the stock market crash -RRB-, events in one country's securities markets may affect those in other countries. Rule 144a, if approved by the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>, would loosen restraints on the trading in the private placement market, securities that are exempted from <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> registration requirements because they are not offered publicly. The attraction to private offerings is `` as much a question of convenience as anything else,'' said <PERSON> Geoff </PERSON> <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON>, an associate at <ORGANIZATION> IDD </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>. Paperwork for a public offering takes a minimum of two weeks after it gets to the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>, he explained, while in a private offering `` you cut out the whole formality of registering with the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>. There has to be some savings on printing expenses and legal costs.'' But there's a catch. While companies can sell their securities to large investors without the lengthy and expensive disclosure and registration proceedings required in public offerings, the purchaser must hold them for two to three years. That restriction has made privately placed securities unattractive to many large investors, forcing issuers to sell at a discount. Rule 144a would create a `` safe harbor'' from the resale restriction. `` What we're doing here is providing a more liquid market, making it more efficient so it's easier to resell them,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Hanks </PERSON>, chief of the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corporate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION>. In response to earlier comments by top officials from major corporations and investment institutions, the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> staff recommended changes in its initial proposal. They included narrowing the number of institutions allowed to participate and barring securities that already are publicly traded from the registration exemption. `` From what we've read about it, we think its better than the last rule, but whether it's something we completely support, I ca n't say yet,'' said <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Leibler </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> Ms. <PERSON> Hanks </PERSON> noted that the Securities Act of 1933, which Rule 144a would modify slightly, was aimed at protecting investors. `` Our role is to protect investors when they need protecting,'' she said. `` There was clear intent by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that there are some people who just do n't need our protection, the large institutional investors who can fend for themselves.'' <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Finn </PERSON>, chief economist for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dealers </ORGANIZATION>, which oversees over-the-counter stock dealers, agreed that `` large institutions do n't need the protections built into many <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> requirements.'' <PERSON> Finn </PERSON> and <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, agreed that the change would n't hurt small investors although it favors large institutional investors such as banks, mutual funds and insurance companies. `` Little guys invest through these investment funds which are large investors,'' said <PERSON> Finn </PERSON>, adding that the change will `` lower the costs of those financial services. That will indirectly benefit individual investors.'' `` I do n't think it -LRB- Rule 144a -RRB- is going to impinge on the rights of individual investors because it will not necessarilly create a market that will interfere with them,'' <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> said.
