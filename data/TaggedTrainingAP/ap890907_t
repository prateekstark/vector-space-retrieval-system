 Tropical storm-force winds swept the island of <LOCATION> Bermuda </LOCATION> on Thursday, forcing boats to stay in port as a weakened Hurricane <PERSON> Gabrielle </PERSON> approached. Hurricane Felix, meanwhile, dwindled into a tropical storm. <PERSON> Gabrielle </PERSON> was heading due north, with its center passing about 300 miles east of <LOCATION> Bermuda </LOCATION> late Thursday, forecasters said. The hurricane's winds weakened earlier in the day from 135 mph to 105 mph, but then rose by 10:30 p.m. EDT to 110 mph. Little change in strength was expected for <PERSON> Gabrielle </PERSON> as it headed towards Tropical Storm Felix. `` The winds wo n't change much until it reaches cooler waters,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheets </PERSON>, director of the National Hurricane Center. Swells in <LOCATION> Bermuda </LOCATION>'s harbors were reported at 10 feet, and the island's eastern tip reported swells of 15 to 20 feet. The high seas, combined with winds of 30 to 35 mph, prevented any seagoing traffic around the island. Otherwise, <LOCATION> Bermuda </LOCATION>'s residents were making few preparations for the storm, Sheets said. Strong winds stretched as far as 1,000 miles from <PERSON> Gabrielle </PERSON>'s center, reaching the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> `` A ship 60 miles off the coast of <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> reported seeing 12 - to 15-foot seas,'' Sheets said High seas were also reported off the coast of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>. At 10:30 p.m. EDT Thursday, Hurricane <PERSON> Gabrielle </PERSON> was centered near 32.6 degrees north latitude and 59.6 degrees west longitude, or 310 miles east of <LOCATION> Bermuda </LOCATION>. It was traveling north at nearly 17 mph. <PERSON> Felix </PERSON> was downgraded from a hurricane to a tropical storm earlier Thursday as it continued to weaken. The tropical storm posed no threat to land on its northward trek. Forecasters expect <PERSON> Felix </PERSON> to turn toward the northwest and become engulfed in the larger <PERSON> Gabrielle </PERSON> system. <PERSON> Felix </PERSON> is traveling northward at 7 mph with winds of 60 mph. At 10:30 p.m. EDT Thursday, <PERSON> Felix </PERSON> was located near 41.0 degrees north latitude and 48.5 degrees west longitude, or about 450 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Race </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Newfoundland </LOCATION>, in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Felix </PERSON> was the sixth and <PERSON> Gabrielle </PERSON> the seventh named storms of the 1989 Atlantic hurricane season. Storms are named when their winds reach 39 mph, and are classified as hurricanes when they grow to 74 mph.

 A smoky fire touched off by a welder's torch raced through a new casino under construction Thursday at the <LOCATION> Riviera </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hotel </LOCATION> and Casino, forcing the evacuation of at least 3,000 gamblers and guests. Only two minor injuries were reported in the 10:20 a.m. blaze, which burned curtains and broke windows in up to 75 rooms in the hotel before being stopped by automatic sprinklers. Damage was estimated at about $ 3.5 million. Gamblers and guests were evacuated without incident when smoke began filling the inside of the resort. The hotel patrons joined several thousand spectators on the Strip watching the fire, which was put out in about two hours. `` The first thing we did was secure all of the money -LRB- in the casino -RRB- and evacuate all the people,'' hotel President <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Sterbens </PERSON> said. `` To my knowledge it's the first time we've ever shut down gambling at the <LOCATION> Riviera </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Waltzman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Riviera </LOCATION> chairman, said he went floor to floor with security officers, knocking on doors to alert hotel guests as corridors filled with smoke. `` Everything worked the way it was supposed to work,'' <PERSON> Waltzman </PERSON> said of the hotel's sprinkler and fire alarm systems. The casino, which suffered water damage, reopened about 9 p.m. Thursday, and a performance by <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Anka </PERSON> was delayed until 10 p.m. Hotel officials invited all guests to a free prime rib buffet and offered them free tickets to <PERSON> Anka </PERSON>'s performance. The fire blackened the exterior of a section of the original hotel's nine-story structure built in 1953. The fire reached inside 50 to 75 rooms in the building, fire officials said, before being stopped by automatic sprinklers. The fire began in wooden forms being used to build a new 125,000 square-foot two-story casino touted as the world's largest. The blaze also spread to the eaves of an existing casino area and burned part of an outdoor sign on the casino. Embers fanned by 25 mph winds also crossed the street and briefly set the roof of a motel on fire. Two other high-rises at the <LOCATION> Riviera </LOCATION>, where most of the hotel's rooms are located, were not affected by the fire but were evacuated anyway <ORGANIZATION> Clark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Leinbach </PERSON> said the blaze was touched off by welders who were building a swimming pool on top of the new casino. <PERSON> Leinbach </PERSON> said firefighters later found two empty fire extinguishers nearby. <PERSON> Sterbens </PERSON> said the hotel's 2,200 rooms were sold out. The hotel is hosting a convention of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Spinal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cord </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Injury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nurses </ORGANIZATION> and Psychologists. <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> enacted some of the most stringent fire safety codes in the nation after a fire at the former MGM Grand Hotel in November of 1980 killed 87 people and a blaze at the Las Vegas Hilton three months later killed eight people.

<DATELINE>HOT SPRINGS, Ark. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Hot Springs has an army of silver-haired ambassadors who love to brag about mineral springs, pure air and cheap living in the <LOCATION> Ouachita </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION>. When a prospective senior settler calls the <ORGANIZATION> Greater </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hot </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Springs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce-run </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Retiree </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Recruitment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, coordinator <PERSON> Gail </PERSON> <PERSON> Ezelle </PERSON> unleashes the 150-strong force of volunteers whose enthusiasm bubbles like this resort's hot spring water. Dapper in matching blue blazers, breast pockets adorned with their names and the city logo, the volunteers court potential new neighbors with answers about health care, expenses, and recreation. They escort guests up the 216-foot Hot Springs Mountain Tower for a panoramic view, then head downtown for a look at restored Bathhouse Row. The leisurely tour may end with a meal, or maybe a sunset cruise aboard a <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hamilton </LOCATION> party barge. The personal pitches have been potent. The office has fielded more than 6,500 inquiries since it started advertising nationally last summer; it takes credit for 75 moves. Part of its success comes from a 1987 Rand-McNally study listing Hot Sprngs as the nation's third most desirable retirement spot, after the <LOCATION> Murray-Kentucky </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Clayton-Clarksville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, areas To Mrs. <PERSON> Ezelle </PERSON>, 55, who moved from <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, recruiting retirees is just like recruiting an industry. `` They have such a tremendous economic impact on the community, and they give us expertise and enthusiasm.'' But retirees do n't bring some of industry's bothersome baggage: pollution, clogged highways and fluctuating workforces. They arrive with average assets of $ 215,000 and average annual incomes of $ 33,000, along with taxes and spare time to devote to community activities. That equates to an annual economic impact of more than $ 9 million, the office estimates. Mrs. <PERSON> Ezelle </PERSON> praises her volunteer corps, who buy their own jackets, pay for their own gas and provide any extras, such as lake cruises or meals. She offers a toll-free telephone line and complimentary passes to the mountain tower. Aggressive retiree recruitment is nothing new. But Hot Springs is innovating by applying the concept to an existing city instead of a carefully planned senior citizens development, said aging expert <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Longino </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> `` <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> has been a nice place for people to retire for a long time, so they have a tradition up there,'' said <PERSON> Longino </PERSON>, associate director of the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Adult </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> and Aging at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION>. `` But the difference with <LOCATION> Hot </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION> is they are really going after the retirees, instead of letting the retirees come to them. States have to kind of compete for retirees. They bring expendable income and lots of advantages. And older people rarely move someplace where they do n't know anybody.'' That's why volunteers like <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> and <PERSON> Marge </PERSON> <PERSON> Bingham </PERSON> are valuable _ they know what it's like to downshift from a fast-paced working lifestyle. The <ORGANIZATION> Binghams </ORGANIZATION> moved to <LOCATION> Hot </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION> in 1987 from <LOCATION> Covina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, their home for more than three decades. <PERSON> Dick </PERSON>, 57, knew it was time to get out when his 28-minute commute to a securities office turned into a 1 -LCB- - hour headache They were familiar with <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> because their daughter and grandchildren live in <LOCATION> Mena </LOCATION>, on the state's western edge. A deal on a lake house clinched the decision. And once <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> unwound after three months of relaxation, he decided to tell others about <LOCATION> Hot </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Marge </PERSON>, 53, says she was floored by friendliness. `` Out in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, it was so huge and impersonal. We maybe knew our neighbors across the street and on either side of us. But here, we've already got 50 to 100 close friends, and 500 speaking acquaintances. I love it.'' <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Bingham </PERSON> likes to end a recruiting session by inviting guests onto his party barge, docked a few yards behind his home on <PERSON> Lake </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>. He doffs the blazer, kicks back and steers the vessel toward the setting sun. <PERSON> Marge </PERSON> waves to a passing dinner cruise boat; two dozen strangers wave back. `` See what I mean? Everybody's friendly. Heck, in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, if a guy raises his hand like that, he may have a gun in it.'' The office generally refrains from bashing other states, but proudly displayed is a map showing states generating the most inquiries this year shaded in blue. In descending order, they are <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> -LRB- 400 calls -RRB-; <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> -LRB- 314 -RRB-; <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> -LRB- 291 -RRB-; <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> -LRB- 265 -RRB-; and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> -LRB- 221 -RRB-.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s most eligible bachelor, Crown Prince <PERSON> Naruhito </PERSON>, is looking for a bride, but the heir to the Chrysanthemum Throne has discovered it's not easy finding a woman both willing and suited to marry into the world's oldest royal family. Four years ago, upon his return from postgraduate history studies at <ORGANIZATION> Oxford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Merton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, the prince said he would like to marry by age 30, a milestone he reaches in February. But few palace watchers expect the prince to achieve that goal, despite his obvious assets _ he's the eldest son of Emperor <PERSON> Akihito </PERSON>, has an excellent education, and enjoys foreign travel. Women who appreciate culture might be interested in knowing he plays the viola. For sporty types, the prince is an avid mountain climber and enjoys tennis. `` We are trying to realize -LRB- his marriage -RRB- as soon as possible, but have not yet reached the point where we can speak of any particulars,'' <PERSON> Iwao </PERSON> <PERSON> Miyao </PERSON>, deputy head of the <ORGANIZATION> Imperial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Household </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, told a parliamentary committee Aug. 29. <PERSON> Miyao </PERSON>'s comment on <PERSON> Naruhito </PERSON>'s nuptial difficulties was prompted by news a few days earlier that <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> <PERSON> Aya </PERSON>, <PERSON> Naruhito </PERSON>'s younger brother, was engaged and likely to marry first. The idea of 23-year-old Aya, second in line to the throne, marrying before his elder brother was met with considerable opposition from palace conservatives, one palace source said. `` But the crown prince seems to be in no hurry, and has n't found the right woman yet,'' the source said, requesting anonymity. A formal palace announcement on <PERSON> Aya </PERSON>'s engagement will be made after it is approved by the 10-member <ORGANIZATION> Imperial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, headed by Prime Minister <PERSON> Toshiki </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaifu </PERSON>. It is scheduled to meet Sept. 12. Qualifications for women marrying into the imperial family have eased in recent years, but candidates still can expect their family histories and personal backgrounds to be thoroughly checked by both the palace and the media. Newspapers dug up high school album photographs of <PERSON> Kiko </PERSON> <PERSON> Kawashima </PERSON> and even published diagrams of her family tree, complete with detailed profiles going back four generations when it was discovered she will marry Aya. Miss <PERSON> Kawashima </PERSON> comes from a good, but common, family, they said. Her father is a professor of economics at <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Gakushuin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, the alma mater of much of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s royalty. She has lived in <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Because <PERSON> Naruhito </PERSON>'s wife will become empress, his choice will be subject to much closer scrutiny. Descendants of prewar nobility or daughters of leading industrialists are preferred in prospective princesses, though these qualifications are not ironclad. A clean bill of health, however, is a must, as is Japanese citizenship. Some experience living abroad, or ability in a foreign language, is also seen as a plus, since members of the imperial household often are hosts to foreign dignitaries. Attention has focused on three women singled out by the media as possible mates for <PERSON> Naruhito </PERSON>: <PERSON> Mari </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatano </PERSON>, 23, fluent in French and English, and a student in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, where she lives with her parents; <PERSON> Masako </PERSON> <PERSON> Owada </PERSON>, the 25-year-old daughter of a diplomat and a student in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>; and <PERSON> Teruko </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuni </PERSON>, 25, a cousin of the prince. But many palace watchers suspect the prince's final choice will come as a surprise. `` The crown prince has a very clear idea of the kind of woman he wants to marry, and he is too stubborn to just accept whomever the palace chooses, which was how things used to be done,'' said <PERSON> Toshiaki </PERSON> <PERSON> Kawahara </PERSON>, a journalist who has written several books on <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s imperial family. <PERSON> Kawahara </PERSON> said the tradition-minded, strictly regimented life of the <LOCATION> Japanese </LOCATION> royal family has frightened away women reared in the relatively open atmosphere of modern <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. `` Before Empress <PERSON> Michiko </PERSON> married the emperor, she had to go through hours of ` princess studies' every day for three months,'' he said. `` And because she was not of noble heritage, she had to endure a good deal of bullying from the old nobility. Her precedent may scare off other women who could marry into the imperial household.'' <PERSON> Michiko </PERSON>, the daughter of a wealthy businessman, is the first commoner to become empress of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. She wed <PERSON> Akihito </PERSON> in 1959, when he was crown prince, and is credited with shrinking the gap known as the Chrysanthemum Curtain between the public and palace.

 Psychiatrists and psychologists at <LOCATION> Hartgrove </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> bristle at being called modern-day exorcists, but they're creating one of the nation's first treatment programs to wean teen-agers from Satanism `` In no way are we comparable to the old exorcists,'' says <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON>, an adolescent psychologist at the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Side </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> hospital </ORGANIZATION>, which plans to begin offering the program this month. `` The kids who will be admitted will be here primarily because of their behavioral and emotional problems. No one will be hospitalized for strange beliefs or unusual values that we would disagree with,'' <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON> said Wednesday. `` I do n't think there is any doubt Satanism is a growing problem,'' said social worker <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Trahan </PERSON>, who has been researching satanic beliefs for three years and was contracted to organize the program for <PERSON> Hartgrove </PERSON>'s new Center for the Treatment of Ritualistic Deviance. `` We do n't know the percentages because so much is secretive, but we do know ... it is beginning to show up throughout the country,'' <PERSON> Trahan </PERSON> said. More such programs will be needed as police, teachers and parents learn to recognize involvement, said <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Simandl </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> police youth officer and expert on satanic cults, who has helped train Hartgrove staff. `` That's been the problem. There are n't places to take the kids,'' <PERSON> Simandl </PERSON> said. In the program, teen-agers will spend four to eight weeks as in-patients and undergo individual and group counseling. Most of the youths will be admitted voluntarily. <PERSON> Hartgrove </PERSON>'s facility _ to be staffed by specially trained psychiatrists, psychologists, social workers and nurses _ should receive its first patients in two to four weeks, and initially will take as many as six patients at a time, <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON> said. A similar program exists at <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Bethesda </LOCATION> PsychHealth. The new program will seek to undermine Satanism's underlying belief system, which hampers conventional treatment. Satanism `` gives them the promise of power and privilege beyond anything they ever imagined. Not only can they have everything they want ... but can do so while totally indulging themselves in drugs, sex or any momentary pleasure,'' <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON> said. `` We try to help them see how unrealistic the promises are. Our ultimate goal is to make them able to function in the world so they can have a reasonable and successful life for themselves and not harm anyone else.'' Youngsters involved in Satanism often exhibit unusual behavior, which can include suicide attempts, violent rages, rejection of family, drug use, sexual promiscuity, a drastic drop in grades, intensified rebellion, a strong interest in heavy-metal music, role-playing games or horror films, and the use of occult symbols such as `` 666'' or upside-down crosses, <PERSON> Trahan </PERSON> said. `` They usually are intelligent, creative and bored with traditional pursuits. They generally have a feeling of being different and not belonging, are often underachievers and generally have a feeling of being powerless,'' he said. `` One of the problems is helping people see and diagnose the problem,'' <PERSON> Trahan </PERSON> said. `` Often people with a little bit of knowledge think they see it everywhere and think if a kid is into heavy-metal music he must be a Satanist, but that's not true.''

 A 12-year-old boy was arrested in connection with the fatal stabbing of an elementary school teacher, police said Wednesday. The boy, whose name was not released because of his age, was being held at <ORGANIZATION> Tarrant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Juvenile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Detention </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, police said, but it was not known when he would be formally charged. The body of <PERSON> Jana </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON>, 24, was found on stairs outside her classroom at <ORGANIZATION> Glen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> on Aug. 28. She had been stabbed several times in the chest, neck and head. Her purse was untouched and she did not appear to have been sexually assaulted. Police said the boy has admitted he was prowling around the schoolgrounds when Ms. <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> was killed and he has given other details about the crime. Police spokesman <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Clarke </PERSON> on Wednesday night stopped short of calling the boy's statement a confession. `` We feel real confident that we'll have a good case on it,'' <PERSON> Clarke </PERSON> said. `` We really do n't have a motive. We feel like she was just in the wrong place at the wrong time.'' Immediately after the slaying, police said they were looking for a teen-ager who was seen in the area.

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> assembly plants, back in operation after winning a three-week labor dispute, have blazed the trail for other companies to fight the extraordinary power labor unions hold in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, industry spokesmen say. A union power struggle that shut down 15 American plants known as maquiladoras in the border city of <LOCATION> Reynosa </LOCATION> ended with labor and government officials agreeing Aug. 18 to let the workers form a union independent of the nationally powerful <ORGANIZATION> Mexican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> whose local representative forced the workers to strike. `` It definitely means that companies can take a stand against illegal activities and corruption and be successsul,'' said <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, manager for <ORGANIZATION> Reynosa </ORGANIZATION>'s West Bend plant. `` We blazed a new trail.'' The strike was settled after intervention of President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON>'s government in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> has made clear he will not let unions stand in the way of his goal of modernizing the Mexican economy and attracting more foreign investors. `` The <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> government has acted in a certain direction to remove as much of the corruption as it possibly can,'' said <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Kezsbom </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York-based </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> whose <LOCATION> Reynosa </LOCATION> plant was closed in the strike. `` He does n't want to have the negative publicity that occurred out of this permeate throughout the world. The issue was the expansion of the maquiladora industry in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>.'' Maquiladoras, in which foreign-owned companies take advantage of cheap Mexican labor to produce goods for sale in their own countries or elsewhere, have become a top foreign income earner for <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. The industry, which generated $ 2.3 billion in foreign currency last year, has grown by more than 70 percent since 1985 and employs about 392,000 people, mainly along the U.S.-Mexican border. The strike cost an estimated $ 500,000 a day in lost production, but plant managers said it was worth it because the outcome was favorable to them. Although the plant workers indicated no great sympathy for a walkout, they went on strike July 25 on the orders of <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON> <PERSON> Morales </PERSON>, a local leader of the powerful <ORGANIZATION> Mexican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION>. Strike flags were hoisted. Traditionally in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, workers who violate strike flags face severe consequences, including possible physical harm, immediately or later. The plants, nevertheless, continued to pay the workers their wages and benefits, averaging about $ 1.20 a hour, during the strike. <PERSON> Kezsbom </PERSON> said the American managers resisted <PERSON> Morales </PERSON>, who controls most of the labor contracts at <LOCATION> Reynosa </LOCATION>'s 27 other maquiladoras, because they considered him corrupt. <PERSON> Morales </PERSON> forced companies to give him control of trucking contracts, waste disposal and scrap resale, and to issue food coupons good only at stores he controls. The coupons are part of the employee benefit packages. The nearly 2,000 workers at the plants <PERSON> Morales </PERSON> shut down waited for two weeks while plant managers and business leaders pleaded with the federal government in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> to step in. Then, frustrated by government inaction, about 900 workers ripped down the strike flags, stormed back into their plants and went to work. That same day <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Gutierrez </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrios </PERSON> met with industry leaders in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and promised the government would intervene. Gov. <PERSON> Americo </PERSON> <PERSON> Villarreal </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tamaulipas </LOCATION> summoned the managers to a meeting in the state capital, <LOCATION> Ciudad </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Victoria </LOCATION>, the next day to work out an accord giving the plant workers the right to form an independent union. The agreement surprised those familiar with the strength of the <ORGANIZATION> Mexican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's largest labor organization and a powerful sector of the governing <ORGANIZATION> Institutional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. Although the agreement stipulates that only workers from the affected 15 plants can join the independent union, industry spokesmen say it may open a new era of labor relations in <LOCATION> Tamaulipas </LOCATION> and other Mexican states with maquiladora plants.

 A spokesman for former Philippine President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> quit his job and returned to <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> on Wednesday, giving up his appeal for political asylum in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> `` Gemmo'' <LOCATION> Trinidad </LOCATION>, 45, was media spokesman since shortly after <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> was exiled here in February 1986. <LOCATION> Trinidad </LOCATION> left <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> for <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> early Wednesday, after visiting his parents and son in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Trinidad </LOCATION> entered the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in March 1986 on a tourist visa. After the Immigration and <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> began deportation proceedings against him last January for overstaying the visa, <LOCATION> Trinidad </LOCATION> applied for political asylum, claiming his life would be in danger in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> now that <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> foe <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> is president. A hearing on the appeal was scheduled for later this month. Although he still fears persecution, <LOCATION> Trinidad </LOCATION> said personal problems, including a recent divorce, prompted his decision to go home. `` I believe the emotional problems caused by the divorce have caused me to be less effective as spokesman,'' he said. `` I'm still a bit apprehensive about what will greet me, but if I get arrested, it will help my colleagues.'' Several other <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> aides seek political asylum here. <LOCATION> Trinidad </LOCATION> was married in 1978 and divorced last January. His ex-wife, <PERSON> Norma </PERSON>, will remain in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, as will their 8 -LCB- - year-old son, <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Reynaldo </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Trinidad </LOCATION> said <PERSON> Tomas </PERSON> `` Buddy'' <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> consul general here, called <LOCATION> Trinidad </LOCATION>'s fears of persecution `` preposterous'' and said many <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> allies prosper in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Trinidad </LOCATION> said he would work for an export company in <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>, as well as write a twice-monthly column for a Filipino newspaper in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. He's also working on a book detailing his years with the Marcoses. Near the end of <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' 20-year rule, <LOCATION> Trinidad </LOCATION> was a regional director in the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Settlements </ORGANIZATION>, then headed by <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' wife, <PERSON> Imelda </PERSON>. The Marcoses are under <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> indictment for allegedly stealing nearly $ 200 million from their homeland and stashing it in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government has filed a companion civil lawsuit, so that claims against them can continue if the 71-year-old <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> dies. He has been hospitalized here for the past eight months and remained in critical condition Wednesday. Although Mrs. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> has said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> governments' freeze on many of the couple's vast assets made it difficult to pay bills, <LOCATION> Trinidad </LOCATION> said he got a regular `` allowance'' and money played no part in his decision. Mrs. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> downplayed reports that <LOCATION> Trinidad </LOCATION> left because of increasing tension between him and other members of the <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> entourage, including <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> `` Gemmo is a good guy,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>. `` He can always come back and he still has my trust.'' His attorney, <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Oldenburg </PERSON>, said <LOCATION> Trinidad </LOCATION> withdrew the application for political asylum Tuesday and the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> granted him a voluntary departure order, meaning the deportation proceedings would be suspended. The <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> said <LOCATION> Trinidad </LOCATION> could apply for a new visa if he wants to return to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.

 The conviction of a billionaire drug kingpin whose arrest in his native <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> sparked a week of riots there is a big victory in the war on drugs, federal prosecutors said. Jurors on Wednesday found <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramon </PERSON> <PERSON> Matta </PERSON> <PERSON> Ballesteros </PERSON> guilty of masterminding a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> drug ring linked to a Colombian cocaine cartel. After the conviction, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Feess </PERSON> described the 45-year-old <PERSON> Matta </PERSON> as `` one of the most significant narcotics traffickers in the world today.'' Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Gurule </PERSON> said the federal court jury's decision was a message to the <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> government `` that if they extradite drug kingpins we will prosecute them to the full extent of the law.'' <PERSON> Matta </PERSON> could be sentenced to life imprisonment without possibility of parole, <PERSON> Feess </PERSON> said. Sentencing is scheduled for Oct. 5. <PERSON> Matta </PERSON> led a powerful cocaine cartel based in <LOCATION> Cali </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, that funneled thousands of pounds of the drug to <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> through <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Feess </PERSON> said. He compared <PERSON> Matta </PERSON>'s power to that of <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivas </PERSON>, the Colombian drug lord convicted earlier this year in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. `` The conviction of <LOCATION> Ballesteros </LOCATION> is a major blow to the gangsters who run the international drug rings,'' Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said in a statement from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The jury convicted <PERSON> Matta </PERSON> on one count each of conspiracy, running a continuing criminal enterprise and possession with intent to distribute cocaine and four counts of distribution of cocaine. <PERSON> Matta </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Stolar </PERSON>, said he will file motions to have the verdict overturned and, failing that, will appeal. He insisted that the case was prejudiced by publicity surrounding the U.S.-Colombian anti-drug campaign and President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s speech Tuesday night. <PERSON> Stolar </PERSON> said he asked <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to delay his address but received no response. He maintained that <PERSON> Matta </PERSON> was a legitimate businessman and <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>' largest single employer. He said <PERSON> Matta </PERSON>'s fortune came from cattle ranching, construction and the tobacco, coffee and spice trade. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, however, said <PERSON> Matta </PERSON> controlled a narcotics empire worth up to $ 2 billion. He was accused of overseeing a network that distributed $ 72 million worth of cocaine in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. The case against <PERSON> Matta </PERSON> stemmed from a September 1981 raid on a Van Nuys apartment complex, where $ 1.9 million in cash and 114 pounds of cocaine were sezied. At that time, that was the largest seizure of cocaine in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> history. <PERSON> Matta </PERSON> became a folk hero to his impoverished neighbors in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> where he granted loans, bought desks for school children and employed about 800 people on his tobacco and dairy farms. His extradition triggered outrage in <LOCATION> Tegucigalpa </LOCATION> where 2,000 demonstrators burned the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy annex. Five Hondurans died in the week-long violence.

 A man who had been following actress <PERSON> Justine </PERSON> <PERSON> Bateman </PERSON>, former star of the television series `` Family Ties,'' was arrested Wednesday after threatening suicide at a theater where she was appearing, police said. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Smetek </PERSON>, 39, was taken into custody about three hours after he appeared outside the <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION> Repertory Theater holding a loaded revolver to his abdomen, said police Lt. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Peters </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bateman </PERSON>, 23, best known for her television role as <PERSON> Mallory </PERSON> <PERSON> Keaton </PERSON>, appeared in the title role of the theater's production of `` Lulu'' at its premiere Wednesday night. <PERSON> Smetek </PERSON>, who will undergo a psychiatric evaluation at <LOCATION> Highland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, had been trailing <PERSON> Bateman </PERSON> for months and maintained that the two shared an intimate relationship, <PERSON> Peters </PERSON> said. `` He just wants to talk with her and indicate his love-fixation with her,'' <PERSON> Peters </PERSON> said. Theater workers first noticed Smetek about 10 a.m. sitting on a bench in the theater's courtyard. He was holding a .22 - caliber Magnum revolver to his chest, said <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION> Rep spokesman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> Another theater worker told police <PERSON> Smetek </PERSON> threatened to kill himself. A team of about 10 police officers and mental health officials negotiating with <PERSON> Smetek </PERSON> persuaded to take the cocked gun away from his abdomen and tuck it in his waistband, said <PERSON> Peters </PERSON>. At about 12:30 p.m., <PERSON> Smetek </PERSON> surrendered to authorities without incident, <PERSON> Peters </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Smetek </PERSON> was taken to the <ORGANIZATION> Hall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION>, where investigators arrested him for investigation of possession of a loaded firearm within city limits and two felony counts of displaying a firearm. They were reviewing <PERSON> Smetek </PERSON>'s criminal record and also considering a possible harassment charge, <PERSON> Peters </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bateman </PERSON>'s concern about <PERSON> Smetek </PERSON> was raised following two incidents, which were not described, on the `` Family Ties'' set at <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studios </ORGANIZATION> earlier this year, said the actress' publicist, <PERSON> Cindy </PERSON> <PERSON> Guagenti </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> Justine </PERSON> was aware that he was pursuing her and took the situation seriously,'' said <PERSON> Guagenti </PERSON>. `` She contacted the police in <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION> when she found out he was up there. And she hired a private security firm.'' <PERSON> Bateman </PERSON> and theater officials said a temporary restraining order against <PERSON> Smetek </PERSON> is scheduled to take effect Thursday. The slaying of actress <PERSON> Rebecca </PERSON> <PERSON> Schaeffer </PERSON> on July 18, allegedly by an obsessed fan, has heightened celebrities' uneasiness about mentally unstable fans.

 The governing party suffered its worst election setback in 41 years of power on Wednesday, losing nearly a quarter of its parliamentary seats to far-right and anti-apartheid rivals. Riot squads with whips, tear gas and shotguns dispersed blacks protesting their exclusion from the balloting, and police said more than 50 people were arrested. Anti-apartheid leaders, who called a general strike, said 3 million people stayed away from jobs and classes. It appeared, with just four of 166 districts undecided, that the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> would retain 93 or 94 of its previous 123 seats. The far-right <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> improved from 22 to 39 seats and the liberal <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> moved from 20 to 33 seats, the most ever for an anti-apartheid faction. With his party narrowly retaining its majority in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader and acting President F.W. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> is expected to be chosen by an electoral college next week to serve a five-year term as president. He described the results as `` a clear mandate'' for his party's plans for gradual political reform and contended that both opposition parties had little chance for further growth Independent commentators said it was the first time since 1953 that the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> failed to get a majority of the popular vote. The Nationalists won about 48 percent of the vote, to 31 percent for the Conservatives and 21 percent for the Democrats. About 69 percent of the 3,160,667 registered white voters turned out for the election. The Conservatives, who favor stricter racial segregation, lost by just five votes in <LOCATION> Vereeniging </LOCATION>, former district of <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON>, who was not a parliamentary candidate. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Pik </PERSON> <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> and Defense Minister <PERSON> Magnus </PERSON> <PERSON> Malan </PERSON> were re-elected by margins sharply lower than in the white election of 1987. The Conservatives won their first-ever seats in <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION>, the capital, and in <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Province </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Orange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>. The election was widely viewed as among the most important in history for the whites who control <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. It gave white voters the choice of stating that they want to strengthen apartheid, eliminate it or take a middle course. The amount of support for the other parties was expected to influence the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in deciding whether to speed up or slow down its program of limited political reform. Voting stations around the country were heavily guarded. Armored vehicles patrolled some mixed-race townships, which were enveloped in smoke from burning street barricades. Also at stake were seats in mixed-race and Indian chambers, which were established in 1984 and have little power. Blacks, who outnumber whites more than 5-1, have no voice in national affairs. Anti-apartheid activists called for a boycott of the non-white elections. Of the nation's 37 million people, 5 million are white, 28 million black, about 3 million of mixed race and nearly 1 million of Indian descent. The campaign platform of de Klerk called for limited black participation at the national level within five years. He is depicted as more flexible than his predecessor, President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>, but supports segregation of schools and neighborhoods and rejects a one-person, one-vote system leading to black majority rule. The <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> opposes political concessions to blacks and favors comprehensive racial segregation. The <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> wants an immediate end to segregation and a vote of equal weight for every South African. In the five weeks before the election, anti-apartheid groups mounted an unprecedented defiance campaign, in many cases provoking violent response by police. Riot squads have used shotguns, water cannons, tear gas, clubs and dogs against anti-election marches, campus rallies and church meetings. More than 2,000 people have been arrested for disobeying laws that segregate hospitals, beaches and buses, and for defying restrictions on speech and political activity. <PERSON> Desmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON>, the black Anglican archbishop and anti-apartheid leader, said of the election: `` I'm not paying a great deal of attention. I'm more interested in how many people stay away. `` I would hope that white South Africans would be aware that the bulk of the people in this country are not voting, and they should join us in getting rid of the system.'' Black worker absenteeism ranged from about 70 percent in the industrial heartland around <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> to virtually 100 percent in the eastern <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> province cities of <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Elizabeth </LOCATION> and Uitenhage, labor experts at <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witwatersrand </ORGANIZATION> reported. Most mines operated normally, but all motor vehicle plants were shut down. Officials said registered voters included 665,870 Indians and 1.77 million people of mixed race.

 The addict slips the needle into his scarred arm and drives down the plunger, or flares a crack-filled pipe and inhales the heated vapor. In both cases, the cocaine hits the brain within seconds, giving the user sensations of pleasure that some have said is like no other high. But the pleasure lasts only 10 to 20 minutes, followed quickly by a `` crash'' and a relentless, ignore-all-else craving to get high again. It's that cycle of ecstasy, depression and renewed craving for euphoria that makes cocaine and crack among the most habit-forming drugs. And, experts say, medical science has not found a treatment that can be applied universally to break the cycle of dependency. `` Cocaine is clearly a very addictive drug because it is the most reinforcing and pleasurable of the abused drugs,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Blaine </PERSON>, chief of the treatment branch at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Abuse </ORGANIZATION>. `` As yet, we do n't have any good, solid research on successful crack or cocaine treatment.'' Both cocaine and crack, a crystallized form of cocaine that is smoked, work directly on the brain. It's believed the drug causes protein molecules called neuroreceptors to ignite sensations of pleasure and send pulses of euphoria along nerve pathways time after time after time. Eventually, the molecules are absorbed and the effects diminish. For the user, there's a letdown and then, quickly, a desire for more of the drug. That, <PERSON> Blaine </PERSON> said, is a cycle of reinforcement that makes cocaine so dangerous. By some estimates, almost half of all cocaine users quickly slip from casual use into an uncontrolled craving. And an even higher percentage of crack users quickly become addicts. `` Crack may be the most euphoric of all the drugs,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kleber </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> researcher who is with the National Drug Control Policy office. `` It is intensely pleasurable. It wears off very quickly and puts the user back to not feeling good. And the body has no barrier to its use.'' Those who inhale powdered cocaine are limited by the amount the nose will absorb, <PERSON> Kleber </PERSON> said, and those who inject the drug eventually run out of veins. But the lungs have a virtually unlimited ability to absorb crack smoke, he said. Success in treating addiction, he said, depends to a large degree on who is being treated. `` Some need only rehabilitation,'' he said. `` Give me an employed -LRB- professional -RRB- and I will have 60 to 70 percent success. In a year, he'll be off the drug.'' But for addicts living in poverty, particularly in the inner city, there are few positive elements to provide an incentive to stay away from cocaine. Drugs in such neighborhoods often are viewed as an industry and an economic opportunity for the young to gain wealth quickly. `` For those in the inner city, you have to address not just the drug, but the whole lifestyle,'' <PERSON> Kleber </PERSON> said. `` First they have to be off the drug. Then they have to get the skills to stay off it.'' That must include medical care, housing, education and vocational training. And `` when they go back into the community there's got to be a strong support system, a drug-free network'' to reinforce the new way of life, he said. Meanwhile, scientists are searching for a medication to help wean addicts from cocaine. `` This is not an area yet where we have good clinical science,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jasinski </PERSON>, chief of a chemical dependency clinic at <ORGANIZATION> Francis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scott </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Key </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, which is affiliated with <ORGANIZATION> Johns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hopkins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>. Finding a cocaine substitute, he said, `` is going to be very important'' in finding the best way to control cocaine. `` Within two or three years, we should have a major medication to help us,'' <PERSON> Kleber </PERSON> said. `` But I ca n't see any of these being a magic bullet'' that will automatically stop the craving or provide an effortless cure. `` It's not going to be that easy,'' he said.

<HEAD>Fungicide Voluntarily Withdrawn Due to Possible Cancer Risk</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A widely used class of fungicides is being taken off the market voluntarily for dozens of crops _ from apples to cucumbers _ because government tests indicate a higher risk of cancer than may be acceptable. The three manufacturers of the fungicide <ORGANIZATION> EBDC </ORGANIZATION> announced Wednesday they are curtailing the use of the chemical `` to maintain public confidence'' in the food products involved. However, they maintained the chemical is safe for consumers if used properly. EBDC, or ethylene bisdithiocarbamate, has been under a special review by the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> since 1987 because a breakdown product from the chemical has been shown to cause cancer in test animals. The agency recently informed the companies of preliminary cancer risk estimates that likely would require curbs on the use of EBDC on some food products, according to agency documents obtained by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. The fungicide has been used for nearly 40 years to combat mildew and mold on more than 70 different food crops including apples, potatoes, tomatoes, sweet corn, onions, mushrooms, carrots, grapes, lettuce and citrus fruits, among others. In a joint announcement the three manufacturers _ the <ORGANIZATION> Du </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Pennwalt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Rohm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Haas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> _ said Wednesday they will discontinue sales of the chemical for use on all but 13 food products. The manufacturers maintained that use of the chemical _ if applied properly _ poses no health concerns, but said `` the theoretical risks'' that are being reviewed by the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> in connection with use on some products `` unnecessarily raises questions about the safety of this entire class of fungicides.'' Such concerns have been heightened since the uproar earlier this year over the pesticide Alar. While the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> did not formally order Alar off the market, its link to cancer and the widespread publicity over its use on apples earlier this year caused the sale of apple products to plummet, costing the apple industry tens of millions of dollars. The manufacturer of Alar subsequently stopped selling the pesticide in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to calm consumer fears. <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kasper </PERSON> confirmed that the agency is preparing to announce some curbs on the use of EBDC because of the latest cancer risk data on some food crops. `` We've got some risk estimates that we're concerned about,'' said <PERSON> Kasper </PERSON>. He said the agency will review the voluntary withdrawal of the chemical for some foods and determine whether that is adequate. But, according to <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> documents, agency tests show that the cancer risks posed by <ORGANIZATION> EBDC </ORGANIZATION> residues on some foods were many times the one in 1 million level the agency uses to indicate negligible risk. In the case of tomatoes the risk was found to be 63 times the one-in-a-million risk level which the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> considers negligible. For apples it was 150 times that benchmark, according to the documents. By comparison, the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> estimated risk estimate for Alar on applies earlier this yeas was 45 times the one-in-a-million benchmark. <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Heier </PERSON> emphasized that the risk figures EBDC were preliminary and assumed crop residues at the maximum level of application according to manufacturers' instructions. The companies are conducting marketbasket studies to determine actual exposure to consumers since the chemical is known to decay with time and residues likely will be reduced through handling, processing and washing. Although the manufacturers' announcement named no food products, an environmental group, the <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, said the 13 crops for which <ORGANIZATION> EBDC </ORGANIZATION> will continue to be used include potatoes, sugar beets, sweet corn, tomatoes and wheat and almonds. <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> Hathaway </PERSON>, an attorney for the environmental group, called the voluntary withdrawal of the chemical from many food crops `` an unprecedented and responsible step'' in that it comes even before the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> has proposed curbs on the fungicide's uses. But Ms. <PERSON> Hathaway </PERSON> maintained that the chemical continues to pose significant health risks in some of the foods for which it has not been withdrawn `` particularly foods like bananas, grapes and potatoes which are consumed in large quantities by children.''

<HEAD>Pullout of U.S. Diplomats Marks Milestone in Relations</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The evacuation of the last <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomats from <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> marks a milestone in 30 years of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> involvement in turbulent <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s envoys had clung tenaciously to the war-battered capital despite the assassination of one <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambasador, the suicide car bombings of two embassy buildings, the abductions of Americans and murderous artillery barrages. But on Wednesday, Ambassador <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> and his 29 remaining American staff members slipped out of the country aboard three <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> helicopters amid mounting criticism from militant pro-Western Christians. The Christian standard-bearer, army commander Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, had charged that <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> has `` sold <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'' out of fear for the lives of eight Americans held hostage by pro-Iranian zealots. But <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> Spokeswoman <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> angrily blamed the evacuation on <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, saying he had threatened to expose <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> and his staff to a `` good dose of Christian terrorism.'' She said that before the evacuation, an unidentified telephone caller had threatened to shoot down a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> helicopter that brought supplies to the hilltop embassy compound in east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s Christian suburb of <LOCATION> Aukar </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s supporters besieged the embassy on Tuesday and Ms. <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said an unidentified leader of the protest had warned that embassy employees moved in and out of the premises `` at their own risk.'' The protesters called off the siege hours after the evacuation. It is the first time that an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> ambassador has been pulled from <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> since <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s civil war between Moslems and Christians began in 1975. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials were at pains to point out that <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> diplomats would return to the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> country as soon as conditions permit, but there was no sign that this would be any time soon. Observers in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> said the American pullout would escalate the nearly 6-month-old confrontation between <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s 20,000 mainly Christian troops and 40,000 Syrian soldiers based in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s Moslem areas The fear is that the Syrians could be encouraged by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> withdrawal to step up their military pressure on <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s forces in the besieged Christian enclave north of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s troops have been locked in savage artillery duels with the Syrians and their Druse Moslem allies since March 8. The battles have killed 828 people, wounded 2,455 and forced many of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s 1.5 million residents to flee the city <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> intervened in 1976 under an Arab League mandate to stop the civil war. But <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, who heads a <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> military Cabinet in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s splintered government, contends the Syrians betrayed their mission by supporting the Moslems. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> declared a `` war of liberation'' March 14 to drive the Syrians out. They retaliated by blockading and ruthlessly shelling the Christian enclave. <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>, whose mansion in suburban <LOCATION> Yarze </LOCATION> was frequently hit by <LOCATION> Syrian </LOCATION> shellfire, has been outspokenly critical of <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s actions and repeatedly urged <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> to begin a dialogue with <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>. But the 54-year-old Maronite Catholic general said <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>'s behests were merely `` lip service'' and demanded full <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> recognition of him as the legitimate prime minister of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> came to <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> late in September 1988. But he did not present his credentials pending the election of a new head of state to succeed former President <PERSON> Amin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON>, whose six-year term expired that month. <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>'s move was designed to avoid recognizing either <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s Cabinet, which was formed by <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON> minutes before he bowed out, or that of acting Prime Minister <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON>, a Sunni Moslem The power struggle between the two Cabinets has deepened the de facto partition of the country into sectarian mini-states. The evacuation of <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> and his staff was carried out with surgical precision. Two helicopters landed at the embassy compound at first light and took off with all 30 people within five minutes. A third gunship flew cover, witnesses reported. Nearly 540 Lebanese guards and administrative employees were left in control of the embassy and of the ambassador's residence in <LOCATION> Yarze </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> involvement in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> began July 15, 1958, when President <PERSON> Dwight </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Eisenhower </PERSON> sent <ORGANIZATION> Marines </ORGANIZATION> to <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> at the request of Christian President <PERSON> Camille </PERSON> <PERSON> Chamoun </PERSON> to quell an uprising by <PERSON> Chamoun </PERSON>'s Moslem rivals. Civil war broke out in 1975 and the following year Moslem radicals kidnapped and murdered <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> Melloy </PERSON> along with his economic counselor <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Waring </PERSON>. With the war, <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> became the dominant force in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s Moslem areas. That lasted until <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> invaded in June 1982. In August of that year, 800 <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marines </ORGANIZATION>, part of a 5,400-man peacekeeping force with British, French and Italian units, went ashore to oversee the evacuation of Israeli, Syrian and <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> forces from <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> force was later increased to 1,800 men. In April 1983, a Shiite Moslem suicide bomber rammed an explosives-packed van into the seaside <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy in west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, killing 63 people, including 17 Americans. The worst was yet to come. On Oct. 23, 1983, another Shiite suicide bomber attacked the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Marine base near <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> airport, killing 241 men, and a second bomber attacked a <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> paratroopers' base, killing 58 men. In December, American reconnaisance planes were fired on and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> responded with a <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> fighter-bomber attack that inflicted `` significant damage'' on Syrian missile and artillery batteries in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. A few days later, the battleship USS <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> bombarded Moslem positions with 250 shells from its 16-inch guns. But in February 1984, as the civil war erupted anew, the Marines were pulled back to warships off <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, a move that marked the beginning of their final withdrawal after a 22-month peacekeeping operation in which 264 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> servicemen were killed. In September 1984 a suicide bomber hit the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> embassy annex in <LOCATION> Christian </LOCATION> east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, killing 12 people and wounding 96, including the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador. It was this compound that was evacuated Wednesday.

<HEAD>Kabuki Troupe Opens in Met Opera House</HEAD>

 Americans who only occasionally see Japanese kabuki theater may not find <PERSON> Ennosuke </PERSON>'s Kabuki as controversial as publicity before its appearances here and in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> has led them to expect. Except for some acrobatics, quick costume changes and one exit on wires through the sky, at Wednesday's first of eight performances at the Metropolitan Opera, <PERSON> Ennosuke </PERSON>'s Kabuki seemed largely to follow kabuki's traditions such as stylized fights and poses held a moment to increase tension. The troupe later will perform at Kennedy Center. The most remarkable aspect of <PERSON> Ennosuke </PERSON>'s Kabuki is its leading actor, <PERSON> Ichikawa </PERSON> <PERSON> Ennosuke </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, who has organized this company of 36 actors and 24 musicians. Two pieces are done at each performance, which lasts three and a half hours, longer than many Americans wish an evening of theater to last. The first is three acts from `` Yoshitsune Senbonzakura,'' an eight-hour, six-act play which was first done in 1747 with puppets and adapted to kabuki the following year. In it, <PERSON> Ennosuke </PERSON> plays two parts, <PERSON> Tadanobu </PERSON>, a warrior faithful to a hero and a fox who has transformed himself to look like the warrior. The fox did it, the audience learns, to be near <PERSON> Tadanobu </PERSON>'s lover who has a drum made of the skin of his parents. This illustrates fillial piety. <PERSON> Ennosuke </PERSON>, who is 49, is young enough to jump up a flight of steps two at a time, vault off the back of a porch and crawl under it, emerging at the front in white fox fur. But more remarkable than that is the difference in stance the actor has for <PERSON> Tadanobu </PERSON> and for the fox as <PERSON> Tadanobu </PERSON>, when his hands subtly become paws and his head is held less militarily. Some kabuki companies' strongest actors play young women. However, the actor playing <PERSON> Tadanobu </PERSON>'s lover was simpering and whiney. In the second play, `` Kurozuka,'' <PERSON> Ennosuke </PERSON> played an old woman, actually a demon, whose soul is soothed by a <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> priest who says that even demons can find enlightenment. <PERSON> Ennosuke </PERSON> does a gentle dance in what looks like a corn field, including deep breaths of relief. Then a comic character, played by <PERSON> Ennosuke </PERSON>'s younger brother, blunders and <PERSON> Ennosuke </PERSON> becomes a demon with red tongue and deep, angry voice. In other kabuki troupes visiting here, older actors have made characters like the old woman more poignant. But <PERSON> Ennosuke </PERSON>'s old woman is n't superficial. One would like to see his troupe again and him again, as he deepens farther in conveying human emotion. Viewers could rent an apparatus to place in one ear, for English summary and commentary, while allowing the rise and fall of the Japanese voices to be heard with the other ear.

 Former Laker Girl <PERSON> Paula </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON>'s energetic `` Straight Up'' video won four trophies at the sixth annual MTV Video Music Awards as <PERSON> Madonna </PERSON> claimed the Viewers' Choice and three technical honors Wednesday night `` I owe a lot to being a Laker Girl,'' <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON>, who began her career as a cheerleader for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Basketball </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> team here, said backstage at the Universal Amphitheatre. `` It was a great vehicle to start off.'' <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON>'s video, which drew on cheerleading dance styles, took best female video, dance, choreography and editing. Veteran rocker <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> earned best video for the satirical `` This Note's For You,'' which <ORGANIZATION> MTV </ORGANIZATION> once banned from broadcast, ostensibly because it contained commercial messages. The video satirized rock star endorsements of products, and featured <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Whitney </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> lookalikes. <PERSON> Madonna </PERSON>, who was nominated six times, got the Viewer's Choice award for `` Like a Prayer.'' Her `` Express Yourself'' video earned direction honors for <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Fincher </PERSON>, the art direction trophy for <PERSON> Vance </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzini </PERSON>, and best cinematography for <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Plummer </PERSON>. `` I guess this means you like me, you really like me,'' the singer said after receiving her Viewers Choice award, in a joking echo of actress <PERSON> Sally </PERSON> <PERSON> Field </PERSON>'s `` You like me'' acceptance speech at the 1984 Academy Awards. `` And I'd like to thank <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION> for causing so much controversy,'' <PERSON> Madonna </PERSON> added. The <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in April withdrew its television commercial featuring <PERSON> Madonna </PERSON> and also its sponsorship of her tour. The commercial featured a burning cross and other images that offended Christian groups, particularly Roman Catholics. The Viewers Choice is a popularity award determined by telephone votes and ballots received by mail and fax machine. Funk rockers <ORGANIZATION> Living </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colour </ORGANIZATION> won best group, new artist and stage performance awards for `` Cult of Personality.'' They accepted their trophies backstage at Three Rivers Stadium in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>, where they were performing with the Rolling Stones. Stones' lead singer <PERSON> Mick </PERSON> <PERSON> Jagger </PERSON> presented the best group video trophies during the live satellite remote. <PERSON> Elvis </PERSON> <PERSON> Costello </PERSON> got the male video honor for `` <PERSON> Veronica </PERSON>,'' R.E.M.'s `` Orange Crush'' captured the post-modern category. <PERSON> Madonna </PERSON>, taking a sultry stage pose with a cigarette and a two-woman entourage, introduced the career-achievement Video Vanguard award to pop singer <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON>. The award had been announced in advance. D.J. <ORGANIZATION> Jazzy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jeff </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; The Fresh Prince won the rap award for `` Parents Just Do n't Understand.'' `` This is a dream come true,'' said <PERSON> Fresh </PERSON> <PERSON> Prince </PERSON>, 19, who urged all of the `` kids out there'' to `` Stay away from drugs and all that stuff.'' `` Kiss,'' by Art of Noise and featuring vocals by <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, was hailed as the year's breakthrough video. Guns N' Roses won the heavy metal category for `` Sweet Child O' Mine'' and the combination of Irish rockers U2 and veteran bluesman B.B King earned a best video from film trophy for `` When Love Comes to Town'' from the concert movie `` Rattle and Hum.'' The awards show, hosted by <ORGANIZATION> Arsenio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hall </ORGANIZATION>, lasted 2 -LCB- hours and featured performances by <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON>, <PERSON> Cher </PERSON>, <PERSON> Def </PERSON> <PERSON> Leppard </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> Bon </PERSON> <PERSON> Jovi </PERSON>, <PERSON> Richie </PERSON> <PERSON> Sambora </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Madonna </PERSON>. A performance by <ORGANIZATION> MTV </ORGANIZATION> comic <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Dice </PERSON> <PERSON> Clay </PERSON> was filled with obscene, unprintable poems and comments about overweight women and sex. MTV Vice President <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Kluger </PERSON> quickly went before reporters backstage and apologized for the material. `` <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Dice </PERSON> <PERSON> Clay </PERSON> did not do this in rehearsal and we were very surprised by it. Based on this experience, <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Dice </PERSON> <PERSON> Clay </PERSON> will not be appearing on <ORGANIZATION> MTV </ORGANIZATION> in the future,'' <PERSON> Kluger </PERSON> said. The comic had already left before <PERSON> Kluger </PERSON>'s statement. Pop superstar <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> had the odds in his favor going into the show, but he cashed in only one of his eight nominations, earning a special effects trophy for <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Blashfield </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jody </PERSON> <PERSON> Watley </PERSON> came up emptyhanded despite six nominations for `` Real Love.'' Puerto Rican singer <PERSON> Chayanne </PERSON> won best Latin rock video in the International Viewers Choice award, a popularity contest determined by telephone votes and ballots received by mail and fax machine. Nominations were made in 18 general and professional categories. The additional special categories included Hall of Fame, <ORGANIZATION> Viewers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Choice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Viewers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Choice </ORGANIZATION>, the latter for best European, Australian, Japanese and Latin rock videos. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was a multiple winner at the first MTV Video Music Awards in 1984, taking the special Viewer's Choice, choreography and overall performance honors for `` Thriller.'' But even then he was overshadowed by <PERSON> Herbie </PERSON> <PERSON> Hancock </PERSON>'s six awards for `` Rockit.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> did n't get another <ORGANIZATION> MTV </ORGANIZATION> award until last year, when he was given a special Video Vanguard award. And despite an emphasis on stunning visuals, <PERSON> Madonna </PERSON> did n't win an <ORGANIZATION> MTV </ORGANIZATION> award until 1986. Her second came in 1987. In the short history of the <ORGANIZATION> MTV </ORGANIZATION> awards, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Gabriel </PERSON> was the biggest winner of a single year, collecting nine silver statuettes for `` Sledgehammer'' in 1987. The first and second MTV awards were staged at Radio City Music Hall in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. The 1986 show originated from both the Universal Amphitheatre and the Palladium in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Since then the amphitheater has been its home.

 When <PERSON> Cath </PERSON> <PERSON> Tschirn </PERSON> marries <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> on Saturday, she plans to get out of her wheelchair for the first time in five years and stand up to say her vows. With the help of the 2-year-old southeastern <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> branch of Volunteers for Medical Engineering, Miss Tschirn -LRB- pronounced Churn -RRB- said she hopes to fulfill her dreams of a fairy tale wedding. `` I got the dress I wanted. If I had n't had the accident, I'd be standing up. Plus, I think I'll shock the whole church,'' she said. The 20-year-old Miss Tschirn was a junior in high school, a cheerleader and a drama club member on Oct. 17, 1984, when the car in which she was riding flipped over. `` All that really happened to me is I was paralyzed,'' she said. `` I did n't have a scratch.'' The organization built a stand for Miss Tschirn to hold herself up, and on the bottom is a lazy susan, which will allow her to turn around and greet the congregation when she and her husband are introduced as Mr. and Mrs. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>. Founded in 1982 by <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Staehlin </PERSON>, the organization has grown from the first club in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> to 400 members and 12 chapters, according to <PERSON> Carole </PERSON> <PERSON> Forsythe </PERSON>, its executive director. Ms. <PERSON> Forsythe </PERSON> said <PERSON> Staehlin </PERSON>, an engineer at a defense plant in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>, had wanted for years to do something other than defense work. `` He was sitting in church and heard a sermon on using your talents'' and decided to do it, she said. Besides the stand for Miss Tschirn, projects have included software and switches that enable an immobilized person to use a computer by blinking one's eyes; research on an artificial muscle; and voice-controlled videocassette recorders. Using donated funds, the <ORGANIZATION> Newport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> chapter bought the materials to make the device for Miss Tschirn, said <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitlock </PERSON>, president of the club and director of maintenance engineering and environmental services at <ORGANIZATION> Riverside </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rehabilitation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Newport </LOCATION> <LOCATION> News </LOCATION>. One club member helped in Miss <PERSON> Tschirn </PERSON>'s rehabilitation and let the group know of the young woman's dream. `` I understand soon after she was injured, she stated it blankly: ` I want to stand up at my wedding,''' <PERSON> Whitlock </PERSON> said. After a yearlong rehabilitation, Miss <PERSON> Tschirn </PERSON> graduated with her high school class. She has regained some movement in her feet. She works, lives in an apartment behind her parents' garage and considers herself more independent than many people who have suffered similar accidents. She also talks to children and anyone who will listen about wearing seat belts, since she was not wearing one when the accident occurred. She met her fiance a year after her accident. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> also was in a car accident and used a wheelchair for three months. `` My fiance said, ` I do n't see why you're so hung up on standing up,''' she recalled. `` ` I did n't meet you standing up.''' Miss Tschirn hopes to leave the wheelchair behind at the altar and sit in another chair for the first part of the ceremony, then stand up for the vows. She and <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> will operate the stand, which will be decorated with ribbons and lace. `` I'm going to get him to carry me down the aisle,'' she said.

 An <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> laboratory is under investigation for possible ethics violations in transferring sensitive computer technology to a new company led by former lab scientists who helped develop the process. Officials at <ORGANIZATION> Lawrence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Livermore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday defended the licensing, which is being investigated separately by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> investigations subcommittee and the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s Office of Inspector General. `` We are satisfied that from all we know, all was legal and above board,'' said <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Garberson </PERSON>, a spokesman at the <LOCATION> Livermore </LOCATION>, Calif.-based laboratory managed by the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> under an <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> contract. Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON>, D-Mich., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel, raised ethics and other questions about the licensing agreement in a letter to <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> A copy of the July 7 letter was made available to <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday. <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON> called the awarding of a license to the company n-Chip for commercial development of the technology `` highly curious.'' He cited `` the appearance of a conflict of interest'' in the granting of an exclusive license to a company whose top officials include at least three people who helped the lab develop the process. Laser pantography is used for interconnecting computer chips in a way that permits supercomputers to be compressed to the size of a pack of cigarettes. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Longerbeam </PERSON>, head of the lab's technology transfers program, said in a telephone interview that stringent measures were taken to ensure that the n-Chip licensing process was fair and legal. No other companies expressed interest in getting the license until after the lab had signed a legally binding agreement with n-Chip to negotiate terms of the deal, he said. <PERSON> Longerbeam </PERSON> said laser pantography was developed as part of a <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> electronics program but that it had no direct connection to work on the Strategic Defense Initiative, commonly known as Star Wars. He said the technology was not classified but that some of its applications could be. The exclusive licensing agreement with n-Chip was made in January and took effect in June. Three of n-Chip's main officers are former <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Livermore </PERSON> employees, including <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Haussmann </PERSON>, who was associate director-at-large at the lab and had management responsibility for the laser pantography project until he left in April 1988. <PERSON> Haussmann </PERSON> is vice president for special projects at n-Chip. The others previously involved in development of the technology are <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> McWilliams </PERSON>, n-Chip president, and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Tuckerman </PERSON>, vice president of technology. <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>, a spokeswoman at the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> field operations office, which oversees work done at <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Livermore </PERSON>, said she could not comment because the case was under investigation by the inspector general. Ms. <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> confirmed that the investigation was requested by the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> office, but she declined to say what prompted it. <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> DeMaire </PERSON>, executive director of the inspector general's office, said that as a matter of policy she could neither confirm nor deny the existence of any investigation An investigator on <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON>'s subcommittee, speaking on condition he not be identified, said the panel had seen no sign of criminal activity in the licensing of the technology. But he stressed that recent meetings with <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and lab officials had not answered all questions about possible ethics violations. Among the issues raised by <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON> was whether <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Livermore </PERSON> had alerted other private companies that the technology was going to be made commercially available before choosing n-Chip for the license to develop it. `` What we're looking at is does this mean a person gets an unfair advantage in acquiring this technology just because he has a connection with a lab?'' the subcommittee investigator said. <PERSON> Longerbeam </PERSON> said the technology was `` broadly communicated to segments and sectors of the electronics industry'' for several years before the agreement with n-Chip.

 <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> says President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, not the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, is responsible for the 200 vacancies still remaining in top policy-making positions in the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s attempt to blame the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> for foot-dragging is `` unwarranted and unfair,'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said. In each of the 200 positions, the president has not indicated that holdovers from the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration will be asked to stay on, the <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> Democrat told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday. There are a total of 432 such jobs. `` Thus, nearly eight months after he took office, the president has failed to make nominations for nearly half of the full-time positions in executive departments and independent agencies which require <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> confirmation. `` Whose responsibility is that?'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> asked. `` It is certainly not the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s.'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> noted that after he met with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Aug. 4 to discuss nominations, White House Press Secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, `` The president wanted to express his deep concern that these -LRB- nominations -RRB- were being held up for artificial reasons not related to the candidates themselves.'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said that, based on a careful review of the status of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> nominations to date, he is `` urging that the president discontinue such criticism.'' `` It is unfounded and unfair,'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said. `` The principal problem is in the slow pace at which nominations are being made, not in the pace at which nominations, once made, are being processed.'' He said there are 48 policy-making positions in government departments that are `` totally vacant,'' with no nominations submitted and no holdovers from the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. `` Out of 14 Cabinet departments, only the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> has no totally vacant positions,'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said. `` There are five totally vacant positions in the Executive Office of the President and another 20 in major independent agencies.'' In education, he said, there are no nominees to fill assistant secretary positions in elementary and secondary education or in vocational and adult education and civil rights. In public health, <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said, there is no nominee for Surgeon General, commissioner of aging or for administrator of the <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Care </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. `` The vital 1990 Census is rapidly approaching and there is no nominee to be director of the <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said. `` Whose responsibility is that?'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> has confirmed 212 <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> nominees, 90 percent of them within two months of the time the nominations was received. He did not include nominations for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassadors, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> marshals or <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorneys. He said a slow-motion nominating process is hurting the way the government functions because senior <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> professionals `` do not set policy for an administration.'' `` When there are no people at the top, the professional civil servant does the best he or she can; but policy initiatives await the arrival of presidentially nominated personnel,'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Court Lifts Injunction on Logging in Spotted Owl Habitat</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The government will seek the resumption of logging in western <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>'s old-growth forests, an official said after a federal court lifted its ban on timber-cutting in the northern spotted owl's habitat. Conservationists who sued to prevent lumbering said that while the 9th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeal </ORGANIZATION>'s unanimous ruling Wednesday removed the overall ban imposed June 7, it still permitted challenges to individual projects. <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ciliberti </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Land </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> spokesman, said 66 million board-feet of timber are ready for sale. The injunction had forbidden timber sales within 2.1 miles of any spotted owl site identified by the bureau. `` We are giving direction for our districts to begin moving those sales that have been enjoined,'' <PERSON> Ciliberti </PERSON> said. If timber sales proceed, conservationists will seek `` endangered species'' status for the owl, said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Monteith </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Oregon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. The <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> has proposed `` threatened'' status for the bird, a designation which would be weaker than that desired by conservationists. The owl inhabits old-growth forests in western <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, western <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> and northern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, mostly on federal land. Scientists view it as a species whose condition indicates a forest's overall health The three-member appeals court rejected conservation groups' chief argument that new information on dangers to the owl's survival was ignored by the <ORGANIZATION> BLM </ORGANIZATION> in its environmental review The panel said the issue could not be raised in a lawsuit because of a federal law backed by the timber industry. However, the court revived sections of the lawsuit contending that destruction of owl habitat by logging violated federal bird protection law and federal and state land-management laws. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Rutzick </PERSON>, the lawyer for the timber industry's <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resource </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, said the ruling offered the promise of final victory in the case for loggers and <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> communities that depend on logging. <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Sher </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Sierra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION>, the lead environmentalst attorney, said: `` It's a disappointment, but the fault is <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' and not the court's. ... We proved that the <ORGANIZATION> BLM </ORGANIZATION> had violated the law, but <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has said the courts ca n't hear the case.'' The lawsuit challenged the <ORGANIZATION> BLM </ORGANIZATION>'s refusal in 1987 to conduct a new environmental analysis of hundreds of planned timber sales in western <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> based on a new study increasing previous predictions of danger to the owl. The bureau contended it already had taken adequate measures to protect the bird. In May, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> Frye </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION> dismissed the lawsuit, allowing the <ORGANIZATION> BLM </ORGANIZATION> to proceed with logging of 337 million board-feet of timber. She said the agency had failed to plan adequately for protection of the spotted owl, but added that her hands were tied by federal law. The appeals court agreed with <PERSON> Frye </PERSON>'s interpretation that the <ORGANIZATION> BLM </ORGANIZATION>'s timber management plan could not be challenged in court on the basis of new information. The law allowed challenges to particular activities in the plan. In his opinion, Chief Judge <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodwin </PERSON> said environmentalists' challenge to numerous individual logging sales amounted to a challenge to the overall <ORGANIZATION> BLM </ORGANIZATION> plan, even if disputed sales added up to only 30 percent of the total. The attacks on individual sales were based on a disagreement with the <ORGANIZATION> BLM </ORGANIZATION>'s decision to designate certain areas for `` intensive timber management,'' <PERSON> Goodwin </PERSON> said. That decision `` was made with the knowledge that owl habitat would be sacrificed in the clear cuts and conversion to second-growth forest,'' he said. `` That intentional trade-off of owls for economic gain was precisely the land-use decision which is being challenged.'' The court reinstated conservationists' claims that the destruction of spotted owl habitat violated the Migratory Bird Treaty Act and federal, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> land management laws. <PERSON> Frye </PERSON> had dismissed those claims, saying they should have been made while the <ORGANIZATION> BLM </ORGANIZATION>'s timber plans were being developed. But <PERSON> Goodwin </PERSON> said environmental groups had acted as soon as they could after getting the new information about possible dangers to the owl. The court ordered <PERSON> Frye </PERSON> to consider the claims on their merits but did not impose a new injuction during that review.

 Hundreds of striking <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> employees, ending a 3,000-mile march that began last month in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, want the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> to bring to a vote a measure to force resolution of the 6-month-old walkout. The 26-day relay march, which included rallies in a number of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> cities, ended Wednesday on the west steps of the Capitol amid chants of `` One more day.'' The marchers were joined by union leaders and several members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` We're in a tough battle against one of the worst employers in the country,'' <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON> told the crowd. `` We know which side the president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is on. He's made that abundantly clear,'' said <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON>, prompting marchers to chant `` Where was <PERSON> George </PERSON>?''

Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarbanes </PERSON>, D-Md., describing <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> as a `` modern-day robber baron,'' said the strikers were `` fighting for justice for all American workers. Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, D-Ga., donned a red shirt that urged a boycott of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and Lorenzo-owned <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> `` I believe <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> is vicious and greedy,'' <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> said.

The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> approved such a bill after President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> refused to follow a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mediation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> recommendation that he appoint an emergency board. `` Working men have to stick together,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, D-Ill., vowing to push for <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approval of the emergency legislation The rally came at the end of a march and caravan that began Aug. 12 in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>.

The striking unions accuse <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> of planning to strip away <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s assets until the airline is dead. However, Eastern officials have said they are gradually building the airline back up to a major carrier and have been adding flights and personnel since filing for reorganization under bankruptcy laws.

<HEAD>Interpretation of Regulations Will Affect S&amp;Ls</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Savings institutions representing 80 percent of the industry could fail new capital standards if regulators choose the strictest interpretation of legislation enacted last month. Under one interpretation of the bill signed into law Aug. 9 by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, about 1,400 of the nation's 2,700 solvent thrifts, representing $ 1 trillion in assets, or 80 percent of the industry, would fall short, regulators in the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thrift </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supervision </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday. However, under a more lenient reading of the law, only 600 institutions with about $ 500 billion in assets would miss the standard and be subject to regulatory sanctions, including restrictions on growth and government review of their business plans. The key reform in the bill requires <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L owners to risk more of their own capital as a buffer between losses and government deposit insurance funds. However, <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L regulators said they were not sure exactly how tough the standard should be. The problem, according to <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Wall </PERSON>, director of the thrift office, is that the final bill was cobbled together from very different versions passed separately by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. `` When you compromise widely divergent views, you do n't necessarily come up with something that's clear and that's what we have here,'' he said One section of the bill _ the section that got the most attention during congressional debate _ establishes a new standard for `` core'' capital of 3 percent of loans and other assets. However, the S & amp; L bill also requires thrifts to meet capital standards `` no less stringent'' than those adopted for national banks. Currently, that is 5.5 percent. Further complicating the matter is the fact that national bank capital standards will be overhauled by 1991 in a way that varies required capital depending on the riskiness of an institution's loans and other investments Regulators could impose very stringent standards on <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls, only to wind up having to write more lenient rules a year later when the new risk-adjusted bank standards for banks take effect. S & amp; Ls generally fare better than banks under risk-adjusted rules because they concentrate heavily on mortgage lending, which is considered safer than commercial lending. Regulators must resolve the dilemma by Nov. 7, when they're due to publish capital rules taking effect a month later. Before that, the Office of Thrift Supervision, which was once an independent agency called the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, must clear the new rules with the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. In deciding the issue, <PERSON> Wall </PERSON> said regulators are trying to figure out the intent of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> when it passed the bill, but because different factions assigned different meanings to the same passages, that's not easy. Rep. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said in a letter to <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> intended the 3 percent standard to apply, not the 5.5 percent. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Glauber </PERSON>, under secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>'s letter was an important contribution to unsnarling the problem But, he said, `` a literal reading of the language of the bill leaves it open to a variety of interpretations. ... I do n't think there's a particularly persuasive case for one interpretation or another.''

 Plane crash survivors who were stranded in the <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> jungle for nearly two days said the pilot asked for their forgiveness and wished them luck as their jet crashed into dense vegetation. `` We were ready to die but the hand of God guided our descent,'' passenger <PERSON> Epaminondas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Sousa </PERSON> <PERSON> Chaves </PERSON>, 36, said Wednesday after Air force helicopters airlifted 41 survivors out of the jungle. Their Varig airlines <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737-200 crashed Sunday night, killing at least 10 of the 54 people aboard. `` It is incredible that we came out alive,'' said <PERSON> Regia </PERSON> <PERSON> Acevedo </PERSON>, 29, who was thrown from the plane with her husband, <PERSON> Raimundo </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> spokesman Col. <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> dos </PERSON> <PERSON> Santos </PERSON> told a news conference that two passengers died Wednesday and identified them as a man trapped in the wreckage and a woman who died on a rescue plane en route to <LOCATION> Brasilia </LOCATION>. The aircraft disappeared Sunday night when the pilot reported problems with his navigational system and the plane strayed far off route. <ORGANIZATION> Chaves </ORGANIZATION> said the aircraft ran out of fuel and went down in thick forest cover. `` With a calm voice the pilot asked us to forgive him, and told us to pray to God and wished us luck. All of a sudden the motors stopped and I do n't know if 10 minutes went by, 15 or even a minute,'' <ORGANIZATION> Chaves </ORGANIZATION> said. He said the plane `` seemed to bounce'' when it hit the top of the 100-foot trees, then smashed through the jungle cover in the northern part of the central-western <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> state of <LOCATION> Mato </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grosso </LOCATION>. Both wings were ripped from the plane but the fuselage was nearly intact. The plane bore a 300-by-120-foot hole in the jungle but did not explode, <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON> said. `` It was as if a giant claw had scratched the body of the plane. First there was a deafening screech and then a silence, and then absolute darkness,'' Ms. <PERSON> Acevedo </PERSON> said. Another passenger, <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Gadelha </PERSON>, said: `` All of a sudden there was a flash of lightning. I lost consciousness, and when I woke up I was outside the plane and alive.'' The air force found the plane Tuesday night after four survivors walked through the jungle and contaced authorities by ham radio. On Wednesday morning rescue helicopters airlifted 41 people nearly 30 miles to a ranch near <LOCATION> Sao </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION> do <LOCATION> Xingu </LOCATION>, about 1,050 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Janeiro </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Santos </PERSON> said. From the ranch, three twin-engine Bandeirante planes took the survivors to the mountain <PERSON> Serra </PERSON> do Cachimbo air base 185 miles northwest. There, the survivors let their emotions go and wept was they were greeted by rescue workers. They later were flown to <LOCATION> Brasilia </LOCATION>, the capital, for care at the <LOCATION> Brasilia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Base </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Santos </PERSON> said. The pilot of plane did not speak with reporters upon arriving in <LOCATION> Brasilia </LOCATION> and airline officials declined further comment on what caused the crash. The plane, purchased by <ORGANIZATION> Varig </ORGANIZATION> airlines in 1982, had strayed off course while on the last leg of a regularly scheduled flight between the southeastern city of <LOCATION> Sao </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paulo </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Belem </LOCATION>, 2,140 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> at the mouth of the <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> river.

<HEAD>Atlantis Astronauts Believe Nuclear-Powered Planetary Probe Safe</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SPACE CENTER, Houston (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The astronaut who will command Atlantis next month on a mission to deploy a probe to <ORGANIZATION> Jupiter </ORGANIZATION> says he has no qualms about flying with two nuclear generators aboard the shuttle. The two radio-isotope thermo-electric generators, or RTGs, will power the <ORGANIZATION> Galileo </ORGANIZATION> probe on its trip across the solar system. Some anti-nuclear groups claim the nuclear material could pose a health hazard if released during a shuttle accident. `` The chances are so remote it's not worth worrying about,'' Atlantis commander <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said Wednesday. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> and Atlantis' four other astronauts discussed the mission during individual interviews and at a final preflight press conference. The crew will spend the next month training for the mission, scheduled to begin Oct. 12. `` There's a certain amount of risk involved in anything you do these days,'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said. `` -LRB- But -RRB- I'm satisfied in my mind ... that we've done the best possible job we can to make these things as safe as we possibly can.'' Atlantis' other astronauts agreed. `` I do n't see how it can hurt anyone unless it hits him on the head, and that's pretty remote,'' said pilot <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> McCulley </PERSON>. The other crew members are <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> Chang-Diaz </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> and <PERSON> Shannon </PERSON> <PERSON> Lucid </PERSON> _ all mission specialists. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> and <PERSON> McCulley </PERSON> are space rookies. Each of the 122-pound RTGs contain about 24 pounds of highly toxic plutonium-238 dioxide. The heat released by the plutonium's decay is converted into electricity by instruments called thermocouples The astronauts noted that the nuclear generators are the only known devices that can power a spacecraft going deep into the solar system far from the sun. Voyager 2, which last month relayed stunning photos from <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION>, is powered by similar RTGs. `` If we want to explore the outer parts of the solar system, we do n't have a choice right now,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. `` Voyager would n't be where it is today and we would n't have gotten those beautiful pictures of <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION> back had it not been for the three RTGs that have powered Voyager so well for the last 12 years. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has launched 22 nuclear-powered spacecraft since 1961, with all the plutonium packages encased in super hardened material designed to survive the worst possible fire or explosive conditions. None resulted in the release of radioactive release, even though one package was aboard a rocket that exploded and two survived flaming re-entries through Earth's atmosphere after accidents. But some anti-nuclear and environmental groups have protested the use of plutonium aboard Atlantis, citing the 1986 Challenger explosion as an example of how things can go wrong. They contend a similar explosion could result in radioactive contamination of the <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canaveral </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, area. The White House has to approve the mission because of the nuclear material aboard, and an announcement is expected soon. If the mission is approved, opposition groups said they would seek a court order to block the liftoff. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> said an exhaustive post-Challenger safety review indicates that the chances of a launch accident in which substantial quantities of plutonium, pulverized to breathable form, could be released is about 1-in-2 ,700 And even then, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> said, any contamination would be minor. Once deployed, <ORGANIZATION> Galileo </ORGANIZATION> will embark on a six-year journey to <LOCATION> Jupiter </LOCATION> where it will fire a scientific probe into the Jovian atmosphere and orbit the planet for 22 months of extensive exploration. `` It's just very exciting,'' <PERSON> Lucid </PERSON> said. `` It's important for us to learn. It's important for us to know about our solar system. It's important to learn about the universe we're in.

 Drug czar <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>'s suggestion that entertainers who reveal past addictions might lead others to abuse drugs was ridiculed by some celebrities. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> is `` an embarrassment to the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people,'' said <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON>, producer of the groundbreaking television campaign Rock Against Drugs, which featured popular musicians such as <PERSON> Belinda </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlisle </PERSON> and <PERSON> Vince </PERSON> <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> talking about their own drug addiction recoveries. In the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Strategy </ORGANIZATION> report issued this week, <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> praised campaigns that encourage negative attitudes toward drugs and that label drug users as losers. `` Less useful _ and probably even counterproductive _ are commercials in which sports and pop music stars who are reformed drug users tell young people not to do as they have done,'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> also said. `` Such commercials may lack credibility, and they also carry an unintended message: that you can do drugs and still be rich and successful.'' Actor <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON>, who has made public service announcements on television and radio discussing his eight-year addiction to cocaine and alcohol, said that <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>'s criticism was misguided. `` I'm just out here to try to educate, and I think most of the celebrities who do these things are there to help educate,'' said the former star of `` Trapper <PERSON> John </PERSON>. M.D.,'' now sober for two years. `` If <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> thinks that it's a mistake, he can think that. But I'd like to see him do something constructive instead of just critiquing other people's attempts,'' <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Atlanta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Braves </ORGANIZATION> outfielder <PERSON> Lonnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, a recovering cocaine addict who has discussed openly his habit's costly toll, simply laughed and shook his head when asked to respond to <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>'s comments `` <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> is entitled to his opinion,'' is all <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> would say. <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON>, who brought the Rock Against Drugs campaign to national television in 1987, said RAD's TV spots were useful because they employed former addicts steering users toward sobriety, a tactic shared by Alcoholics Anonymous and Cocaine Anonymous. `` There was no question that the people with the greatest credibility with young people were people who had grappled with the same demons that were assaulting the teen-age fans,'' <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON> said. `` I think that rock stars are people that young people could understand,'' he said. In one of the RAD spots, former <ORGANIZATION> Sex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pistols </ORGANIZATION> guitarist <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said, `` A good friend of mine, <PERSON> Sid </PERSON> <PERSON> Vicious </PERSON>, died of drugs. I nearly died from drugs. Drugs suck.'' Another spot featured <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Crosby </PERSON>, formerly of <LOCATION> Crosby </LOCATION>, Stills, <PERSON> Nash </PERSON> and <PERSON> Young </PERSON>. <PERSON> Crosby </PERSON> said, `` Four things can happen to you if you do drugs: You can go crazy; you can go to prison; you can die; or you can quit.'' <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON> reported that one fan wrote to RAD participant and heavy-metal rocker <PERSON> Ronnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Dio </PERSON> to say, `` Teachers can preach for hours about how bad drugs are and I still went out and got high. But man, once I heard you say how stupid drugs are, I never touched them again.'' <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> said that the `` Just Say No'' anti-drug rhetoric favored by former first lady <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is essentially useless. `` If some guy who's never done drugs in his life, never had a drug problem, comes on and does a ` Just Say No' commercial ... I watch that and I think, ` You ignorant fools. Do n't you understand how much worse it is than that?' `` If I could just say no and walk away, I'd have done it five years ago,'' he said. `` People who just say no do n't have the problem. They have no credibility at all. And it's infuriating.''

<HEAD>Kemp to Revive Suspended Program That Has Cost HUD Millions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> will revive, with significant reforms, a housing insurance program that has cost the government millions because of defaults blamed on mismanagement, agency officials say. The revised multi-family housing co-insurance program will include tighter eligibility requirements for lenders and an expanded monitoring effort by <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>, the officials, who spoke on condition they not be identified, said Wednesday. <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> suspended the program four months ago, ordering a review of its management. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> was to announce plans to renew the program Wednesday but delayed it because of unresolved issues dealing with new regulations, one of the officials said. The officials said staff members would be added to monitor the lenders and the program would be upgraded from a branch of the department's housing division to a separate office under the assistant secretary for housing. The program was a major part of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's effort to turn government tasks over to the private sector Under the program, <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> insures up to about 80 percent of mortgages for multi-family housing projects against default. Defaults in the program total more than $ 700 million, with Washington-based DRG Funding accounting for $ 583 million of the total. <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>'s inspector general, in a critical review of the program, said lenders appeared to be overvaluing property to issue inflated mortgages. That would bring them higher fees because they receive a percentage of the loan amount. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> suspended the program three months ago, one of a number of <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> programs halted or put on hold amid reports of widespread mismanagement, fraud and influence-peddling at the agency under the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. Since <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> took over the agency in February nine companies have been suspended from the program or placed on probation.

<NOTE>Government Could Not Handle Major Spill, Experts Say</NOTE>

 Budget cuts are hampering the government's ability to prevent major <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lakes </LOCATION> oil spills and to minimize the damage if they occur, experts say The oil industry, meanwhile, underestimates the threat to the lakes as it prepares to open emergency response centers along the nation's sea coasts but none on lake shores, witnesses told the Governmental Affairs subcommittee on oversight of government management. The panel, chaired by Sen. <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Levin </PERSON>, D-Mich., is investigating the dangers posed by spills into the lakes in the wake of the March 24 <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valdez </ORGANIZATION> disaster off the Alaskan coast At a hearing Wednesday, speakers said the ramifications of a comparable spill on the lakes would be economically devastating. `` The Great Lakes are far more vulnerable to spills than most people realize, and there are far more inadequacies in our spill response and prevention capabilities than we can or should tolerate,'' <PERSON> Levin </PERSON> said. None of the five emergency response centers envisioned by the oil industry is close enough to contain a major spill on the lakes, said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hales </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION>. In a written statement, the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> said its <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> response office would handle Great Lakes spills. `` Equipment from the ... center could be rapidly airlifted to any <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lakes </LOCATION> port,'' the statement said. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Canadian coast guards reported 492 oil and chemical spills into the lakes in 1988. There were 384 reported spills in 1987 and 401 in 1986.

<HEAD>American Expedition in South Pacific Aimed at Solving Earhart Mystery</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SUVA, Fiji (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The leader of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> team hoping to solve the 52-year-old mystery of where <PERSON> Amelia </PERSON> <PERSON> Earhart </PERSON> crashed said today he believes her plane went down on an uninhabited island and she died of thirst three days later. `` We would n't be going through this exercise if we did n't think there was something there,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gillespie </PERSON>, head of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Historic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aircraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Recovery </ORGANIZATION>. The group, based in <LOCATION> Wilmington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Del. </LOCATION>, believes <PERSON> Earhart </PERSON>'s plane crashed on the <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> of <LOCATION> Nikumaroro </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Kiribati </LOCATION> archipelago, about 1,000 miles east of <LOCATION> Fiji </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gillespie </PERSON> said a 16-member expedition will leave <LOCATION> Suva </LOCATION> on Monday in a converted Japanese trawler and spend three weeks on <LOCATION> Nikumaroro </LOCATION> and nearby <LOCATION> McKean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> looking for evidence. <PERSON> Earhart </PERSON>'s plane disappeared in 1937 after she set off for <LOCATION> Howland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Wau </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Papau </LOCATION> <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Guinea </LOCATION>, to attempt the first trans-Pacific flight. The famed aviator's exploits achieved legendary status in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` We do not claim to have new and revolutionary information or new and revolutionary technology,'' <PERSON> Gillespie </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. `` We have applied rigid academic techniques to solving the Earhart enigma.'' <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> official <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Benzinger </PERSON> said Wednesday that <PERSON> Gillespie </PERSON>'s group had `` fairly persuasive'' evidence that <PERSON> Earhart </PERSON> went down much further eastward than previously thought. `` They have two basic theories about where <PERSON> Earhart </PERSON> crashed, and if they find the evidence it will be sensational,'' he said. <PERSON> Gillespie </PERSON>'s group searched old <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> records to produce the theory that <PERSON> Earhart </PERSON>, running short of fuel, dumped her plane on <LOCATION> Nikumaroro </LOCATION>, which was on her flight path to <LOCATION> Howland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Howland </PERSON> lies north of the <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> and has an airstrip that <PERSON> Earhart </PERSON> had planned to use for refueling before going on to <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>. `` We know for a fact she did not arrive at <LOCATION> Howland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> because people were there waiting for her,'' <PERSON> Gillespie </PERSON> said. `` We know for a fact how fast her plane was going and how much fuel she had on board. When she sent a distress signal she was about 100 miles from <PERSON> Howland </PERSON>. `` It would be logical for her navigator to put down on the nearest bit of land, and that would have to be <LOCATION> Nikumaroro </LOCATION> or <PERSON> McKean </PERSON> since she was lost.'' <PERSON> Gillespie </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> picked up 24 distress signals for three days after the crash. `` They heard a faint woman's voice, which people recognized as <PERSON> Earhart </PERSON>'s, it was on her frequency and her call sign,'' he said. `` The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> launched a search and sent a battleship but because the waters were not well charted it did not put a landing boat ashore'' on <LOCATION> Nikumaroro </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gillespie </PERSON> said a pilot flew over <LOCATION> Nikumaroro </LOCATION> in an ensuing aerial search and reported recent signs of human habitation. He said he believed <PERSON> Earhart </PERSON> died of thirst three days after the crash because <LOCATION> Nikumaroro </LOCATION> has no fresh water and is uninhabited. The island, also known as Gardener, is a rim of land a quarter-mile wide situated around a V-shaped lagoon. <PERSON> McKean </PERSON>, also uninhabited, is a half-mile long and about 800 yards wide. The expedition expects to arrive on <LOCATION> Nikumaroro </LOCATION> around Sept. 16 and <PERSON> Gillespie </PERSON> said he expects to know whether the mission is a success before Oct. 12. `` We hope to find the plane or bits of it. It may have been swept away in a hurricane, and that's why some members of the team are experts in sonar and metal detection,'' he said. He said the expedition will cost $ 250,000. <PERSON> Benzinger </PERSON> said the government of <LOCATION> Kiribati </LOCATION>, a group of 33 islands straddling the equator, gave permission for the expedition. <LOCATION> Kiribati </LOCATION>, formerly the <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ellice </PERSON> islands, was a major battleground during World War II and has a population of about 61,000. An Australian woman pilot, <PERSON> Gaby </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennard </PERSON>, is attempting to fly solo around the world in a single-engine plane as a tribute to <PERSON> Earhart </PERSON>. <PERSON> Kennard </PERSON>, 44, flew this week to <LOCATION> Atchison </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Earhart </PERSON>'s hometown She is a member of the 99 <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION>, which <PERSON> Earhart </PERSON> founded. She expects to complete the journey to <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> via <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> later this month.

<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A 33-year-old quadriplegic quietly accepted the news that a judge had granted his wish to be allowed to shut off the machine that has kept him alive the past four years. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> McAfee </PERSON>, paralyzed from the neck down in a 1985 motorcycle accident, won permission Wednesday to fit the ventilator that allows him to breathe with a device he designed in his head as he lay paralyzed. `` He said, ` Well,' and was quiet, just said, ` Well, good,''' said nurse <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Philpot </PERSON> at the <ORGANIZATION> Briarcliff </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nursing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Alabaster </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, where <ORGANIZATION> McAfee </ORGANIZATION> is staying. `` He's kind of digesting the news, I think.'' Under his plans, <ORGANIZATION> McAfee </ORGANIZATION> would be administered a sedative and use a mouth-held stick to activate the device, which would be connected to a timer to shut off the ventilator. <ORGANIZATION> Fulton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> ruled that <ORGANIZATION> McAfee </ORGANIZATION>'s right to refuse life-sustaining treatment outweighed the state's interest in preserving life. As a competent adult, <ORGANIZATION> McAfee </ORGANIZATION> has the right to refuse medical treatment, the judge said. `` The ventilator to which he is attached is not prolonging his life; it is prolonging his death,'' said <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, who had jurisdiction because <ORGANIZATION> McAfee </ORGANIZATION> is from <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> and had petitioned the <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> court before he was taken to the <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> nursing home. <ORGANIZATION> McAfee </ORGANIZATION> asked the court's permission to shield anyone who helped him from potential legal problems. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> McAfee </ORGANIZATION>'s parents and three adult sisters that the ruling would set a precedent so families in similar situations could make their decisions more privately. In that way, the judge said: `` <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> will have made his last and greatest contribution to his community. I have never met anyone who had a stronger impact on my own life than he had on me when we had the hearing at the hospital Although most `` right-to-die'' cases involve comatose patients or those who can not make their wishes known, a case similar to <ORGANIZATION> McAfee </ORGANIZATION>'s came up in July A 38-year-old <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> man paralyzed in a surfing accident died after a court decided he had the right to have his life-support system shut off. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> ordered the state, which supported <ORGANIZATION> McAfee </ORGANIZATION>'s petition, to appeal to the <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> but said <ORGANIZATION> McAfee </ORGANIZATION> need not await the outcome. <ORGANIZATION> McAfee </ORGANIZATION>'s lawyer, <PERSON> Randall </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, said he did n't expect any opposition. `` The judge hopes they will issue a definitive opinion to make it so that similarly situated people wo n't have to go to court and go through all this,'' <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> was unsure when <ORGANIZATION> McAfee </ORGANIZATION> would ask to be sent back to <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> so he could disconnect the ventilator; he said his client wanted to be sent to a friend's apartment instead of a hospital. `` He has expressed a desire all along to move this along as quickly as possible,'' <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said. `` I assume that continues to be his desire.'' <ORGANIZATION> McAfee </ORGANIZATION> had not arranged to be moved to <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> yet, but the <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> nursing home officials would expedite a move to wherever <ORGANIZATION> McAfee </ORGANIZATION> wished, said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lazarnick </PERSON>, a spokesman for the home. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> conducted a hearing at <ORGANIZATION> McAfee </ORGANIZATION>'s bedside last month, hearing him testify that he wakes up `` just fearful of each new day. There is nothing I have found or can think of that I really enjoy or that has helped me or my situation.'' A petition filed last month included an affidavit that stated, `` I understand turning off the ventilator will result in my death,'' and was signed by a shaky `` X'' made with a pencil held in <ORGANIZATION> McAfee </ORGANIZATION>'s mouth Five family members and a family friend testified that <ORGANIZATION> McAfee </ORGANIZATION> told them numerous times he wanted to die rather than continue living as he is. <PERSON> Julie </PERSON> <PERSON> Orr </PERSON>, a sister, said after the ruling that the family was simply glad it was over. `` It's what <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> wants,'' she said. `` You never know -LRB- how hard it is -RRB- until you're put there.''

 Tougher prison sentences, more treatment, more prison cells, more judges, more police and more money. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s 1989 national war on drugs? No, <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Rockefeller </PERSON>'s 1973 <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> war on drugs. Calling for an end to a `` reign of terror,'' the then-governor told the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> in early 1973: `` What is needed now is a truly effective deterrent to the pushing of drugs so that innocent people will not fall victim to the pusher's tactics or be robbed, mugged or murdered by him.'' With that, <PERSON> Rockefeller </PERSON> proposed mandatory life sentences for drug dealers. The late <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Republican, who went on to become vice president, also asked for 100 new judges and more than 6,000 new prison cells. He got the money for those and for 30,000 new drug-treatment spaces. And, with some modification to make the proposal less Draconian, <ORGANIZATION> Rockefeller </ORGANIZATION> got stiff mandatory prison sentences for pushers. He even got approval for a $ 1,000 bounty to those who turned in drug dealers. New Yorkers got a bill that year for an extra $ 67 million. <PERSON> Rockefeller </PERSON>, having largely failed with earlier programs for voluntary and then mandatory drug treatment, was trying what he called `` the toughest drug law in the nation.'' `` When are we going to open the concentration camps?'' Democratic state Sen. <PERSON> Manfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Ohrenstein </PERSON> asked at the time. He, and others, predicted failure. In fact, after a brief decline, felony drug arrests were on the rise again by late 1974 in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. State officials reported last month that <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s violent crime rate, linked largely to drug-related cases, rose by 9.8 percent in 1988. `` It did n't make a goddamn dent on anything,'' <PERSON> Ohrenstein </PERSON> said this week of <ORGANIZATION> Rockefeller </ORGANIZATION>'s war on drugs. <PERSON> Ohrenstein </PERSON>, who now serves as <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> minority leader, said he views the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> drug offensive in much the same light. `` Each time, we were deceiving the American public,'' said <PERSON> Ohrenstein </PERSON>. `` I think we keep trying without trying to face up to what really is the problem ... What's wrong with us that there are so many people who need a fix every day?'' Noting that the state had pumped million of dollars into education and treatment programs during the 1960s with little success before moving to tough punishment in 1973, then-Republican <PERSON> Assemblyman </PERSON> <PERSON> Dominick </PERSON> <PERSON> DiCarlo </PERSON> said the get-tough policy failed because it was simply too tough. <PERSON> DiCarlo </PERSON>, now a judge on the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>, also complained of the approach used in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` We would concentrate on one aspect at a time,'' said <PERSON> DiCarlo </PERSON>, who joined the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration in 1981 as the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s assistant secretary for international narcotics control. `` Hopefully, what the president is doing now is concentrating on the entire area.''

<HEAD>Dutch Voters Endorse Premier; Make Environment a Priority</HEAD>
<HEAD>By ROLAND DE LIGNY</HEAD>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>THE HAGUE, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Dutch voters have overwhelmingly endorsed Premier <PERSON> Ruud </PERSON> <PERSON> Lubbers </PERSON>' economic recovery program and given notice that cleaning up the nation's heavily polluted environment is a priority. In Wednesday's general election, <PERSON> Lubbers </PERSON>' <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeal </ORGANIZATION> party maintained its 54 seats in the 150-member <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, remaining the body's largest single party. Traditionally, the largest legislative grouping gets the premiership and <PERSON> Lubbers </PERSON>, the country's longest-serving premier in 30 years, seemed certain of a third term. Voters dealt a blow to <PERSON> Lubbers </PERSON>' errant junior partner in the center-right coalition, the right-wing Liberals, who in May toppled the government over how to finance a long-term cleanup of the environment. The Liberals, perceived by many voters as anti-environmentalist, lost five of their 27 seats on Wednesday. The opposition <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> lost three seats in the voting, keeping 49. It remained the second-largest force in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> but failed to rally the left-of-center vote around its platform of economic growth and redistribution of wealth among the 3 million people living on welfare outlays. The Green Left, an impromptu coalition of left-wing fringe parties, doubled its parliamentary contingent Wednesday to six seats and the traditionally environmentalist Democrats'66 party won 12 seats, a gain of three. The remainder of seats went to small right-wing fringe parties. The electoral blow to the Liberals and the surge in support for green parties clearly indicated voter concern over ecological issues. Earlier this year, <PERSON> Lubbers </PERSON>' government adopted a far-reaching, multibillion-dollar plan to clean up the environment in this nation that has been dubbed `` the garbage can of <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.'' The country is located on the estuary of the <LOCATION> Rhine </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s prime industrial waste artery. But the Liberals, under pressure from its affluent constituency, rejected the proposed abolition of a tax break for car commuters. The revenue was to finance the $ 3.3 billion clean-up over the next four years. The governing coalition that will now emerge is difficult to predict, and building it is expected to take months. <PERSON> Lubbers </PERSON> said Wednesday that it was possible to form a coalition with either the right or the left. Aske whether he would accept the Liberals as future coalition partners, <PERSON> Lubber </PERSON> said he `` should n't exclude any party beforehand.'' But he also told <ORGANIZATION> Dutch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> `` I see no reason why we could n't get together'' with the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, despite major differences over government austerity and industrial revitalization. A continued alliance between the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> and the Liberals, favored by the predominant part of both parties' constituencies, appears less likely because such a coupling would have just a one-seat majority But hammering out a center-left coalition of <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> would be difficult because of the wide chasm on pressing issues. Most prominent among them was how much those on welfare would share wealth generated by an economy that has recovered partly by slashing social security outlays. Other divisive issues included defense, with <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> opposed to modernizing <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s nuclear arsenals and the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> in favor, and euthanasia, which <PERSON> Lubbers </PERSON>' party wants to ban and Labor wants to legalize. The Christian Democrats' strong showing proved overwhelming voter support for <PERSON> Lubbers </PERSON>' policy of economic austerity and fiscal reform. The economy is expanding at a healthy 2.5 percent annual clip, up from near zero when <PERSON> Lubbers </PERSON> rose to power seven years ago. Consumer spending is growing 2.25 percent yearly, compared to minus 10 percent earlier in the decade. <PERSON> Lubbers </PERSON> has scheduled income tax cuts of $ 1.8 billion annually, beginning next year.

<TEXT>
 Sir <PERSON> Rudolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Bing </PERSON>'s marriage has been annulled, but his lawyer says that comes too late for the former opera impresario to finish his life in his own home. State Judge <PERSON> Carmen </PERSON> <PERSON> Ciparick </PERSON> on Wednesday granted the invalidation over the objections of <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglass </PERSON>, ending a 33-month union during which attorneys for both said the pair had lost touch with reality. As the case proceeded, the 87-year-old <PERSON> Bing </PERSON>, who suffers from Alzheimer's disease, was moved from the fashionable <ORGANIZATION> Essex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> hotel along Central Park to a nursing home. `` In 1985, he came to a 30-year friend and said, ` The one thing I really want is to stay in the <ORGANIZATION> Essex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and die there,''' said <PERSON> Bing </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldhamer </PERSON>. `` But we ran out of money and time.'' <PERSON> Goldhamer </PERSON> said hiring security and nurses to protect <PERSON> Bing </PERSON> from Ms. <PERSON> Douglass </PERSON> took up $ 400,000 to $ 450,000 of <PERSON> Bing </PERSON>'s $ 600,000 estate. What's left is mostly paintings. `` It's truly a tragic event,'' <PERSON> Goldhamer </PERSON> said. The judge denied alimony or any part of <PERSON> Bing </PERSON>'s estate to Ms. <PERSON> Douglass </PERSON>, 50, who is hospitalized in a mental ward of <LOCATION> Bellevue </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, said her lawyer, <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> Sladkus </PERSON>. <PERSON> Ciparick </PERSON> ordered <PERSON> Bing </PERSON>'s estate to pay the expenses for Ms. <PERSON> Douglass </PERSON>' hospitalization for mental problems last summer, <PERSON> Sladkus </PERSON> said. Ms. <PERSON> Douglass </PERSON>' sister and brother in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> will confer on the next legal move, <PERSON> Sladkus </PERSON> said. Ms. <PERSON> Douglass </PERSON>, who had a history of mental problems, was hospitalized in August 1988 after she `` lost touch with reality,'' he said. <PERSON> Bing </PERSON>'s legal guardian, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Guth </PERSON>, was on vacation and unavailable for comment. <PERSON> Bing </PERSON>'s first marriage lasted 54 years but ended in divorce. <PERSON> Bing </PERSON> and <PERSON> Douglass </PERSON> married Jan. 9, 1987, in a civil ceremony in <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va </LOCATION>. Attorneys for <PERSON> Bing </PERSON>, the general manager of the Metropolitan Opera for 22 years, claimed he was mentally incompetent and had no idea of what he was doing when he got married. The annulment trial began in May 1988. Almost half the couple's marriage was spent in court

<TEXT>
 The Rev. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stallings </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> is denying published reports that he had sex with an altar boy 12 years ago. `` Read my lips _ I am innocent,'' <PERSON> Stallings </PERSON> declared on <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION>'s Larry King Show on Wednesday The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported Monday that <PERSON> Stallings </PERSON>, who recently started a controversial African-American Catholic congregation, allegedly had oral sex two or three times a week with an altar boy in a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> church rectory for several months in 1977. <PERSON> Stallings </PERSON>' accuser, who was then 16 years old, gave the newspaper a signed statement saying the incident occurred, saying he never reported the relationship to church authorities. The paper agreed not to identify the man. A caller asked <PERSON> Stallings </PERSON> on the live show Wednesday night if he was considering a lawsuit against the newspaper. `` In order to sue <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>, it would take between $ 75,000 and a $ 100,0000,'' the priest responded. `` I have already sought legal counsel about this matter.'' <PERSON> Stallings </PERSON>, 41, had previously denounced the newspaper's reports, saying he would not dignify the `` scurrilous and baseless charge'' with a answer, but had not denied the charge. <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reporter <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Dedman </PERSON>, who co-wrote the article, was a caller on the show and asked <PERSON> Stallings </PERSON> if he has ever had sexual relations with the young man in question or with any man. `` <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Dedman </PERSON>, I said I would n't respond to you at all,'' <PERSON> Stallings </PERSON> said. `` I told him I do not deal with sleaze reporters and journalists, and I wo n't talk to him.'' <PERSON> Stallings </PERSON> threatened to walk off the set if pressed to answer <PERSON> Dedman </PERSON>'s question. Another caller asked <PERSON> Stallings </PERSON> if he would agree to take polygraph test to prove his innocence. `` Are you asking all the cardinals, the priests and the bishops of the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> to take a polygraph test?'' <PERSON> Stallings </PERSON> said. `` When you can ask that of every priest, bishop and cardinal, then you can ask me.'' The black priest defied <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> hierarchy by forming an independent church that blends tradition Catholic liturgy with African and gospel traditions in July. Cardinal <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hickey </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> archbishop, suspended <PERSON> Stallings </PERSON> following the first unauthorized mass at Imani Temple. In a statement released Monday, <PERSON> Hickey </PERSON> said he `` was sorry to read the allegations'' and felt great sorrow and sympathy if they were true.'' An unidentified person allegedly wrote <PERSON> Hickey </PERSON> three years ago claiming that <PERSON> Stallings </PERSON> had a sexual relationship with a male family member, The Post reported. That letter prompted a formal investigation, but the inquiry ended after the person refused to talk, unnamed sources said.

<HEAD>Woman Survives Rape, Slashing, Flees Burning Home</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DENVER (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Blindfolded, bleeding and trapped in the basement crawl space of her burning home, a rape victim scrawled her attacker's name in blood with bound hands and then made a desperate escape, authorities said. `` <PERSON> Donnie </PERSON> next door,'' she scratched on the wall Wednesday, minutes after she was raped, robbed, slashed and beaten, police said. Her home had been set on fire and she had been left to die in the crawl space sealed shut with furniture, police said. The 30-year-old woman was reported in fair condition Wednesday night at <ORGANIZATION> Denver </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>. Her head throbbing from a hammer beating and her hand bleeding from a knife wound, she had managed to kick her way out of the crawl space and break her basement window with the knife with which she was stabbed, police said. Half-nude, blood-caked and clutching the foot-long knife, the woman scaled a 6-foot fence in her backyard and ran through her neighborhood screaming for help. Police said terrified neighbors, unsure whether she was running from trouble or looking for it, shut their doors. `` People did n't want to get involved,'' said Detective <PERSON> Christine </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallis </PERSON>. But after hearing the woman's weak moans, one neighbor did phone police. `` I was in the back room working on my computer when I heard her scream, ` Help me! Somebody help me!''' the unidentified neighbor told The <ORGANIZATION> Denver </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>. `` I looked out the window to make sure it was n't some kids playing around. I saw her climbing over the fence with a knife in her hand. I went and called the police.'' As paramedics treated the woman moments later, the neighbor saw smoke flowing from her clapboard and brick house, the newspaper said. Another fire truck was summoned, and firefighters quickly doused the blaze. At the hospital, the victim underwent surgery on the sliced tendons in her hand. `` She may lose the use of her hand,'' <PERSON> Wallis </PERSON> said. Police were searching for the suspect, identified as <PERSON> Donnie </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Russell </PERSON>, 18. Detectives said they were drawing up arrest warrants charging him with attempted homicide, first-degree sexual assault, aggravated robbery, first-degree arson and felony theft. <PERSON> Wallis </PERSON> left her business card pinched in <PERSON> Russell </PERSON>'s front door shortly after police began their search for the suspect. He called the detective later in the day and promised to drive to police headquarters immediately to answer questions. He never showed up, police said. The teen-ager, whom the victim has known for two years, allegedly got into her house about 10 a.m. by asking to use her telephone, police said.

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The dollar inched up against the yen today, while share prices on the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> declined for the third consecutive day. The dollar closed at 146.87, up 0.22 yen from Wednesday's close. The currency opened at 146.20 yen, 0.45 yen lower than the previous day's close of 146.65 yen. But the dollar soared to 147.05 yen during afternoon trading before easing down to the day's close. Currency dealers said market participants were waiting on the sidelines on speculation that the West German central bank would raise key interest rates to drive the dollar lower later in the day. They said the speculation caused the West German mark to rise against the dollar, depressing the relative value of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency against other currencies, including the yen. `` When there is such speculation swirling around the market, it is hard to buy the dollar though I believe the dollar is still quite bullish,'' said a dealer with <ORGANIZATION> Daiichi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kangyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, speaking on condition of anonymity. The dealer also said many market participants share the view that the dollar has been rising too fast, and `` that led to easing of the dollar today.'' `` Traders are keeping their eyes on central banks' intervention,'' he said But another dealer with the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> said the dollar is expected to remain bullish for some time because of the strength of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy. On the stock market, the <ORGANIZATION> Nikkei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Average </ORGANIZATION> of 225 selected issues, which lost 170.64 points Wednesday, fell another 118.75 points, or 0.35 percent, to close at 34,152.56. Securities dealers attributed the bearishness of the stock market to unstable exchange rates and the weakness of the yen. `` Many investors are sidelined until the instability of exchange rates settles down,'' said a dealer at <ORGANIZATION> Nikko </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>, speaking on condition of anonymity. He added that buying incentives are increasing in the market though `` the Nikkei average is not improving yet,'' he said. The volume traded on the first section of the exchange, where most major shares are listed, was estimated at a moderate 600 million shares.

<HEAD>Boston University Takes Over Chelsea School System</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHELSEA, Mass. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 When public school students returned to class there was something else beyond the usual change of new classes, new teachers and new books. There also was a new administration, run by <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. After months of sometimes bitter controversy, the private university was at the helm of the <LOCATION> Chelsea </LOCATION> public school system. It is the beginning of a 10-year experiment to see if academia's resources can make a difference `` It's like Christmas morning and we're ready to go,'' said <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharp </PERSON>, an assistant dean at <ORGANIZATION> BU </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION>, as students returned to class Wednesday. `` We're off to a positive start as far as the university was concerned.'' Despite the fanfare, there was little evidence of the university's new role. Signs welcomed students and university officials in Vietnamese, <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> and Spanish, reflecting the native tongues of a third of the student body. There also was talk of new computer system and a special program for truants. But the university has longer-term goals than improving attendance or school equipment. University officials talk of creating a new climate in this working class community of 26,000. There are plans to teach parents about nutrition, child care, even neo-natal care with the idea of preparing children for school long before they can read or write. `` We're talking about a philosophy that education can emancipate the underclass in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Greer </PERSON>, dean of education who oversees the management team. But there are many who still have doubts about the university's involvement in the local schools The teacher's union and Hispanic parents have filed separate suits challenging the agreement. Others are worried the city may be left in deeper debt if the university does n't raise the $ 2 million to $ 3 million it promised for special programs this year. `` I'm concerned we may get stuck if the money does n't come in,'' said <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> McBride </PERSON>, chairwoman of the <ORGANIZATION> Chelsea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. `` We just keep getting deeper and deeper.'' The unique agreement between the university and <ORGANIZATION> Chelsea </ORGANIZATION> follows years of hard times for 3,500-student system. An influx of immigrants from <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> swelled the school population; declining tax revenues cut school budgets. <PERSON> Chelsea </PERSON> spends $ 1,600 less per student than the national average. Test scores, graduation rates and teacher salaries are among the state's lowest. Seeking help, school committee members approached <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Silber </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> who has long sought to use his school's resources in public education. After months of negotiations among the school committee, aldermen and the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION>, an agreement was reached in June giving the university control. While planners have talked about new courses and individualized teaching plans, an emphasis has been placed on preparing children and their parents for school. This spring, the university experimented with a literacy program for mothers and their young children. There are other plans for parental courses in nutrition, and classes for expectant mothers, all aimed at improving the health of future students. `` You ca n't just prepare the teachers and the building if you want a successful school system,'' said <PERSON> Greer </PERSON>. `` You have to prepare the students and their families.'' But the ambitious plans require money. University officials talked of raising $ 50 million through the life of its contract with <PERSON> Chelsea </PERSON>. While more money is expected, only $ 726,000 in pledges are in hand. And there are other concerns. <PERSON> Chelsea </PERSON>'s teachers are mindful of <PERSON> Silber </PERSON>'s stormy relations with his university's unions; Hispanics, fearful the new management might end bilingual education, went to court to try to stop the takeover. The university has tried to soothe those fears, appointing a management team with several bilingual experts, including <PERSON> Diana </PERSON> <PERSON> Lam </PERSON>, a Peruvian-born <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> school administrator, picked to be <PERSON> Chelsea </PERSON>'s new school superintendent The union has signed an interim contract with BU that gives teachers an average bonus of $ 1,300. `` There was some apprehension on the part of the teachers,'' said <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinstein </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Chelsea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teachers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>. `` Now they've adopted a wait-and-see attitude. Ms. <PERSON> Lam </PERSON> realizes it will take more than goodwill programs to end complaints and concerns within the community. `` We are not going to smooth over or dismiss these problems. We have to deal with the emotions and find a common ground,'' she said. `` But what we do is what should count. That is how we should be judged.''

 <PERSON> Paula </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> does n't mind being known as a former Laker Girl but the four MTV Video Music Awards showered on her `` Straight Up'' video should help sideline the cheerleader image. `` You do n't want to see me weep, do you?'' she asked the audience Wednesday night as `` Straight Up'' collected trophies for best female video, dance, choreography and editing. `` I owe a lot to being a Laker Girl,'' the ex-cheerleader for the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> basketball team said backstage. Only nominations for best new artist and breakthrough video did n't pan out. <PERSON> Madonna </PERSON>, veteran rocker <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> and newcomers Living Colour also were top winners at the sixth-annual event. Young's satirical `` This Note's for You'' won the coveted best video award, although <ORGANIZATION> MTV </ORGANIZATION> once banned the video, ostensibly because it contained commercial messages. <PERSON> Madonna </PERSON> won the Viewers' Choice trophy for `` Like a Prayer.'' Her `` Express Yourself'' video earned direction honors for <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Fincher </PERSON>, the art direction trophy for <PERSON> Vance </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzini </PERSON>, and best cinematography for <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Plummer </PERSON>. `` I guess this means you like me, you really like me,'' <PERSON> Madonna </PERSON> told the crowd in a joking echo of actress <PERSON> Sally </PERSON> <PERSON> Field </PERSON>'s `` You like me'' acceptance speech at the 1984 Oscars. `` And I'd like to thank <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION> for causing so much controversy.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cola </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in April withdrew its TV commercial featuring <PERSON> Madonna </PERSON> and its sponsorship of her tour. The commercial featured a burning cross and other images that offended some Christians. Living Colour, a band that blends rock, funk, reggae and jazz, won the best group, new artist and stage performance awards for `` Cult of Personality.''

 A <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> jetliner nearly collided with a military plane near <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> because the commerical plane's pilot obeyed an air traffic controller's instruction intended for another airliner, a federal agency said. <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> Flight 818, a <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 767 carrying 151 passengers, was flying non-stop from <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> on Tuesday when it was forced to dive to avoid the collision at 37,000 feet.

<TEXT>
 Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> called the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's `` Star Wars'' missile defense strategy unrealistic and unveiled a less expensive, revised version called `` Brilliant Pebbles.'' Instead of the system that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said would end the danger of nuclear war by making atomic weapons `` impotent,'' the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration is supporting Brilliant Pebbles, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said in an interview published in today's <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> Times. `` We have redefined Star Wars and put it into missions, requirements, doctrine and strategy much differently than we did in the early 1980s,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said. Under Brilliant Pebbles, clusters of mini-missiles would track incoming rockets. The system is intended only to cope with a limited Soviet attack or with the sort of missile strike that could be mounted by a Third World country or some other nation that might acquire a small arsenal of relatively unsophisticated rockets. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> declined to estimate the cost, but said it would be cheaper than the previous administration's concept. He conceded that former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s plan, known formally as the Strategic Defense Initiative, was never authentic. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> `` talked about this impenetrable shield that was going to be completely leakproof,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said. `` I believe that, in the semantics of let's say political jargon, that that was acceptable,'' he said. `` But it clearly was stretching the capability of a strategic defense system.'' As a partial defense system, Star Wars might be effective, but supporters admit it would be nearly useless defending a city because a single warhead that got through could cause tremendous damage and loss of life. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said that in addition to blocking a limited Soviet attack, the defense envisioned by the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration may protect the country from accidental missile launches or from attacks by other nations that recently have acquired missile technology. He said that Brilliant Pebbles may be better received by the Soviets and help U.S.-Soviet negotiations to reduce strategic offensive weapons. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> has insisted on stringent limits on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> missile defense program as part of any strategic arms agreement. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, who still considers the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> a dangerous adversary, cautioned that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> must not be duped by apparent sweeping changes in the communist bloc. `` I think we have to get away from the wild euphoria that somehow this transition and change is going to come in the real near term,'' he said. `` We are very heartened by what's happened in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> has made tremendous progress. We're heartened by what is beginning to happen in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. But we're also realists. `` Let us remind ourselves that we're still dealing with a totalitarian government and there are going to be bumps along the transition.''

<HEAD>Tests Help Predict Early Recurrence of Breast Cancer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 By checking cancerous tissue for one protein, doctors believe they can help predict which women with early breast cancer are at high risk of spreading cancer, according to a report published today. Doctors who experimented with this approach found that by testing for the protein, called haptoglobin-related protein, they could identify women who had an extremely high risk of recurrence. They said that the presence of the protein `` appears to be a powerful primary discriminator between clinically aggressive and clinically indolent breast cancers.'' Its prediction power is `` dramatically improved'' when it is combined with information about the sensitivity of the tumors to the hormone progesterone. The research was conducted by Dr. <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuhajda </PERSON> and colleagues at <ORGANIZATION> Johns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hopkins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION> and published in the New England Journal of Medicine. The study was based on 70 patients with early breast cancer who were treated by mastectomy from 1977 through 1985. Doctors checked samples of their tumor tissue for the protein as well as sensitivity to progesterone. Overall, the cancer returned in 31 women. The study found that it recurred in 91 percent of those whose tumors produced the protein but were not sensitive to progesterone. By contrast, it recurred in 24 percent who showed no signs of the hormone but were sensitive to progesterone. Doctors hope that such information will help them identify women who might benefit from aggressive early therapy, such as chemotherapy and mastectomy rather than lump removal.

<HEAD>Therapies Aimed at Blood Vessel Protein May Avert Malaria Complications</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MALCOLM RITTER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 New therapy to block malaria infection from harming the brain may result from a study that implicates a protein in that problem and other serious complications of the disease, researchers say. Scientists reported today that red blood cells infected with a malaria-causing parasite stick to the protein, which is found in the inner lining of blood vessels. Attachment of infected red cells to vessel walls is thought to play an important part in producing complications of malaria, said researcher <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Berendt </PERSON>. For example, it makes red cells clog some blood vessels of the brain. The clogging is a key factor in cerebral malaria, a complication reponsible for more than half the world's deaths from malaria, said scientist <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Fajardo </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Berendt </PERSON> said that if further work demonstrates that the protein plays a key role in cerebral malaria, finding drugs aimed at dislodging the red cells from the protein may prove useful. <PERSON> Berendt </PERSON>, of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Radcliffe </PERSON> <PERSON> Hospital </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Oxford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, and colleagues there describe their work in the British journal Nature. The protein is called intercellular adhesion molecule-1, or ICAM-1. Two other proteins, called CD36 and thrombospondin, had previously been implicated as possible attachment sites for infected red cells. But studies suggested those proteins could not account for all cases of red cell attachment, <PERSON> Berendt </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. That led to the work that implicates ICAM-1, and there may be still more blood vessel proteins involved, <PERSON> Berendt </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Fajardo </PERSON>, a pathology professor at <LOCATION> Stanford </LOCATION>, said the findings were very important. Fewer than 1 percent of the world's estimated 100 million to 200 million annual malaria cases are thought to progress to cerebral malaria, but it probably kills more than 500,000 people a year in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> alone, he said. The condition can be treated with quinine, but new drugs would be welcome because quinine does not always work and because it has undesirable side effects, <PERSON> Fajardo </PERSON> said. Malaria occurs after a parasite is injected into the bloodstream from the bite of a mosquito. The Nature paper shows that red blood cells infected by the most dangerous species of malaria parasite, Plasmodium falciparum, can stick to the protein ICAM-1. That protein is widely distributed in the inner linings of capillaries, the tiny blood vessels where red cells can attach themselves in malaria, researchers said. In the test tube, red cells infected by a parasite strain from <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> stuck to the ICAM-1 protein on the surface of tissue cells. Red cells infected by a strain from <LOCATION> Gambia </LOCATION> did not. The rate of binding increased after the tissue cells were exposed to tumor necrosis factor, a natural substance known to stimulate production of ICAM-1. <PERSON> Fajardo </PERSON> said that fits in with research that found higher levels of tumor necrosis factor in malaria patients who suffered cerebral malaria than patients who did not. The British researchers are now preparing to test a range of parasite strains to see how widespread the affinity for ICAM-1 is, <PERSON> Berendt </PERSON> said. In the Nature paper, they suggested that the severity of a case of malaria may depend on red cell affinity for various blood vessel proteins, as determined by the infecting parasite, and the infected person's levels of those proteins.

<HEAD>Study: Women's Cholesterol Changes After Menopause</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The discovery of sharp changes in women's blood cholesterol levels during menopause may help explain why their heart attack risk soars when they reach their 50s, according to a report published today. In the research, doctors measured changes in two main components of cholesterol _ high density lipoprotein, or HDL, and low density lipoprotein, or LDL _ as women reached the change of life. HDL protects against heart disease, while LDL increases the risk. The researchers found that women's HDL levels dropped four milligrams per deciliter of blood when they went through menopause, while their LDL rose 12 milligrams. Dr. <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Matthews </PERSON> said the study supports the idea that `` the menopause does lead to increased risk of coronary artery disease in women because of the negative changes in lipids.'' While heart disease is rare in women before menopause, their risk increases 10-fold after age 55. <PERSON> Matthews </PERSON>, a researcher at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION>, directed the study, which was published in the New England Journal of Medicine. The study found that when menopausal women took estrogen supplements, there was little change in their blood cholesterol levels. <PERSON> Matthews </PERSON> said more study will be necessary before researchers recommend routine use of estrogen to protect against heart disease. Estrogen supplements after menopause have been linked with an increase risk of some forms of cancer. She said that women should become more aware of their cholesterol as they reach menopause. `` As women enter the period when they likely to undergo menopause, which is around 50, it's an ideal time for them to have their cholesterol levels regularly checked,'' she said. `` If they begin to experience declines in HDL or increases in LDL, it would be very useful to alter dietary factors and exercise to have a more health-promoting lifestyle.'' The study began with 541 women between ages 42 and 50 who had not undergone menopause. Over the next 2 -LCB- years, 101 of them stopped menstruating, and 32 of these women began taking estrogen supplements. Their HDL and LDL levels were compared to those of women the same age who had not reached menopause.

 A <LOCATION> Yugoslavian </LOCATION> diplomat and a bank chairman have been cleared of conspiring to launder nearly $ 3.5 million provided by undercover agents posing as mobsters, but a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> businessman has been found guilty. <PERSON> Hubert </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON>, an admitted money launderer, testified he lied when he told investigators that 48-year-old <PERSON> Bahrudin </PERSON> <PERSON> Bijedic </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s consul general in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, gave him consular seals, which bar <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials from opening packages, and an official courier letter to help him transport cash to <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>. `` In 10 years I've represented many not guilty people, but only four innocent men. <PERSON> Bijedic </PERSON> was one of them,'' attorney <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Goode </PERSON> said.

Businessman <PERSON> Vjekoslav </PERSON> <PERSON> Spanjol </PERSON>, 42, of <LOCATION> Plano </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, was convicted too and faces a sentence of about 60 years in prison and a $ 4.1 million fine, Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarmousakis </PERSON> said. Lawyer <PERSON> Denver </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarty </PERSON> said he would appeal Spanjol's conviction <PERSON> Vince </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON>, the bank's lawyer, could not be reached after the verdict. `` I thought it was entirely possible that he'd be found not guilty on everything.

 An exile's life is not what <PERSON> Wu'er </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaixi </PERSON> wanted, but he took a leading role in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s student uprising last spring and when the dust had settled was on his government's most-wanted list Wu'er, a student at <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Normal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, made a dangerous 10-day journey to escape his homeland. Now he's starting over as a student at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, but he told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday his eye is still on the battle back home. `` If you experience that kind of massacre it changes your life,'' said Wu'er. `` Whenever I think of my friends who were murdered in <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>, I feel the obligation.'' The <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> here is now his focus. It's through this hub's telephones, fax machines and computers that he works to effect change back home. In June, the events in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> riveted the world and millions saw Wu'er's drawn face as he stood up to Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> and demanded a dialogue. Then came the quiet morning after troops stormed the square, killing hundreds, maybe thousands. Only a few who fled could carry on in the wake of such force. He and his girlfriend navigated <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s backroads for 10 days before they finally reached the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> and what seemed the only route to go. `` The first step I took was into the sea, and I knew that I would n't go back,'' he said. `` I did n't feel anything because it was just after the massacre and my feelings were already frozen.'' Those few, bloody days last spring also numbed the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> people, but they did not cower, Wu'er said. `` This is a famous face now,'' the tall, muscular man said. `` But in the city and in the country, the people protected me. Even people who I did n't know kept quiet and immediately showed support,'' said Wu'er, who tried to find a way out of the country from eight cities before succeeding. The people did n't like the government before, but dislike has been displaced by hatred since their sons and daughters were gunned down in June, Wu'er said. He and many other exiled students, their supporters and those who remain at work underground in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, are getting the word out and forming unions. `` We are n't organized officially, of course, because the government does n't want it,'' said Wu'er, who refused to provide many details on the escape. `` But we can establish a voice outside <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>.'' He said that on a recent trip to <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> he helped form a group called <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> as a central organization to coordinate efforts outside of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. He said a congress would be held later this month in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> to set an agenda and elect a governing board. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s largest newspaper recently featured Wu'er, complete with various statements about his character _ all derisive. But the insults do n't vex him. `` They're paying a lot of attention to what we're doing outside. And that means they're scared,'' said Wu'er. Wu'er says chance played a large part in his own place in the spotlight. `` When I was a freshman -LRB- in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> -RRB- I loved beer and parties, like <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> kids,'' he said. `` But the political and economic situation forced me to think about the country's system ... `` I stood in the front because I care about my self-worth,'' Wu'er, who will study English in his first semester at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>, said through a translator. `` I stood in front because the government does n't allow ... the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> people to realize their own self-worth.''

 It's being called Love Canal II and lately a trailer park where toxic contamination was discovered has begun to resemble the infamous toxic waste site just three miles away. A house at the entrance to the Forest <PERSON> Glen </PERSON> trailer park, one of two non-trailers in the subdivision of 53 families, was the first to be boarded up Monday. The house's owner, <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Bauer </PERSON>, has relocated to <LOCATION> Lewiston </LOCATION>, about 10 miles north of <LOCATION> Niagara </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>. The <PERSON> Bauer </PERSON> family was one of 23 households in <LOCATION> Forest </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Glen </LOCATION> where traces of benzothiazole, a carcinogenic industrial chemical, were found. The federal <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said the amounts in the homes were so small that they are not a health concern. Nonetheless, the <PERSON> Bauers </PERSON> left a sofa on their front lawn with the words `` Danger Contaminated'' spray-painted on it. Such displays were common 11 years ago when dioxin and other contaminants were discovered at the <LOCATION> Love </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> neighborhood. Eventually, 1,030 families were evacuated from a 10-block area around the former chemical dump site. <LOCATION> Forest </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Glen </LOCATION>, home to some of the people who left <LOCATION> Love </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION>, also was built on a toxic dump. <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Basile </PERSON> said the <PERSON> Bauers </PERSON>' property will be padlocked and that a private security force has been hired to patrol the area. Despite the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s recommendation to leave the neighborhood, some residents said they did not want to move away temporarily because they were afraid their homes would be looted. Many homes in Love Canal were vandalized after the evacuations. The dilapidated homes still stand as a monument to environmental disaster, although some have been torn down as part of a plan to revitalize the area. Federal officials have made no determination on the long-term future of <LOCATION> Forest </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Glen </LOCATION>. Until residents are out, there can be no excavations to determine the extent of the contamination, officials said. As of Monday, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> had taken 24 applications for temporary relocation, said spokesman <PERSON> Bert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallowing </PERSON>. Of those, six have moved off-site, eight have found new residences and are waiting to move, and 10 others are still looking. Twenty-three other families are considering moving their trailers out of the park. Six families have not announced plans and are believed to be waiting for the federal buyout, which is expected to take up to a year. <PERSON> Basile </PERSON> said once families moved, the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> will board up their homes to protect them from vandalism.

 Greek objections to <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> proposals on limiting military maneuvers in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> prevented their introduction as East and West resumed their search today for ways to reduce the armies and weapons massed across <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Diplomats who asked not to be identified said the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> proposals required further consultation after <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> began voicing objections to them early in the week. <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> diplomats in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> worked hard Wednesday to put the finishing touches to the proposal, billed by senior officials as an unprecedented effort to curb military exercises on the world's most heavily armed continent. But <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> objected to provisions mandating that maneuvers requiring the callup of 40,000 or more reservists and the use of 1,200 or more armored personnel carriers be announced in advance, diplomatic sources said. <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION>, which is traditionally wary of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> ally and neighbor <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>, was seeking lower limits, they said, adding they viewed this as a `` psychological problem'' that could be overcome. <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact also hope during this six-week round to present what both sides bill as sweeping proposals on verification. But diplomats from both military blocs, speaking on condition of anonymity, have suggested they are finding it difficult to reconcile interests within their two alliances. <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ledogar </PERSON> said in an interview Wednesday that `` some tough problems'' have so far blocked a <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> compromise on verification proposals. He mentioned specifically differences between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, which are pushing for maximum verification, and European nations that are concerned this would mean almost constant visits by military inspectors from the Soviet bloc. But both <PERSON> Ledogar </PERSON> and a diplomat from another <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> nation expressed confidence the verification proposals would be ready during the current round of talks. Soviet ambassador <PERSON> Oleg </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Grinevsky </PERSON>, in an interview with <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> ZDF </ORGANIZATION> television station, announced <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact intentions of introducing sweeping verification proposals he billed as bolder than anything <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> could produce. Reiterating offers Western diplomats said had been made during earlier closed-door negotiations, <PERSON> Grinevsky </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> would even be prepared to countenance the permanent stationing of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> officers on its territory to check its compliance with eventual accords to cut <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s non-nuclear weapons. He revealed no other details. The 23-nation <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> talks opened in March and, despite continuing differences over definitiions of weapons and which categories to cut first, have moved along briskly. Most diplomats at the talks have dismissed President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s goal of agreement by year's end as too optimistic. But <PERSON> Ledogar </PERSON> said he thought it realistic to aim for some agreements by next year. <PERSON> Grinevsky </PERSON> also told West German television that 1990 was a realistic target for preliminary agreement, after what he called the `` unique breakthrough'' achieved in the first two rounds of talks. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has proposed limiting the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to no more than 275,000 troops outside their borders in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The West wants no more than 20,000 tanks, 16,500 artillery pieces and 28,000 armored troop carriers for each alliance. On the sensitive issue of aircraft, identifed by both East and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> as the biggest stumbling block of the talks, <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> proposes that East and West each be limited to no more than 5,700 combat aircraft and 1,900 combat helicopters. No one country could have more than 3,420 combat aircraft and 1,140 combat helicopters. The <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact in March proposed to reduce six kinds of weapons, including aircraft, by 10 to 15 percent by 1994, cutting by a further 25 percent by 1997 and moving to purely defensive forces by the year 2000. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, which under <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is clearly anxious to save on military spending to meet pressing consumer demands at home, has also begun unilateral troop withdrawals from eastern <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Some 50,000 <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> soldiers and 5,000 tanks are to leave <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> by the end of 1990.

 Rebels in northern <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> say they have taken four more towns, including a strategic government garrison, in an offensive that began last week. The clandestine radio of the <ORGANIZATION> Tigray </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday the rebels had captured the garrison town of <LOCATION> Weldiya </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Wollo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Province </LOCATION>, killing 103 government soldiers and capturing 26.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>'s 156-year-old sodomy law can not be applied to consenting married couples, a judge ruled in clearing a man who spent 18 months in prison for having oral sex with his wife. A lawyer for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> lauded the ruling Wednesday as a step toward getting rid of `` this monstrous statute.'' Superior Court Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Castellani </PERSON> said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Moseley </PERSON>, a 35-year-old carpenter, had been imprisoned illegally. He was serving a two-year term. `` Government has no business with a married couple's private consentual sexual practices,'' <PERSON> Castellani </PERSON> wrote. <PERSON> Moseley </PERSON>'s `` right to marital and domestic privacy has been violated by the sodomy law as applied to him.'' `` Whew! I feel like someone took a millstone from around my neck,'' said <PERSON> Moseley </PERSON>, apparently the first person convicted under the law for conduct between marriage partners. The judge had freed him last week pending a decision. Attorney General <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowers </PERSON> said the state may appeal after an examination of whether the ruling might reach beyond married couples. <PERSON> Bowers </PERSON> said he agreed that the sodomy law can not be applied to consenting married couples. But the prosecutor had argued that the evidence suggested <PERSON> Moseley </PERSON>'s wife did not consent to the sodomy. `` I think at least all married couples can celebrate,'' said <PERSON> Clive </PERSON> <PERSON> Stafford-Smith </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> lawyer who represented <PERSON> Moseley </PERSON>. `` They can bring out the champagne. But there are still a large number of nervous people in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> who are not married.'' <PERSON> Moseley </PERSON>'s common-law wife, <PERSON> Bette </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>, had accused him of forcing himself on her and she filed a complaint in 1988 that led to <PERSON> Moseley </PERSON> being charged with rape, and aggravated, or forcible, oral and anal sodomy. <PERSON> Moseley </PERSON> denied using force and was acquitted on those counts but was found guilty of the lesser charge of oral sodomy after admitting the couple had oral sex. <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> law makes oral sex a crime even between consenting adults. The judge said that the jury's acquittal of <PERSON> Moseley </PERSON> on the rape and aggravated sodomy charges meant it believed no force had been involved. <PERSON> Castellani </PERSON> cited a recent <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling that upheld application of the sodomy law against homosexuals. The majority decision in that case acknowledged the law might not hold up if applied to married couples.

<HEAD>Businesses Increase Capital Spending Plans</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government reported today that <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> businesses plan to increase spending on plants and equipment by 7.7 percent in 1989, a sign that many company managers do not believe a recession is imminent. Businesses responding to a <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> survey completed in August said they expected to spend $ 463.95 billion for expansion and modernization this year, up from a record $ 430.74 billion spent on business investment in 1988. The 1988 figure was revised from $ 423.69 billion reported earlier. The numbers are adjusted for inflation. Some economists had feared that business leaders would be inclined to cut back on capital spending if they felt a severe economic slowdown was on the horizen. There was concern earlier this year that the economy, now approaching its seventh year of growth, might be headed for a recession as the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> tightened credit in an attempt to contain inflation. However, interest rates began creeping down last spring and a number of statistics since then have shown an economy that is slowing, though not as fast as previously thought. The new estimate for capital spending this year shows businesses were increasing their plans for plant and equipment spending as the year wore on. An earlier survey released in June found businesses planning to increase spending by 6.5 percent. A March survey indicated a 6.3 percent increase. In an even earlier survey of 1989 business investment plans, conducted last December, companies had estimated their capital spending could rise 5.9 percent this year. Economists generally interpret plant and equipment spending as a plus for the economy because it indicates continued expansion and eases inflationary pressures by increasing productive capacity. Capital spending grew a revised 8.9 percent in 1988, the department said, as companies rushed to expand production to meet rising export demand. Spending climbed a revised 4.2 percent in 1987 and dropped 3.9 percent in 1986. In the latest survey, manufacturing companies said they planned a 6.1 percent increase in capital outlays to $ 178.24 billion, compared to a revised 11.7 percent in 1988. This includes a 2.8 percent rise in plants that produce durable goods, big-ticket items expected to last three years or more, and a 9.1 percent increase in companies producing non-durable goods. Companies engaged in mining, transportation and other non-manufacturing ventures are expected to increase spending by 8.7 percent to $ 285.72 billion. Before adjusting for inflation, 1989 plant and equipment spending is expected to rise 10 percent to $ 473.65 billion, down from 10.5 percent in 1988.

 Four veteran <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> members have been convicted of making thousands of dollars through corruption, a government newspaper reported today. The Economic Daily said the officials admitted their guilt and are awaiting sentencing. It said they were expelled from the party. The officials, three from the northeast province of <LOCATION> Heilongjiang </LOCATION> and one from Inner <LOCATION> Mongolia </LOCATION>, have been members of the party for at least 40 years. Also today, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> welcomed its first foreign head of state to the country since the June 3-4 military attack on pro-democracy protesters. President <PERSON> Blaise </PERSON> <PERSON> Compaore </PERSON> of the western <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> country of <PERSON> Burkina </PERSON> <PERSON> Faso </PERSON> was welcomed in Tiananmen Square with a 21-gun salute. `` You are the first head of state since we quelled the counterrevolutionary rebellion,'' President <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> <PERSON> Shangkun </PERSON> said to <PERSON> Compaore </PERSON> after the ceremony. The Economic Daily said <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> <PERSON> Lizhong </PERSON>, former head of the <ORGANIZATION> Petrochemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> bureaus in <LOCATION> Heilongjiang </LOCATION>; and <PERSON> Guan </PERSON> <PERSON> Wenbin </PERSON>, former vice-director of the Daqing Petrochemical factory, purchased 200 tons of benzene and 1,000 tons of petroleum coke at lower state-set prices and then sold the materials on the open market. <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> made $ 5,135 on the deals and <PERSON> Guan </PERSON> received $ 5,400, the paper said. The newspaper quoted <PERSON> Guan </PERSON> as saying after his arrest: `` My wife and children work, my family's living conditions are pretty good. I used to not pay much attention to money, but now I'm old and selfish, I was thinking too much of myself ... It's a bitter lesson.'' <PERSON> Yao </PERSON> <PERSON> Zhiwu </PERSON>, an engineer and party official in <LOCATION> Inner </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mongolia </LOCATION>, was convicted of accepting bribes totaling $ 5,400 from two construction companies. `` I was so stupid,'' the newspaper quoted <PERSON> Yao </PERSON> as saying. `` I have enough money _ I just thought that if I had a little more, things would be more convenient.'' <PERSON> Yao </PERSON> conceded he committed the crime because his `` capitalistic world vision had not been completely reformed.'' <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Kexiang </PERSON>, former vice-director of the <ORGANIZATION> Daqing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petrochemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Factory </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Heilongjiang </LOCATION>, also accepted bribes of $ 2,700. `` My will power is too weak,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> quoted him as saying. The newspaper said they are awaiting sentencing. Corruption was a key issue raised by students during the nationwide pro-democracy movement this spring. After the crackdown of the movement, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> announced a major anti-corruption campaign that would include top government officials and party members. Most of the cases involved officials who obtain large supplies of scarce raw materials at low government-set prices and then sell them for large profits on the free market. The visit by <PERSON> Compaore </PERSON> was the first by a head of state since President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> visited in mid-May, when the student-led protests that began April 15 reached their peak. Up to 1 million people crowded <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>, forcing humiliated officials to cancel ceremonies planned for <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> in the vast plaza. <PERSON> Compaore </PERSON> was welcomed by <PERSON> Yang </PERSON>, one of the key figures behind the government's decision to send troops to crush the student demonstrators. Hundreds, perhaps thousands, were believed killed in the crackdown. `` Your excellency and other African leaders have fully understood and supported the quelling of the counter-revolutionary rebellion in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. That's why we have to thank you,'' <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> told <PERSON> Compaore </PERSON>. High-level diplomatic contacts with the West have been largely frozen since the crackdown, with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and other Western countries condemning the Chinese leadership for its violent suppression of the student movement.

In an unrelated development today, prosecutors indicted two Roman Catholic priests for sending a fellow priest to escort home a South Korean radical student who had made an illegal trip to Communist <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Yoo </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> have been active in a campaign opposing <ORGANIZATION> Universal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION> releases in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Yoo </PERSON> also reportedly collected funds from movie producers to launch campaign against the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> films. Police said <PERSON> Yoo </PERSON> arranged a firebomb attack Aug. 13 on <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Cine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> The theater was partly burned, but no injuries were reported. The non-poisonous snakes were released into another theater last year. <ORGANIZATION> Universal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION> has faced a boycott campaign by South Korean film workers since its first film, `` Fatal Attraction,'' was shown in September. The South Korean film industry wants to handle the distribution of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> films itself, rather than see a foreign company do it. A trade law adopted last year allowed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies to bypass South Korean distributors by releasing films directly to cinemas. Revs. <PERSON> Nam </PERSON> <PERSON> Kook-hyun </PERSON>, 40, and Park Byong-jun, 37, were charged with sending a fellow priest, <PERSON> Moon </PERSON> <PERSON> Gyu-hyon </PERSON>, to accompany a radical student across the border with <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> on Aug. 15 after her illegal trip to the North. If prosecutors from the <ORGANIZATION> Seoul </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prosecutors </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> win convictions for the priests, they could receive up to seven years in prison. The radical student, Im Su-kyong, 20, will be formally indicted Friday on charges of making an illegal trip to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> to attend a World Youth Festival there July 1-8, prosecution officials said. If she is found guilty, she could receive up to 10 years in prison under the National Security Law. Im, a student at <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Hankuk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, said her <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> trip was aimed at promoting unification of the divided <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> peninsula. Her arrest touched off violent anti-government protests by radical students in the South. Radicals stepped up anti-government protests to press their demand for the release of Im, whom they described as `` the flower of unification.'' <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> bans unauthorized trips to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, an enemy country since the division of the <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> peninsula </LOCATION> in 1945. The two Koreas fought a three-year war in the early 1950's.

<TEXT>
 A court today began hearing an $ 810 million lawsuit against <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> based on the former president's tax returns. It is the first case against <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> that has gone to trial in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> since he was ousted three years ago. In all, the government has filed 35 civil suits since in 1987 to recover $ 100 billion that <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> and 300 associates are accused of stealing during his 24 years in power. He was forced into exile in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> after a popular-military uprising ousted him in February 1986. Solicitor General <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON> said he expects to call as many as 20 witnesses and hopes the trial will persuade courts in <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> and elsewhere to speed up proceedings to recover money <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> allegedly invested abroad. `` This is the first real, significant step toward the recovery of ill-gotten wealth,'' <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON> said. In the case, being heard in the nation's anti-graft court, the government is seeking $ 476 million in damages and recovery of up to $ 334 million in property <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Imelda </PERSON>, allegedly purchased in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Government lawyers said they will argue that <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> and his wife owned properties worth far more than they could afford based on assets declared in income tax returns. Assistant Solicitor General <PERSON> Romeo </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> la </PERSON> <PERSON> Cruz </PERSON> told the three-judge panel that <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' presidential annual salary totaled $ 71,000 for his nearly quarter-century in power. Mrs. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> earned $ 34,000 during nine years as minister of human settlements and governor of the <ORGANIZATION> Metro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manila </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, de la <PERSON> Cruz </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Eliseo </PERSON> <PERSON> Pitargue </PERSON>, intelligence chief of the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION>, testified that between 1960 and 1984, the couple declared total assets equivalent to $ 657,000 at current exchange rates. They paid nearly $ 271,000 in income taxes in that time, <PERSON> Pitargue </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON> said <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' tax records will `` establish the patently gross and scandalously disproportionate acquisition of Mr. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> on the basis of his declared wealth.'' <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' lawyers, <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON> <PERSON> Recto </PERSON> and <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> David </PERSON>, were in the courtroom but told reporters they are not representing the couple. <PERSON> Recto </PERSON> said he will report to <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> on the proceedings. `` This is all a big charade,'' <PERSON> Recto </PERSON> told reporters before the proceedings adjourned until Friday. `` This case will take about 100 years more.'' <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> had insisted on his right to defend himself, but the court ruled he forfeited it by ignoring subpoenas delivered to his <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> home. President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>, <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' successor, has refused to allow him to return, citing national security. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> is reported in critical condition at a <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> hospital, where he has been confined since January with heart, kidney and lung failure. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> and his wife were indicted by a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> federal grand jury last year on racketeering charges for allegedly pillaging the Philippine treasury and investing some of the money in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> denied the charges and is free on $ 5 million bail. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> was temporarily separated from the case because of failing health. The Marcoses have never been charged with a criminal offense in a <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> court because the government fears they would invoke their constitutional right to return to face their accusers.

<TEXT>
 The city transit agency has agreed to pay at least $ 689,000 to the estate and children of a black man who was struck and killed by a subway train after being chased into a station by a gang of whites in 1982. The settlement was reached in July and made public Wednesday by the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bay </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> in response to a Freedom of Information Act request by The <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Atkinson </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, a 30-year-old janitor, died after fleeing a group of white men who chased him in the city's <LOCATION> Dorchester </LOCATION> section. In 1985, two men were convicted of manslaughter and three of assault in the attack. The settlement stemmed from a $ 10 million negligence and wrongful-death suit filed by the mothers of <PERSON> Atkinson </PERSON>'s children, ages 10 and 19. The suit alleged that <ORGANIZATION> MBTA </ORGANIZATION> workers neglected to notify police immediately when <PERSON> Atkinson </PERSON> and a friend fled into the station and failed to alert train operators that <PERSON> Atkinson </PERSON> had run onto the tracks. The suit also claimed that the train that hit <PERSON> Atkinson </PERSON> was operating without headlights. The <ORGANIZATION> MBTA </ORGANIZATION> also agreed to pay $ 138,000 to <PERSON> Atkinson </PERSON>'s estate, of which some will go to his children. The agency will also pay the children at least $ 551,000 in installments for the rest of their lives, the <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION> said today. The children are <PERSON> Atkinson </PERSON>'s sole heirs because their mothers never married him. <PERSON> Atkinson </PERSON> was walking along a street around 12:30 a.m. with a white friend, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Grady </PERSON>, when a group of whites began shouting racial epithets, hurling bottles and threatening to kill the pair, authorities said. The suit claimed that <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Davulis </PERSON>, a coin changer, failed to call police when <PERSON> Atkinson </PERSON> ran into the station and called for help. It was not until <PERSON> Davulis </PERSON> saw <PERSON> Grady </PERSON> punched that he finally called for help, the suit alleged. <PERSON> Davulis </PERSON> called police a second time after he was initially placed on hold but left for home before police arrived, the suit said. <ORGANIZATION> MBTA </ORGANIZATION> police arrived seven minutes later, looked around, saw no one, and left, the <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION> reported.

<HEAD>Mitchell Raps Proposed Tax Cut</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> today assailed a proposed capital-gains tax cut as a break for the rich that would be paid for by middle-income Americans. In addition, he said, the cut proposed by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and others would undoubtedly cause a loss of government revenue `` over any period of time beyond one year'' and thus would worsen the budget deficit. `` The present proposal is unfair, unwise,'' the <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> Democrat told reporters. It is `` effectively a tax break for the wealthy to be paid for by the middle class. It is a $ 31,000-a-year tax break for those whose income exceeds $ 200,000 a year.'' A capital-gains reduction also would unravel the big 1986 tax overhaul, <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> added. When the tax system was rewritten by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, capital gains was only one of several special tax breaks that were wiped out in order to allow a significant reduction of tax rates. Under the new law, capital gains _ profits from the sale of stock and other assets _ are taxed at the same rate as wages and other income. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has proposed to reduce the rate to 15 percent. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> reasons that if a preference is restored for capital gains, pressure will increase to bring back other benefits that were ended in 1986. In that regard, Sens. <PERSON> Alfonse </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Conn </LOCATION>., announced today they were introducing a bill to restore tax-deductible Individual Retirement Accounts for all workers, regardless of income The 1986 law restricted deductible IRAs only to lower-paid workers and those not covered by a company pension. In running for the presidency last year, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> promised to seek a reduction in the capital-gains tax in order to spur investment and saving. A majority of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> favors a temporary cut in the capital-gains tax, which could help reduce the budget deficit in the short term by prompting investors to sell some assets they have been holding for some time. However, many economists dispute the administration's contention that a capital-gains cut would produce long-term revenue gains. The Ways and <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> is weighing an alternative by Chairman <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON>, D-Ill., that would protect against taxation of gains caused solely by inflation and also provide more favorable tax treatment of long-term gains But <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said now is not the time to even consider a capital-gains cut, chiefly because of the budget deficit. He noted that in 1986, when tax overhaul was being debated, he offered an amendment that would have retained a special tax break for capital gains _ but only as part of a plan that would include a higher tax rate on income of all kinds earned by wealthier taxpayers. That amendment was defeated when 49 of the 53 Republican senators voted against it. Now, <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said, Republicans have made a complete reversal and want a lower rate for capital gains. The <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> estimates that 70 percent of the benefit of a capital-gains cut would go to those with incomes over $ 100,000 a year.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> will turn over millions of dollars to the government and open its books for inspection as it prepares to share power, the state newspaper said today. <PERSON> Imre </PERSON> <PERSON> Pozsgay </PERSON>, a reformist member of the four-man Communist leadership, made the pledge Wednesday to opposition groups discussing the political shape of <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> as the country gears up for free elections next year, the paper said. The talks, focusing on preparations for the first free elections since the 1948 Communist takeover, frequently have been bogged down. But the newspaper, <ORGANIZATION> Magyar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hirlap </ORGANIZATION>, reported some progress after the Wednesday session agreed to increase the number of seats in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> from 350 to 374. Other issues remained in dispute, it said. <ORGANIZATION> MTI </ORGANIZATION>, the state news agency, said <PERSON> Pozsgay </PERSON> was defeated in an election Wednesday of delegates to the Oct. 6 <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> congress where reformists are expected to battle orthodox Marxists over the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s future. He will have a vote at the session anyway because he is a member of the 113-member <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, but his defeat was seen as a victory for those in the party who oppose the rapid pace of reforms. Leading Communist reformist <PERSON> Zoltan </PERSON> <PERSON> Szabo </PERSON> told reporters the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s `` oligarchy is becoming active, now that they have realized that they may be in danger of losing control of the party.'' The Communist leadership decided in February to permit multiparty elections by June 1990. The decision was part of the political, social and economic reforms that have kept <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> in the forefront of change within the Soviet bloc, creating concern among leaders of more hard-line <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> countries. At the talks, opposition leaders continue to urge that only registered parties be allowed to nominate candidates, <ORGANIZATION> Magyar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hirlap </ORGANIZATION> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which still exercises some control over broad-based organizations such as the <ORGANIZATION> Patriotic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, wants them to propose candidates as well. Opposition spokesmen have made the finances and property of <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> an issue, claiming the party seized many things illegally when it took power. <PERSON> Pozsgay </PERSON>'s announcement appears calculated to defuse controversy. The paper quoted him as saying the party will hand over $ 35 million to the increasingly independent-minded government to finance the emerging multiparty system and that party books will be opened after the elections.

<HEAD>Many Latino Immigrants Say Citizenship Test Too Hard: Survey</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The overwhelming majority of Latino immigrants say they intend to stay in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, but many say they've delayed applying for citizenship because the exam is too difficult, a survey released today said `` These findings suggest that one effective method to increase <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizenship among Latino immigrants would be education and outreach activities to demystify the naturalization process,'' the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Latino </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elected </ORGANIZATION> and Appointed Officials said. In a release announcing results of the telephone survey of 1,635 immigrants in eight states, the association said such activities should also be designed to `` allay fears about the difficulty of the citizenship examination.'' The average European and Asian immigrant waits seven to eight years before naturalizing, but Hispanic immigrants wait an average of 14 to 15 years, the association said. However, once Latino immigrants take the exam, the survey said, most pass and do n't find it difficult. Rep. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Roybal </PERSON>, D-Calif., president of the association's educational fund, told a news conference the survey results are especially important `` because this is a group that many believe will not be fully counted in the next census The Latino group said its survey also showed that Hispanic immigrants are more politically active than previously believed. `` In light of the survey's findings, many of our society's assumptions about Latino immigrants will need to be re-examined,'' the group said `` Foremost among these assumptions is the perception that Latino immigrants are here temporarily and are planning to return to their homelands upon accumulation of savings or upon retirement.'' Ninety-eight percent of those interviewed said they wanted to make the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> their permanent home, and 79 percent said life in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is better than in their native country. Ninety-five percent said that an important reason for wanting to become a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizen is that it allows you to vote. Sixty-three percent of the Cubans interviewed identified themselves as Republicans, while 42 percent of Mexicans and 34 percent of other Latin Americans said they were Democrats. The study said 81 percent of the naturalized Latinos surveyed were registered to vote, compared with 70 percent of the general <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> voting age population. Paradoxically, however, 46 percent said they saw no real benefits of becoming a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizen. Difficulty of the <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> examination was cited as an important reason by 39 percent and discrimination against Latinos by 35 percent. Forty-four percent of those interviewed were naturalized citizens and the remaining 66 percent were permanent legal residents. Despite their overwhelming desire to remain in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, 17 percent of the non-naturalized Latinos said an important reason for not becoming a citizen was that they planned to return to their homeland some day. <PERSON> Rosalind </PERSON> <PERSON> Gold </PERSON>, a research associate with the Latino group, said the respondents `` may have thought about whether it was an important reason for a person not becoming a citizen, rather than really answering in the personal sense about what their personal plans were.'' The survey was conducted in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>. Nearly half of those interviewed were from <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and one-fourth from <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. The principal other countries of origin included the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION>. The survey was conducted by the educational fund of the association, which claims a membership of more than 3,300 Hispanic elected officials, appointed officials and community and business leaders. It did not give a margin of error.

 A fan who pursued <PERSON> Justine </PERSON> <PERSON> Bateman </PERSON> for months was put under psychiatric observation for holding police at bay outside a theater and threatening to kill himself if the actress did n't talk to him, authorities said. <PERSON> Bateman </PERSON>, who played shopping-crazy <PERSON> Mallory </PERSON> <PERSON> Keaton </PERSON> in the TV series `` Family Ties,'' was not inside at the time but went on stage hours later for the opening of the play `` <PERSON> Lulu </PERSON>,'' in which she has the title role of a femme fatale. Authorities said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Smetek </PERSON>, 39, of <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, imagined he was romantically involved with with the 23-year-old <PERSON> Bateman </PERSON>. He was taken to <LOCATION> Highland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> after his arrest Wednesday at the <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION> Repertory Theater. <PERSON> Smetek </PERSON> was booked for investigation of weapons offenses. Bail was set at $ 25,000. `` She just hopes that he seeks the help he needs,'' said <PERSON> Bateman </PERSON>'s publicist, <PERSON> Cindy </PERSON> <PERSON> Guagenti </PERSON>. <PERSON> Smetek </PERSON> kept police at bay for three hours, holding a loaded gun to his abdomen and forcing cancellation of a midday rehearsal. `` He just wants to talk with her and indicate his love-fixation with her,'' said Lt. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Peters </PERSON>. Earlier this year, police said, <PERSON> Smetek </PERSON> claimed to be a producer and tried to speak to <PERSON> Bateman </PERSON> at the `` Family Ties'' sound stage in <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>. He first appeared outside the <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION> theater Friday, and <PERSON> Bateman </PERSON> `` more or less brushed him off,'' <PERSON> Peters </PERSON> said. When she saw him the next day, she notified police, who questioned <PERSON> Smetek </PERSON>, but `` he really had n't committed any crimes.'' <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffoul </PERSON>, a spokesman for the theater, said the theater had hired security guards and circulated <PERSON> Smetek </PERSON>'s description among employees. `` <PERSON> Justine </PERSON> was aware that he was pursuing her and took the situation seriously,'' said <PERSON> Guagenti </PERSON>. `` It's no joke,'' said <PERSON> Griffoul </PERSON>. `` This type of thing is the worst scenario for a person in the public eye.'' The incident was the latest in a series of security threats to celebrities. On July 18, actress <PERSON> Rebecca </PERSON> <PERSON> Schaeffer </PERSON>, who appeared in the TV series `` My Sister <PERSON> Sam </PERSON>,'' was shot to death at the door to her <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> apartment.

 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is planning to use what may be the ultimate weapon against <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>: television. By the end of the year, a million or more Soviet-made TV sets are expected to tune in six hours a day, seven days a week to American-made news programs and the best reruns <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> has to offer, courtesy of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. Could programs such as `` Dynasty,'' `` Days of Our Lives'' and pro bowling lure big <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> audiences away from state-run TV? Proponents say Cubans will flock to their sets, as they apparently did with <PERSON> Radio </PERSON> <PERSON> Marti </PERSON>, and take their first uncensored look at the outside world in 30 years. But critics say TV Marti may harden anti-American attitudes in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, violate international communications laws and cause massive headaches for <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> broadcasters who may find themselves blacked out by TV <PERSON> Marti </PERSON>'s powerful signal or who may be bludgeoned by retaliatory broadcasts from <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION>. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> supports sending TV to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, as do many members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and Cuban exile groups. But the plan has faced some powerful opponents, including Sen. <PERSON> Claiborne </PERSON> <PERSON> Pell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-R.I. </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasters </ORGANIZATION>. After three years of rancorous debate over the wisdom of such an enterprise, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> this year voted money to begin TV <PERSON> Marti </PERSON> testing this fall. But the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, before it appropriated $ 7.5 million in July for a 90-day TV Marti test, agreed to hold up funds for full operation until the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> holds hearings on whether TV <PERSON> Marti </PERSON> would violate <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> treaty obligations. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> earlier authorized $ 32 million for <ORGANIZATION> TV </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> over the next two years, and the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> measures are awaiting resolution in conference committee. If the spending plan gains final congressional approval, the <ORGANIZATION> USIA </ORGANIZATION> will begin satellite relays of Spanish-language programs from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to a receiving station in Cudjoe Key, <LOCATION> Fla </LOCATION>. There, weather permitting, the signals will be fed to a transmitter aboard a giant balloon tethered two miles above the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION>, and thence to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> some 90 miles away. Cubans, TV <PERSON> Marti </PERSON> backers say, are eagerly awaiting <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> television. `` My understanding is they ca n't wait for it to start,'' <PERSON> Jacqueline </PERSON> <PERSON> Tillman </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Cuban-American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said Wednesday. `` Radio <PERSON> Marti </PERSON> has, and hopefully TV <PERSON> Marti </PERSON> will as well, provide views to the <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> people that they are not receiving.'' <PERSON> Tillman </PERSON> said <PERSON> Radio </PERSON> <PERSON> Marti </PERSON> has helped nurture human rights groups, made the <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> populace aware of the number of Cuban army casualties in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, the level of oppression in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, AIDS and the new era of openness in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bloc </LOCATION>. `` All that news is frequently censored by the Cuban government media, so the promise of TV Marti, with pictures, is very important,'' she said. Cuban officials have labeled TV <PERSON> Marti </PERSON> `` anti-Cuban propaganda'' and said they will take appropriate measures against it. When Radio <PERSON> Marti </PERSON> was launched in May 1985, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> briefly tried to jam the broadcasts. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasters </ORGANIZATION> has lobbied against <ORGANIZATION> TV </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION>, saying it could wreak havoc on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> stations, which already are subject to periodic radio blasts from enormously powerful Cuban transmitters. `` The idea is technically flawed and there are no provisions to protect <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> broadcasters from either direct interference from TV <PERSON> Marti </PERSON>'s signal or retaliatory broadcasts from <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>,'' <ORGANIZATION> NAB </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Walt </PERSON> <PERSON> Wurfel </PERSON> said Wednesday. `` <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> has demonstrated in the past it has powerful transmitters that can cause interference to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> radio stations'' from <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> and as far west as <LOCATION> Des </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Moines </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Wurfel </PERSON> said. Some Cuban-American groups also oppose TV <PERSON> Marti </PERSON>. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Cuban-American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION>, wrote recently in a <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> op-ed piece that TV <PERSON> Marti </PERSON> violates a 1982 treaty that stipulates that normal TV transmission wavelengths are for domestic, national use only. `` The creation of TV Marti would surely be perceived by <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> as a hostile act,'' <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON> said. `` The Cuban community in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> will suffer the brunt of <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s displeasure, as we did after <PERSON> Radio </PERSON> <PERSON> Marti </PERSON>, when <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> virtually closed off all family visits to the island.''

<TEXT>
 The Christian army commander, Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, today said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> decision to remove its diplomats from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> was based on `` half-truths, hearsay and downright black propaganda.'' <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> lashed out at the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> during a news conference in his underground bunker hours after another artillery battle between Christian and Moslem forces left at least two people dead and seven injured. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> staff at the <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> embassy was evacuated on Wednesday amid souring relations with <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> and a protest at the facility during which hundreds of Christians demanded the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> press <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> to end the fighting. On Saturday, the 54-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Maronite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> charged that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has `` sold <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'' out of fear for the lives of eight Americans held hostage by pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem groups in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. He compared his war against the Syrians to the American war of independence and called on the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people to support the Christians. The U.S.-trained general was clearly angered by <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON>'s remark that the 30 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomats were pulled out because he had threatened them with a `` good dose of Christian terrorism.'' She said an unidentified Christian leader told diplomats they moved in and out of the compound in the Christian sector of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> `` at their own risk.'' <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> said during the hour-long news conference that Ms. <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON>'s remark was `` a calculated but crude personal attack on me. `` It's an attack perhaps born of desperation, rather than exasperation at the continued <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> resistance, and based at best on half-truth, hearsay and downright black propaganda at which we all know the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> excels.'' <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s Ambassador to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Abdallah </PERSON> <PERSON> Bouhabib </PERSON>, also disputed the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> charge that American diplomats were exposed to terrorism. `` We think that there was no danger whatsoever for the American diplomats there,'' the envoy said. He appealed to Americans to `` support all the <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION>, Moslems and Christians, in our war of liberation'' against <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s 40,000 troops in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> who the Christians refer to as an occupation force. Police said two people were killed and seven wounded in five hours of shelling before dawn today. The fighting ended a week of diminished fighting in the six-month confrontation between <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s forces and the Syrians The deaths raised the casualty toll since the fighting erupted March 8 to at least 830 killed and 2,462 wounded, nearly all of them civilians. The artillery battles began late Wednesday, 12 hours after the American diplomats were airlifted by <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> helicopter to <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, 100 miles away.

<HEAD>Several Rockets Fired Across Jordan-Israel Border</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Attackers fired several rockets from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> into <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> today, but the shells exploded harmlessly, the military said. At least one rocket landed in <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>, officials of the Arab country said. It was the second attack in a week and the fifth this year across the normally quiet border. Israeli soldiers watched the Soviet-made Katyusha rockets sailed into the sky shortly after midnight, and found the remains of one 107mm rocket in searches this morning, the military command said in a communique. The blasts roused Israelis from sleep at a nearby kibbutz, or collective farm. The only damage was a crater in the <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>'s official news agency said one rocket landed near the border village of <LOCATION> Adasiyya </LOCATION>. In keeping with Israeli army policy, military sources declined to be more specific about where the rockets landed in the Jewish state. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s border with <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> has been a quiet frontier for years, but several recent incidents have broken the calm. Israeli officials said a Palestinian guerrilla crossed the border Saturday and killed two <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers before he was shot to death. <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> said it could find no evidence of a crossing. Another Israeli trooper was killed in a March 18 infiltration along the southern border claimed by <ORGANIZATION> Fatah-Uprising </ORGANIZATION>, a Syrian-based Palestinian group outside the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> said it arrested several people involved in that raid. The Israelis killed two Jordanian soldiers in two other border crossings this year in the north and south of the country. <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> said the two had deserted their posts. Neither <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> nor <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> use <LOCATION> Katyusha </LOCATION> rockets, but some Palestinian guerrilla factions do. <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> does not permit guerrilla attacks across its borders into <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, and it expelled <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> guerrillas in a 1970-71 civil war, sharply reducing such attempts.

 The informant who helped arrange a <ORGANIZATION> Border </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION> sting aimed at smuggling of illegal aliens was arrested on suspicion of murder after the bust went awry. One federal agent was slain and his partner wounded. Four people in all were arrested in the shooting in a convenience store parking lot early Wednesday. Agent <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Connelly </PERSON>, 42, an 18-year Border Patrol veteran, died of a gunshot wound to the chest. His partner, <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON>, also shot in the chest, was downgraded from serious to critical condition today. <PERSON> Connelly </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> had arranged through the informant, an illegal alien farmhand, to meet a group of smugglers at the store, said <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, chief <ORGANIZATION> Border </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION> agent. He said the agents posed as employers offering to pay about $ 500 for the alien and were about to make arrests when they were shot. The agents had met the informant Saturday, and he did not tell them the smugglers would be armed, <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said. After the shooting, the informant fled. Authorities could not immediately say what his role was in the shootings. `` At this time I have no idea whether or not it was a setup,'' <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said. Arrested on suspicion of murder and other, unspecified, charges were <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> <PERSON> Macias </PERSON> <PERSON> Arreola </PERSON>, 41, <PERSON> Florentino </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunez </PERSON> <PERSON> Mujica </PERSON>, 31, and <PERSON> Rosura </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, 22, all of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Serrano </PERSON> <PERSON> Saldana </PERSON>, 18, of <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>. Authorities have not identified which one was the informant. Police Capt. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Rhames </PERSON> said <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> apparently was not involved directly in the shootings. One of the downed agents fired before backup agents arrived and began shooting, <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said. It was not known if any suspects were shot, but one was bleeding, said Sgt. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Dyer </PERSON>, head of the SWAT team that sealed off the area. Two suspects sped off in a station wagon and two others ran in opposite directions, <PERSON> Dyer </PERSON> said. The car was abandoned a few blocks away. Police arrested the first suspect within an hour of the shooting, and the final suspect was dragged out of a yard around 7:20 a.m., police said.

<HEAD>Senate Panel Extends Airline Smoking Ban</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FRAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee voted today to permanently forbid smoking on all domestic airline routes, expanding the current ban covering flights lasting only two hours or less. On a unanimous voice vote, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Appropriations transportation subcommittee adopted an $ 11.9 billion spending bill for transportation programs for fiscal 1990 that includes the strengthened smoking prohibition. The 1990 fiscal year begins Oct. 1. There was no debate on the smoking provision. The full <ORGANIZATION> Appropriations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> planned to vote on the bill later in the day. Subcommittee Chairman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lautenberg </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.J. </LOCATION>, who sponsored the proposal, said he expected to prevail there but to face a tough fight from tobacco-state senators when the legislation reaches the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor next week. `` We hear rumblings in the woods that the war drums are being beaten and we expect a full-dress battle in the future,'' he said. On Aug. 3, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> adopted legislation that would permanently extend the current ban on cigarette smoking on flights of two hours or less. The existing restriction, enacted two years ago, will otherwise expire next April. House sponsor <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Durbin </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ill </LOCATION>., was blocked from offering an amendment that would have applied the prohibition to all domestic flights The ban on two-hour flights covers four out of five <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airline routes. Health groups and airline employee unions have worked for the extended ban, arguing that cigarette smoke inhaled by non-smokers can cause cancer and other diseases. Cigarette manufacturers insist that evidence of health problems is inconclusive, and say that the ban harms tobacco farmers and others who rely on cigarette sales for their livelihoods. The tobacco lobby has conceded that a permanent extension of the ban on two-hour flights is inevitable. They have even signaled that they prefer the permanent ban to a temporary one, hoping it would eliminate a renewal of debate on the issue every time the restriction expires.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> today praised `` the courage and determination'' of the government of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> for extraditing an accused major drug trafficker to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and warned against letting critics of his anti-narcotics strategy `` lose the war.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, addressing the annual convention of the American Legion, appealed to the veterans to rally behind his anti-drug and anti-crime measures to help `` free our country from the fear of drugs and crime.'' The president, recalling a now-famous campaign gaffe he made ast last year's Legion convention, also jokingly told the veterans to `` remember <LOCATION> Pearl </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> shocked the convention on Sept. 7, 1988, by saying it was Pearl Harbor Day. The day actuall is Dec. 7. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the extradition Wednesday of <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> <PERSON> Romero </PERSON>, indicted in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> on charges of laundering money for the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> drug cartel, `` sends a strong signal of the courage and determination of President <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> and the <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> government to deal with this scourge which drugs are inflicting on all of us.'' He said his $ 7.9 billion anti-drug package, unveiled in a speech to the nation Tuesday night, `` will require the bravery and sacrifice that Americans have shown before and must again.'' `` As veterans, you know how battles are often fought, house by house, block by block. Well, we'll win this battle the same way. We're going to win win it kid by kid, neighborhood by neighborhood,'' said the president. Democrats have charged the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> drug plan is underfunded and inadequate to meet the menace. To them, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> replied, `` Some, incredibly, say it's not enough. This from the very people who oppose the death penalty. It's that kind of thinking that's lost too many battles. `` So let's not let these critics lose the war,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` I ask you to support our crime plan and also the other parts of our drug strategy.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who entered the convention hall wearing his <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> 77 cap from his hometown of <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, also attacked the House-passed defense authorization bill and commended the Legion's support of his call for a constitutional amendment to protect the flag Legion officials presented him with petitions signed by a million people in support of a constitutional amendment. He said the House-passed $ 295 billion defense budget `` is totally unacceptable to the commander-in-chief of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> armed forces.'' He charged that the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> version, now headed for compromising with a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> defense bill, would `` strip money from programs crucial'' to modernizing strategic weapons, including the mobile Midgetman missile and putting the MX missile on rail cars. Recalling his campaign gaffe, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` Today surprisingly is Sept. 7. Can you believe it? And I'm determined not to repeat the mistake I made exactly one year ago when I referred to this as Pearl Harbor Day. ... As long as I live I'll remember the gasp from the audience.'' From the convention. the president went to nearby <PERSON> Fort </PERSON> <PERSON> McHenry </PERSON> for a ceremony marking the 175th anniversary of the Battle of <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> in the War of 1812 against the British, which inspired <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Key </PERSON> to write `` The Star-Spangled Banner.'' Standing before a 90-foot white flagpole, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> called it `` one of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s most hallowed shrines.'' He said <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> `` stopped a British invasion and preserved our independence'' in `` one of the greatest chapters in the American experience.'' The speeches in the <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> area kicked off a series of out-of-town appearances to drum up support for the anti-drug strategy. On Friday he heads to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> to deliver the same message. Although the drug plan does n't call for direct use of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops, it proposes sending some drug offenders to military-style boot camps. In addition, the administration is seriously considering using <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> forces for marijuana eradication, said drug policy director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, in a series of appearances Wednesday in behalf of his program, struck back at Democrats who attacked his program. While apologizing for getting `` down into the trenches of domestic politics,'' he told an audience that included a group of Latin American ambassadors: `` I could n't help but notice that the minute I finished speaking, there was the predictable response by some that we have n't done enough.'' On <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, some Democrats pushed the case for raising taxes to finance an all-out fight against narcotics with Rep. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ill </LOCATION>., declaring: `` Unless the president supports the tax increases that will be necessary to fight this war, the drug dealers are going to win. House Speaker <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, D-Wash., said that `` without the administration's support, the idea of raising taxes is futile. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has rejected new taxes.

<HEAD>British Hooligans Hustled Out of Sweden</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: New thruout to UPDATE with Thatcher quote, ferry refusing passage

 Swedish police hustled hundreds of English soccer hooligans out of the country today after they ransacked shops and scuffled with rowdy Swedish youths. Police said 102 Britons and 106 Swedes were arrested before and after Wednesday's World Cup qualifying match, which ended in a 0-0 draw. Duty officer <PERSON> Lennart </PERSON> <PERSON> Norden </PERSON> said 78 people spent the night in jail. Newspapers ran a picture of two youths, one with a raised club in his hand, kicking a man outside a <LOCATION> Stockholm </LOCATION> train station. Dozens of people looked on. A few Britons and Swedes may be charged with assault and vandalism, but nearly all the foreigners have been freed and given 48 hours to leave <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, said Superintendent <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Nilsson </PERSON>. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> called the fans' behavior `` a disgrace to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>,'' and her government asked soccer officials to cancel a visit by the national team to the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> in December `` I am always horrified if there is any difficulty with football fans abroad,'' she said. Scandinavian Seaways said today it refused passage to about 20 Britons, fearing violence. It bought back return tickets from one group and volunteered to pay for 10 people to find another way home. `` We did n't want them on board,'' said a spokesman. The shipping line said it confiscated passports of another 30 passengers, and threatened to turn over the documents to British police if there was any problem at sea. About 600 policemen at the <LOCATION> Rasunda </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Stadium </LOCATION> in suburban <LOCATION> Stockholm </LOCATION> kept the <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> fans isolated in a standing terrace during the game. Dozens of visitors were escorted directly from the stadium to trains for the west coast ports of <LOCATION> Goteborg </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Helsingborg </LOCATION> for the return ferry to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. Swedes and Britons clashed later in town, but no serious injuries were reported. The trouble `` was less than we expected,'' said police Superintendent <PERSON> Sture </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoglund </PERSON>. One newspaper headline read: `` Police Win the Match.'' Earlier, about 100 <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> supporters, mostly teen-agers, rampaged through downtown <LOCATION> Stockholm </LOCATION>, throwing bottles at police vehicles, knocking down passers-by and vandalizing shops. One large group of youngsters entered the Ahlens department store, overturning flower pots and goods displays. Some looting also was reported, <PERSON> Norden </PERSON> said. `` No more,'' wrote sports commentator <PERSON> Stefan </PERSON> <PERSON> Thylin </PERSON> in the Aftonbladet daily. `` This problem seems insoluble. <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> must be shut out of the European soccer community.'' The hooliganism could effect a decision by the European soccer clubs' governing body, <ORGANIZATION> UEFA </ORGANIZATION>, to lift a ban against English clubs playing in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The ban was imposed after <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> supporters were blamed for a riot that triggered a stampede in <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, killing 39 spectators. The ban does not apply to the national team. On Monday a British fan died when he jumped off a ferry into the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>. Under the influence of drugs, he panicked when companions sprayed him with a fire extinguisher. Fears of hooliganism prompted the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Football </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> to ask its Swedish counterpart to cut back ticket sales in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. About 1,000 visitors attended the match at <LOCATION> Rasunda </LOCATION>, which was filled to its 38,500-seat capacity.

 <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> pledged today to put President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s anti-drug legislation `` on a fast track,'' while another senior Democrat clashed with <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> over the administration's refusal to ban U.S.-made assault rifles. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, the point man in the administration's war on drugs, told Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> in a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> hearing there were constitutional problems with a rifle-ban proposal. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>'s appearance was his first of two during the day as <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> began its review of the $ 7.9 billion drug package <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> outlined in a nationally televised speech Tuesday night. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wants a crackdown on casual users of drugs and more money for treatment facilities, as well as more prison cells to house criminals and stepped-up efforts against South American drug lords. A number of congressional Democrats have said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> should recommend a tax increase to pay for the plan instead of proposing to take money from other programs. The $ 7.9 billion sought is $ 2.2 billion above the 1989 budget authorization. <PERSON> Biden </PERSON>, D-Del., told <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> he hoped consultations could begin as soon as possible with congressional leaders over the drug legislation No formal bills have been introduced yet, although they are expected to be over the next several days. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said the arsenals kept by Colombian drug lords have been heavily stocked with American-made guns. `` The <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people want action'' to outlaw `` the weapons of choice of these thugs and mobsters on the streets,'' he said. `` Are we going to get action out of the administration?'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., asked the drug policy coordinator `` I think there are very serious constitutional problems,'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> responded. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration already has banned the import of a number of foreign-made assault rifles but has balked at shutting off <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> manufacturing amid a heavy lobbying campaign from the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rifle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. The president's anti-drug strategy itself brought surprisingly little fireworks at the hearing, although Democrats have complained over the last several days that the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration's plans for financing it were insufficient. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> told a packed <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> audience Wednesday that <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> revealed `` no substantive disagreements with the strategy'' in his <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> response to the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> plan aired Tuesday night. <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> said the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> plan is n't `` bold enough, but it's a good start.'' As for those who say the $ 7.9 billion is inadequate to fight the war on drugs, <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said, `` I'm just not going to be all that receptive to criticism of the figure of $ 8 billion from people whose correct mark is $ 6 billion.'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said the strategy, if pursued `` consistently over time,'' will enable the country to win the war against drugs, but he cautioned that it wo n't happen quickly with any `` Batman through the transom'' flashy solutions. The strategy, which <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> had directed <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> to develop, calls for a law enforcement crackdown on all levels of drug trafficking, from drug kingpins overseas to casual users in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. It seeks a 53 percent increase in funding for treatment programs, a 25 percent increase in prevention efforts, and a vast expansion of the federal prison system to house drug offenders. The strategy also calls for $ 261 million next year in military and law enforcement aid to <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>, the three main cocaine-producing countries. The administration plans to offer those countries some $ 2 billion more over the next five years once they demonstrate solid efforts to cut down on drug trafficking. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Wednesday visited the <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>'s pediatrics ward and cradled one of about a dozen infants who were abandoned after birth by mothers addicted to drugs. The babies, after being cured of their own drug dependencies, still must wait for months until foster care can be found for them. Sen. <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Alaska </LOCATION>, temporarily halted a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> effort to bolster treatment programs by cutting funds for congressional mailings. The measure, proposed by Republicans and accepted by Democrats, would reduce the $ 80 million proposed for next year's congressional mail, transferring $ 45 million of it to a treatment program for pregnant women addicted to crack cocaine and other drugs A vote was blocked by <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Alaska </LOCATION>, who argued that such a cut would deprive Alaskans of an important source of news. The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> said the drug strategy will compromise civil liberties and will be `` counterproductive and cynical,'' shortchanging prevention and treatment programs while putting `` overwhelming reliance on the criminal justice system.'' <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Fiedler </PERSON>, national director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reform </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marijuana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laws </ORGANIZATION>, said the program declares `` war on at least 25 million fellow citizens who are leading productive lives but for their casual or regular use of marijuana.'' Also, the <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> said drug agents have detected a sharp increase in cocaine prices in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> over the past few weeks, but are not yet ready to say whether the <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> government's crackdown on traffickers has disrupted the business. The retail price of cocaine in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> has gone from an average of $ 11,000 to $ 16,000 per kilogram to about $ 20,000, based on sales of 5 to 15 kilograms, <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Shults </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Khomeini's Son Rules Out Relations with United States</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The son of the late <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> today ruled out relations between <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s new president, <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, is undoubtedly anti-American. <PERSON> Ahmad </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>, 43, appeared to be trying to rally radicals against conciliatory moves toward the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> expected from <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, who is associated with the so-called pragmatist camp in postwar <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. Hatred of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, referred to in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> as the `` Great Satan,'' is strong among radicals who favor maintaining revolutionary Islamic fervor. <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> radio, monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, quoted <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> as saying: `` You know well the higher authorities of the country and our dear president. If our president is not anti-American, who in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> is?'' He spoke at a meeting with families of soldiers who died in the eight-year <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> war. <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> added that <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> `` is not a person to take even one step outside the path of the imam, and against his guidance,'' the radio reported. Iranians regarded <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> as a supreme spiritual leader, or imam. Before his death on June 3, he preached a staunchly anti-American doctrine that ruled out any ties with <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. His son's description of <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>'s anti-American credentials would seem to make any friendly gesture toward the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> more difficult. <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, elected July 28, is known to want to shed <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s radical image abroad, to end <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>'s international isolation, and to attract foreign investment and technology to rebuild the country's war-battered economy <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> recently won parliamentary approval for a 22-man Cabinet consisting largely of technocrats, many Western-educated, and his administration is making positive gestures to ease strains with some foes. Earlier this week, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s deputy foreign minister, <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Besharati </PERSON>, said 16 Western hostages, including eight Americans, being held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> by pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem groups could be freed if <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> releases billions of dollars in frozen Iranian assets. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> has made the release of the hostages a condition for improving ties with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. The younger <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> used to act as a spokesman for his father and was expected to become part of the senior leadership when his father died. But he has no official role and is considered more of a symbol for the hard-line elements with which he has allied himself.

 Investigators are trying to determine whether the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> State Fair's grand champion steer, <PERSON> Hank </PERSON>, also goes by the name <PERSON> Carl </PERSON>, a ribbon winner at an <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> farm show. The key piece of evidence is a patch of white hair on <PERSON> Hank </PERSON>'s underside that had been dyed black, an <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> state fair official said Coloring the animal's hide is itself a violation, but fair officials are also investigating whether <PERSON> Hank </PERSON> was shown as <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> three weeks earlier at the <LOCATION> Iroquois </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fair </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, where it won a second-place ribbon. If the allegation is true, the prize steer violates the rules of both fairs because it was shown by different families and because it fails to meet ownership requirements. An exhibitor must own and care for the animal as of Jan. 1 to show at either fair. The <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> 4-H, the Future Farmers of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and the state fair have been gathering evidence for more than two weeks. When officials examined the <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> fair's grand champion steer after the competition Aug. 14, a dark dye was wiped from the steer's abdomen The dark-colored hairs have grown out. `` It is white,'' <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Goard </PERSON>, director of livestock and agriculture for the state fair, said Wednesday. `` It needs to match the spots on pictures of the animal from <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, but it appears to be white, and coloring an animal is a major violation in itself.'' A white spot was visible in photos of <PERSON> Carl </PERSON>, shown by <PERSON> Jeremy </PERSON> <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>, 12, at the Iroquois County Fair on July 24. <PERSON> Hank </PERSON> was shown by <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Shealy </PERSON>, 17, of <LOCATION> Tiro </LOCATION>, who could be forced to forfeit her first-place ribbon and the $ 28,000 price the Angus-cross steer brought at the fair. Her family could be banned from showing at the fair for three or more years. <PERSON> Jeremy </PERSON>, of <PERSON> Donovan </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, also could face a penalty. Both families deny any wrongdoing. <PERSON> Hank </PERSON> has been in the custody of <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> while his hair grows out. Investigators visited <ORGANIZATION> OSU </ORGANIZATION>'s beef barn Tuesday to photograph the steer in postures similar to the stances shown in photos of the <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> winner. <PERSON> Jeremy </PERSON>'s father, <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Kopsell </PERSON>, has said <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> was destroyed after eating tainted corn. State fair rules require investigators to make a recommendation to the fair's Beef, Sheep and <ORGANIZATION> Swine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. The committee must recommend action to the nine-member <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Expositions </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, which runs the fair. `` If they call for a hearing, all parties will be notified and given a chance to tell their side of the story,'' <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Foust </PERSON>, general manager of the fair.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Morton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> H. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Meyerson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Symphony </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> is I.M. <PERSON> Pei </PERSON>'s first concert hall _ a once-in-a-century opportunity, and the world famous architect knows he may never have a chance to do it again. `` There are n't that many concert halls built in this world,'' the 72-year-old designer said. But would he do another? `` I tell you, you know, never say never, ` No, I do n't know,' but I do n't think I would be seeking it as much as I once would, because I have done it.'' <PERSON> Pei </PERSON>, whose buildings include the <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> F. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kennedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Library </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gallery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION> and the new <LOCATION> Louvre </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, speaks lovingly of the new <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> symphony hall and the opportunity it presented to him. `` I would have to say that this is one of the great buildings that I have had the fortune'' to design, he said. He received a $ 10 million commission for the <ORGANIZATION> Meyerson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in 1982. <PERSON> Pei </PERSON> likes the feel of the 2,065-seat music chamber. It is more vertical than horizontal, and he says it lends intimacy to the room. The public areas outside the music chamber presented the greatest design challenge for <PERSON> Pei </PERSON>. The lobby area curves around the music chamber in a series of pieces of circles, overlooked by glass that curves and sweeps the area. `` I have n't done a work that has had such a complex geometry,'' he said. <PERSON> Ieoh </PERSON> <PERSON> Ming </PERSON> <PERSON> Pei </PERSON> was born in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. His creations fuse environment with structure. He attributes his rise in architectural circles to his first big break in 1969 _ the commission for the Kennedy Library. <PERSON> Pei </PERSON> was not well-known at the time, and the decision to bypass other masters for him was so surprising that <PERSON> Jacqueline </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> <PERSON> Onassis </PERSON> felt it necessary to explain the decision. From there, he received commissions for the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hancock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tower </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, and the East Building of the National Gallery of Art in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>.

<DATELINE>ATHENS, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A prosecutor concerned about motorcycle riders doing wheelies through city streets has ordered police to confiscate motorcycles of riders arrested for dangerous driving, newspapers reported Thursday. The motorcycles will be regarded as `` instruments used in the committing of a crime,'' prosecutor <PERSON> Christos </PERSON> <PERSON> Dakouris </PERSON> was quoted as saying. A court will decide whether to return the vehicles or keep them. In a bid to cut down on noise pollution in 1985, traffic police began to confiscate noisy motorcycles. Irate riders alleged some officers confiscated parked bikes on suspicion that if they were on the road, they would have been noisy. The latest moves have already drawn fire from the nation's estimated 196,674 motorcyclists `` These decisions are absurd,'' <PERSON> Yannis </PERSON> <PERSON> Efraimidis </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Greek </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motorcycle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, told the <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> daily Proti. Six-time Greek motorcycle champion <PERSON> Dimitris </PERSON> <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> questioned the legality of the decision. A spokesman for the traffic department said officers had not received the prosecutor's order to confiscate motorcycles, but <PERSON> Proti </PERSON> reported that the first victim of the order was arrested Wednesday for racing in the city and that his motorcycle would be held at least until his trial in January.

The indictments came as part of an investigation that resulted in more than 200 arrests in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> in the spring of 1988 in connection with the ring, which smuggled heroin to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in exchange for cocaine. Investigating Magistrate <PERSON> Enzo </PERSON> <PERSON> Macri </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Reggio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Calabria </LOCATION> criminal court, who issued the indictments, said <LOCATION> Reggio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Calabria </LOCATION>, in southern <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, `` represented between 1986 and 1988 the terminal, for departure and arrival, for a colossal exchange of heroin and cocaine between <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' A Mafia-style organization known as the ` ndrangheta operates in the <LOCATION> Reggio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Calabria </LOCATION> area, and its members were believed to have run the drug operation <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> officials announced the breakup of the ring in April 1988.

Authorities said <PERSON> Zorza </PERSON> and another man headed a company that sold artwork and archaeological pieces. The profits were allegedly used to buy drugs, <ORGANIZATION> ANSA </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Zorza </PERSON>, 48, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizen, was arrested in <LOCATION> Bologna </LOCATION> in April 1988 and is also wanted by federal authorities in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> on drug charges.

 A British investigation of <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>'s World War II actions contradicts Deputy Prime Minister <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Howe </PERSON>'s finding that the Austrian president's military unit did not torture <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> commandos, a Jewish organization said Thursday <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> in 1986, when he was foreign secretary, that four British commandos captured in Nazi-occupied <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> were held by the <LOCATION> German </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gestapo </LOCATION> secret police rather than by <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>'s Wehrmacht, or armed forces, unit The new British <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> report ordered by Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> includes German war records which show the commandos were transferred to <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>'s unit in the Greek town of <LOCATION> Salonika </LOCATION>, said the World Jewish <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said only that it will release its report on the investigation in a few weeks. The <ORGANIZATION> WJC </ORGANIZATION>, which was instrumental in the 1986 campaign to expose <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>'s past as a Nazi officer, said it had been informed about the contents of the British report and supplied some of the documents on which the report is based. Records show <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>'s duties as an intelligence officer included prisoner interrogation, the <ORGANIZATION> WJC </ORGANIZATION> said. In written testimony to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> contended there were no interrogations at his unit's headquarters. Nevertheless, in 1987 the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> placed <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> on a list of people barred from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> after finding he participated in the execution of hostages and mistreatment of Allied prisoners. <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> wrote British Member of Parliament <PERSON> Greville </PERSON> <PERSON> Janner </PERSON> in 1986 that his own investigation had determined the four commandos were held in a Gestapo jail. But the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> study says there was no Gestapo jail in <LOCATION> Salonika </LOCATION> and the men were not interrogated by the Gestapo, the <ORGANIZATION> WJC </ORGANIZATION> said. According to the report, the British prisoners `` suffered ill treatment'' at the hands of Wermacht personnel working at the detention center, the <ORGANIZATION> WJC </ORGANIZATION> said.

 The normal random rotation of judges was bypassed and a black judge assigned to the case of a black man slain Aug. 23 by a gang of whites in <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Bensonhurst </LOCATION> section, a court spokeswoman said today. Justice <PERSON> Thaddeus </PERSON> <PERSON> Owens </PERSON>, 70, will take over the murder case on Sept. 18, spokeswoman <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Bourbon </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Owens </PERSON>, an <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> native who has said an uncle was the victim of a lynch mob, is one of three blacks among the 42 state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> justices in <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>, which first reported the story today, said court officials bypassed normal procedures _ in which judges are randomly picked from a list _ to get an experienced and able judge for what will be a difficult trial. Seven whites have been arrested in the attack on 16-year-old <PERSON> Yusuf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON>. Police said he was ambushed and shot by a gang of about 30 whites, many of them carrying baseball bats and clubs. The Post quoted <PERSON> Sol </PERSON> <PERSON> Wachtler </PERSON>, chief judge of the <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>, as saying, `` Neither race nor gender was a factor in this decision. Excellence was the sole criterion used in this case.'' <PERSON> Wachtler </PERSON> oversees administration of the court. `` As far as I'm concerned, I appointed a capable and experienced judge and not a black judge to handle this case,'' <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> <PERSON> Crosson </PERSON>, a deputy chief court administrator, told the newspaper. `` The judge who I designated happens to be black and the fact that he is black will not affect the case.'' On Wednesdsay, 18-year-old <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Fama </PERSON>, the alleged gunman, was indicted on murder charges, as were two other young men earlier. The grand jury found <PERSON> Fama </PERSON> `` shot four times at close range and struck <PERSON> Yusuf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON> twice in the chest,'' said Assistant District Attorney <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> McIntyre </PERSON>. Police said <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON> and three friends were attacked after entering the mostly white neighborhood to buy a used car. Chief of Detectives <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Colangelo </PERSON> said more arrests are likely.

 The government offered a $ 250,000 reward for the capture of two cocaine barons, and said today it would appoint a military mayor in a town infested with death squads employed by drug traffickers. Meanwhile, a reputed money launderer for the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cocaine cartel arrived in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the first person extradited from <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> during the recent crackdown on drug traffickers. Two men on a motorcycle tossed a bomb made of dynamite at the <ORGANIZATION> Banco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hipotecario </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>, the cocaine center of the nation, said a <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> police official who identified himself only as <PERSON> Cardona </PERSON>, his last name. The blast Wednesday night caused $ 45,000 in damage and came just a few hours after authorities defied drug traffickers' threats and carried out the extradition. The government said Wednesday night that President <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> would use his state of siege powers to name military mayors of violence-plagued cities. Today, <PERSON> Alvaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>, spokesman for the governor's office of <LOCATION> Boyaca </LOCATION> state, said Mayor <PERSON> Marino </PERSON> <PERSON> Estrada </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Boyaca </LOCATION>, 95 miles north of <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>, would be summarily replaced by a military officer, <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> Maj. <PERSON> Alvaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Matallana </PERSON>. <PERSON> Estrada </PERSON> was elected in March. <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Boyaca </LOCATION> has been a stronghold of right-wing death squads that the government says are controlled by <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s notorious cocaine cartels, and it is in a region that is believed to be rife with cocaine-processing laboratories. In 1988, a judge order the arrest of <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubio </PERSON>, a former mayor of the town, on allegations of links to drug traffickers. <PERSON> Rubio </PERSON> fled. The opposition <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> issued a communique declaring hat Barco's decision to impose military rule on some towns was unconstitutional. Barco's <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> has supported him in previous instances when he has named military governors in areas where leftist guerrilla violence has been prevalent. The decree is the latest in the extraordinary measures <ORGANIZATION> Barco </ORGANIZATION> has taken to quell violence by drug traffickers. <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> <PERSON> Romero </PERSON>, who was flown out on Wednesday, is the first drug figure extradited to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> under the special emergency powers decreed last month by <PERSON> Barco </PERSON>. He arrived in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> today under heavy guard and was being held at a federal courthouse pending a hearing. <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, 35, is charged in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> in connection with the laundering of $ 1.2 billion worth of illicit cocaine cash. High-ranking <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomats and drug enforcement officials in <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> have said that once extraditions start, they expect drug-related terrorism and violence in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> to worsen. <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s drug lords have said they would rather die in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> than suffer `` life in death' in a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> prison. The traffickers threatened last month to kill 10 judges for every extradited drug suspect. For years, the traffickers had largely succeeded in evading justice through bribery and intimidation. They have had politicians, police, judges and journalists killed and reportedly purchased influence in high places. In 1987, the <ORGANIZATION> Colombian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> threw out an extradition agreement with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The last Colombian drug trafficker to be extradited, the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cartel's <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON>, was sent to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> early that year. He is serving a life sentence in a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> prison. The extradition agreement was revived by <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> last month when he invoked emergency powers after the assassination of Sen. <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Galan </PERSON>, the leading presidential candidate and an outspoken foe of the drug lords. <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> pledged a relentless campaign against drug traffickers and police say the government has since virtually paralyzed cocaine production, raiding labs and sending drug bosses into hiding. The drug lords have declared `` total and absolute war'' on Barco and practically the whole <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> establishment and, in retaliation, drug gangs have bombed factories, newspapers, restaurants and government installations. The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday that in 2,042 raids conducted against suspected drug traffickers under emergency legislation, anti-narcotics squads confiscated 1,190 weapons, more than 20,000 rounds of ammunition, 499 cars and other vehicles, 48 boats and 358 airplanes and helicopters. On Wednesday, the government announced a $ 250,000 reward for information leading to the arrest of either of the two men it calls olombia's top cocaine barons, <PERSON> Pablo </PERSON> <PERSON> Escobar </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gonzalo </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> <PERSON> Gacha </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, showing `` wanted'' posters on television, announced a cash reward for information leading to the arrest of either <PERSON> Escobar </PERSON> or <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> <PERSON> Gacha </PERSON>. Both are wanted by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and both are in hiding. All tips will be `` absolutely confidential'' and all calls will be toll-free, the government announcement said. Fortune magazine has estimated <PERSON> Escobar </PERSON>'s net worth at $ 3 billion. The National Security Council the day before issued a ban on public demonstrations in <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>, the capital and largest city with 6 million people. Colombian impresarios reported a rash of cancellations, due to the unstable situation here, by foreign artists and entertainers who had scheduled Colombian appearances. In a statement on Wednesday, <ORGANIZATION> Barco </ORGANIZATION> called President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s support for <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s war on drugs `` a very favorable start'' but said the key to the battle is to stop drug use in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> called the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> `` one of the countries that has the greatest number of drug addicts.'' He was responding directly to the $ 7.9 billion drug initiative <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> announced Tuesday night, which pledged financial and even military support to this violence-plagued republic that produces 80 percent of the cocaine consumed in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.

 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the world's industrial democracies should send economic, business and labor experts to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> to help that nation's new non-communist government establish a free economy, Sen. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Domenici </PERSON> said Thursday. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mexico </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> explained his proposal as other lawmakers urged the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration to expand the modest package of aid it has earmarked for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> as a critical signal of political support. <PERSON> Domenici </PERSON> said the team of experts he envisions would make a complete but speedy survey of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s largely state-controlled economy and recommend basic changes needed to spur investment and free enterprise. Senate Republican Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> said many of the Polish leaders he spoke with when he visited <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> last month asked for just such help. `` <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s leaders, including its communist leaders, are wide open to new American investment,'' said <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration is considering ways to expand the $ 100 million aid package the president announced in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> earlier this summer. `` I am convinced we can take some additional steps at no cost and perhaps also find some additional resources within existing budgets and programs,'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said. He said although <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> needs long-term help, especially to ease the strain caused by payments on its $ 39 billion foreign debt, short-term aid is essential. `` There can not be a long-term approach unless <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s government makes it through the short term,'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said. `` That's where an immediate American signal of support can be critical.'' `` We in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and our allies in <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, have a big security, political and economic stake in what happens in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said. `` If Solidarity remains in power and succeeds in governing, the threat of war in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> will go down, democratization in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, elsewhere in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and even in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> itself will get a big boost, and the prospects for expanded private investment in and trade with <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> will grow,'' he said. Meanwhile, Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, D-Ill., urged support for his three-step plan to send <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> assistance to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> introduced legislation Wednesday which would postpone interest payments on <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s $ 2.8 billion debt to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> banks for three years and defer half of the interest payments due in the following two years. The proposal also calls for establishment of an investment fund to distribute $ 300 million for development projects in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> for each of three years. It would also call for spending $ 25 million to help <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> modernize its telephone system.

 Acting President F.W. de Klerk today said the results of national elections show that most white voters support his plan to grant some political rights to blacks, despite his party's worst showing in 41 years. Black activists said at least 25 people were killed in clashes with police during protests of the elections Wednesday, from which blacks were excluded. The governing <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> narrowly retained its parliamentary majority in the balloting, losing nearly a quarter of its seats in the dominant white chamber t anti-apartheid and hard-line segregationist parties. With votes counted in all of 166 election districts, it appeared the Nationalists would retain at least 93 of their previous 123 seats in Parliament. The Conservatives, who want stricter enforcement of segregation laws and oppose any political rights for blacks, improved from 22 to 39 seats. The <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which seeks an end to apartheid laws but wants some guarantees that whites and other minorities would retain a voice in the government, went from 20 seats to 33 seats. The jump was the biggest ever for an anti-apartheid faction. In one rural district, officials announced another election would be held to settle a tie between Conservative and <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> candidates. Protesting their disenfranchisement, blacks on Wednesday observed a nationwide general strike that anti-apartheid leaders called the biggest anti-government protest ever with 3 million people taking part. Violence flared in many black and mixed-race areas around <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> and white riot police were seen marching through townships firing in all directions. <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> attorney <PERSON> Essa </PERSON> <PERSON> Moosa </PERSON> said 25 black and mixed-race people had been killed in violence in seven townships. Police said 12 deaths occurred in the <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> area: seven during violence associated with a feud between factions in the black township of <LOCATION> Khayelitsha </LOCATION>, and five during mob violence of unknown origin in three mixed-race townships. Police said four police officers were slightly injured and that more than 50 people were arrested. `` Mr. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON>'s president's seat sits now in a pool of blood,'' said Rev. <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesak </PERSON>, a mixed-race anti-apartheid activist in <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>. `` People who begin a new term of office with a massacre of ... people have no right to be in government.'' <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Naidoo </PERSON>, general secretary of the 980,000-member <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> African Trade Unions and a leader of the defiance campaign, called the police response to the protests `` brutal'' and said of the government: `` They have to deal with us as human beings and respect our dignity and sense of justice or there will not be any peace in our country.'' <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Mzo </PERSON>, secretary-general of the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla group, praised the huge opposition to the elections and said the group's call for a boycott resulted in low turnout among mix-race and Indian voters. `` Of historic significance for the future of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> is the massive challenge of the oppressed working people who in their millions stayed away from work as a massive protest against the undemocratic nature of the elections,'' he said during news conference today in <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>, where he was attending a summit of non-aligned nations. Hospitals and monitoring groups said more than 100 people were hurt as riot squads used whips, tear gas and shotguns to stop peaceful anti-election rallies and disperse stone-throwing crowds in more than 20 townships. Archbishop <PERSON> Desmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> said he had warned Western nations that there would be `` chaos in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'' and urged them to act against the government. He said de Klerk should condemn the police actions and `` express sorrow and condolences to people who have suffered this bereavement.'' <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON>, who is expected to be chosen by an electoral college next week to serve a five-year term as president, described the election results as `` a clear mandate'' for his party's plans for gradual political reform and said the government now should open negotiations with blacks. `` Seventy percent of the whites voted for parties favoring renewal and reform ... and granting political rights,'' he said today, linking his party with the liberal-minded Democrats. During the campaign, <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> had associated the Nationalists with the right-wing Conservatives, saying that in the 1987 white election 80 percent of voters had shown a preference for those parties' promises to enforce segregation. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON>'s campaign platform called for limited black participation in national politics within five years. However, he rejects a one-person, one-vote system leading to black majority rule and supports maintaining segregated schools and and neighborhoods. `` The implementation of a comprehensive economic action plan together with political development will get our country on the road of prosperity again,'' <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> told a news conference. However, he would not answer a question about how the government would begin negotiations after the tough police action against blacks during five weeks of protests leading up to the election. `` The government handled the defiance campaign with aplomb and in a very reasonable way,'' <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> said. Of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s 37 million people, 5 million are white, 28 million black, about 3 million of mixed race and nearly 1 million of Indian descent. Under apartheid, blacks have no vote in national affairs and maintain separate districts, schools and health services. About 69 percent of the 3,160,667 registered white voters cast ballots in the election and, for the first time since 1953, the Nationalists received less than a majority of the white vote. They won 48.6 percent, to 31.3 percent for the Conservatives and 20 percent for the Democrats. Also at stake were seats in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>'s the mixed-race and Indian chambers, which were established in 1984 and have little power. Anti-apartheid activists also called for a boycott of the non-white elections. Incumbents won most races, but <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> candidates generally fared worse than in the white election of 1987. Two prominent Cabinet members, Foreign Minister <PERSON> Pik </PERSON> <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> and Defense Minister <PERSON> Magnus </PERSON> <PERSON> Malan </PERSON>, were re-elected by margins sharply lower than 1987. The Conservatives lost by only five votes in <LOCATION> Vereeniging </LOCATION>, <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON>'s former district. They failed to win some seats they had targeted and fell far short of the 50 to 60 seats they had expected. But they won their first seats in <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION>, the capital, nd their first seats in <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Province </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Orange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION>. Previously, they held seats only in <LOCATION> Transvaal </LOCATION>, the most populous of the four provinces.

 A huge but weaker Hurricane Gabrielle should skirt <LOCATION> Bermuda </LOCATION> sometime after midnight with high winds and big ocean swells, but the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> will get little more than heavy surf, forecasters said today. Forecasters said it appeared the storm center would pass 200 to 300 miles east of <LOCATION> Bermuda </LOCATION>, far enough away for the island to escape destructive tropical storm-force winds. Swells of more than 20 feet were reported in <LOCATION> Bermuda </LOCATION> this morning. `` They'll get some showers, some winds and definitely some surf problems,'' <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheets </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hurricane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, said Wednesday night. <PERSON> Gabrielle </PERSON>'s top sustained winds dropped from a high of 135 mph to 105 mph as it swirled north on a path far from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, but the storm was so large that swells of five to 13 feet were recorded more than 1,500 miles away, from <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. `` We have a very large wind field around this hurricane,'' Sheets said. Winds 39 mph or higher _ a speed that forecasters define as tropical storm-force _ stretched 250 miles to the west and 300 miles to the east as <PERSON> Gabrielle </PERSON> curved north in the <LOCATION> mid-Atlantic </LOCATION>. At noon EDT, <PERSON> Gabrielle </PERSON>'s center was located near 29.9 degrees north latitude and 60.0 degrees west longitude, or about 320 miles east-southeast of <LOCATION> Bermuda </LOCATION>. It was heading north at 15 mph. <PERSON> Gabrielle </PERSON> is the largest and most powerful hurricane of the season, rating just below last year's Hurricane Gilbert, which ravaged the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> with 155 mph winds. Far to the north of <LOCATION> Gabrielle </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Felix </PERSON> maintained its status as a minimal hurricane, with winds of 75 mph. The storm was drifting slowly out in the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> and was no threat to land, forecasters said. At noon EDT, <PERSON> Felix </PERSON>'s center was near 39.5 degree north latitude and 48.0 degrees west longitude, or about 900 miles west of the <LOCATION> Azores </LOCATION>. It was drifting north at 7 mph. <PERSON> Felix </PERSON> is the sixth and <PERSON> Gabrielle </PERSON> the seventh named storm of the 1989 Atlantic hurricane season. Storms are named when their winds reach 39 mph and are classified as hurricanes when they grow to 74 mph.

 Teachers strikes disrupted classes for more than 160,000 pupils in nine states Thursday, including a <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> dispute the school board labeled the state's first illegal strike in three years. The union representing the 190 teachers in <LOCATION> Bristol </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> R.I. </LOCATION>, called the job action that began Wednesday informational picketing, but `` when school is started and there are no teachers in the classrooms, I call that a strike,'' <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> member <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> <PERSON> Pitman </PERSON>. Thursday was the second day that classes were canceled for the 2,250 students in the district. It was the first walkout in <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, where teachers strikes are illegal, since an eight-day strike in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Greenwich </LOCATION> in 1986. The two sides bargained over pay and other issues until early this morning and planned to go back to the table later in the day. Officials said that the <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> may take legal action if the stoppage continued. Elsewhere, strikes were reported in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state. In <LOCATION> Northampton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, about 15 high school students picketed Wednesday to protest the cancellation of the first day of classes at the Wilson Area School District. The strike there affects 110 teachers and 1,850 students. The largest single district to be struck was <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, with 47,000 students affected in a walkout that began Tuesday. The teachers union said more than three-quarters of the 2,300 people covered by the union, which includes non-teaching professionals such as psychologists and nurses as well as teachers, were taking part in the strike. <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> had nine districts with 1,680 teachers and more than 32,000 students affected by walkouts on Thursday, according to figures supplied by the the <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. One of those districts, <LOCATION> Gibraltar </LOCATION>, had already settled by the start of the school day, but classes were not going to resume until Friday. The state with the second-largest number of school strikes was <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, with five. <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> had two strikes each, while one strike each was reported in <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>.

 Police marched through townships firing shotguns and tear gas to break up rallies by people protesting the segregated national elections, and at least 25 people were killed, activists said today. Media reports and a church monitoring group said at least 100 people were injured in more than 20 townships, and one police officer said other officers caused the unrest by indiscriminately beating and whipping blacks. <PERSON> Essa </PERSON> <PERSON> Moosa </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> law firm, said 25 people died Wednesday night and early today in seven black and mixed-race townships outside the city. More violence broke out this afternoon, with white riot squads firing shot guns and tear gas at crowds of dancing and chanting young people in the <LOCATION> Lavender </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> township near <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>, a journalist on the scene said. There was no word on casualties. `` They -LRB- police -RRB- got out of the van and ran down to the road where the students were coming and started firing. There was a lot of tear gas,'' said the journalist, speaking on condition of anonymity. Anglican Archbishop <PERSON> Desmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> said earlier today that 23 people had been killed during election day violence, adding: `` We expect the numbers of the dead to grow.'' Police Maj. <PERSON> Reg </PERSON> <PERSON> Crewe </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION> said at least seven people `` but certainly not as many as 23'' died in violence in the <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> area Wednesday night. He said the circumstances were being investigated. A later police statement said 12 deaths occurred in the <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> area: seven during violence associated with a feud between factions in the black township of <LOCATION> Khayelitsha </LOCATION>, and five during mob violence of unknown origin in three mixed-race townships. Police said more than 50 people were arrested. The independent South African Press Association described the area outside <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> as `` a war zone ... as residents danced around dozens of burning barricades blocking streets in the area and police fired repeatedly at groups of youths.'' One local newspaper, Grassroots, said it had confirmed 15 bodies were in a local mortuary. Acting President F.W. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON>'s governing <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> narrowly retained its majority in Wednesday's parliamentary elections, which excluded the black majority. An anti-apartheid activist, the Rev. <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesak </PERSON>, said <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON>'s presidency `` now sits in a pool of blood.'' `` People who begin a new term of office with a massacre ... have no right to be in government,'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> has ruled <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> for 41 years. The <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Province </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Churches </ORGANIZATION> said at least 100 people were injured, including children. <ORGANIZATION> Groote </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Schuur </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> said 40 people were admitted Wednesday night with birdshot injuries. <ORGANIZATION> Gatesville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> said it treated at least 20 people hit by birdshot, including a 4-year-old. <LOCATION> Tyberberg </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> reported 20 admissions for ammunition wounds. Police reported 200 instances of unrest nationwide from Wednesday through today, including rock throwing, arson and illegal gatherings, police said. Police said they used shotguns, rubber bullets, whips and tear gas to disperse placard-carrying marchers as well as people throwing stones. In at least two instances, police said they whipped and arrested demonstrators who sat down when they were told to disperse. Police said seven officers around the country, including four near <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>, suffered minor injuries when they were hit by rocks and bottles. On Wednesday, journalists saw five white policemen flanked by a yellow armored vehicle walking through the mixed-race township of <LOCATION> Manenberg </LOCATION> outside <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>. They said the officers slowly raised their shotguns and tear gas rifles and fired straight ahead and down side streets as they marched along. A crowd of mixed-race youths, men and women had set fire to burning barricades of tree branches, newspaper and mattresses at each end of the street. They were dancing and talking in the street, but scattered behind fences and into houses when the armored vehicle rolled over the first barricade. One or two youths threw rocks toward the police, but hit nothing. A mixed-race police lieutenant in the <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>'s Plain area of <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> said Wednesday night that police riot squads were `` the cause of the riots'' in that area on Tuesday. Lt. <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Rockman </PERSON>, 30, said a white riot-squad major threatened to detain him under emergency regulations when he tried to stop officers from hitting bystanders as well as students holding a placard demonstration. `` They just stormed and hit them whenever they felt like doing that _ they hit them like mad,'' <PERSON> Rockman </PERSON> said. He said four officers joined to beat a woman waiting for a bus with whips. `` She was jumping up and down. Then she ran and they chased after her,'' <PERSON> Rockman </PERSON>. `` One of them even fell and then got up again and chased her, hitting her. Their was an elderly man -LRB- who -RRB- collapsed because of the beating.'' As the local crime prevention officer, <PERSON> Rockman </PERSON> said he had tried to defuse trouble by telling the students they could `` do their thing'' and then disperse in 20 minutes. He said he took one riot squad out of view of the students, but that another squad repeatedly charged into `` the normal curious crowds,'' including shoppers. `` They were just hitting people. They could n't care if they were innocent bystanders or not,'' <PERSON> Rockman </PERSON> said. `` They were running after them even when they were fleeing, hitting them. `` It seemed to me that they were enjoying themselves, feasting on the people. ` You could just see the killer instinct in their eyes.'' <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> police Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Phillipus </PERSON> <PERSON> Fourie </PERSON> confirmed that <PERSON> Rockman </PERSON> had been summoned to his office Wednesday to discuss police matters but he would not comment further. <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> said that <PERSON> Rockman </PERSON> could face retaliation, but that he was `` going to be given very wide recognition in the black community'' for his willingness to describe police action.

 <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday began its annual fall maneuvers, which this year involve 205,000 troops in 16 land, air and sea exercises throughout <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s Allied Command <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> said its Autumn Forge maneuvers began with the arrival of a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> C-130 Hercules transport plane from <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Rhein-Main </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Air </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Base </LOCATION> to participate in `` Armada Exchange,'' the first of the fall maneuvers. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Gen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Galvin </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s top military commander in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, said in a statement that military maneuvers remain necessary despite the warming in <LOCATION> East-West </LOCATION> relations in recent years. `` There is probably no need to remind anybody that while we can be hopeful about the success of arms control negotiations, there is still a requirement for national and collective security,'' <PERSON> Galvin </PERSON> said in the statement issued by Allied Command <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> headquarters in southern <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>. `` Our potential adversaries are still quite big and unpredictable.''

 <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> raised nearly $ 17 million in one week during 1986, but its Heritage Grand Hotel was almost constantly short of cash, the jury in <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s fraud trial was told today. The testimony came after a day after the judge pronounced the TV evangelist competent to stand trial. A government psychiatrist had testified that <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> suffered a `` panic attack'' last week but is not going crazy. <PERSON> Delores </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, who worked in <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s cash management office, testified this morning that during the week of May 31, 1986, the ministry collected $ 13,000 from passing the plate at Sunday services and $ 7,000 from the TV audience of `` The Jim and <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON> <PERSON> Show </PERSON>.'' `` It was sometimes more, sometimes less,'' she said when asked whether the $ 20,000 in cash collections for the week were unusual. Ms. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said the rest of the $ 17 million `` would have to be the Lifetime Silver 1000 Account,'' one of several `` lifetime partnership'' programs that offered $ 1,000 contributors three nights' free lodging each year for life. Prosecutors say <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> and other <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> executives diverted to their own use more than $ 4 million of the $ 158 million raised by partnerships from 1984 to 1987. If convicted on all counts, <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> could receive 120 years in prison and more than $ 5 million in fines. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Maybrey </PERSON>, general manager of <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grand </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hotel </ORGANIZATION> in 1984-85, testified today that the management contract with <ORGANIZATION> Brock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hotel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> required that half the 500 rooms be set aside for lifetime partners. <PERSON> Brock </PERSON> employed <PERSON> Maybrey </PERSON> to run the hotel. He said <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> had agreed to keep a $ 300,000 balance in an operating account for the hotel, but he warned <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> in two memos in 1985 that the account was at least $ 195,000 short of the requirement. <PERSON> Brock </PERSON> had to pay employees out of its own funds at one point because of the shortages, <PERSON> Maybrey </PERSON> testified. `` It was difficult to balance the level of services with the cash flow problems we were experiencing,'' said <PERSON> Maybrey </PERSON>. Last week, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Potter </PERSON> committed <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> to a federal prison for psychiatric evaluation after his lawyers reported he was hallucinating and cowering under a couch. After a competency hearing Wednesday out of sight of the jury, <PERSON> Potter </PERSON> released <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>. `` He is not going crazy,'' Dr. <PERSON> Sally </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, head of the psychiatric team at the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correctional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Butner </LOCATION>, told the judge. `` He has no hidden mental illness. The stress that he's feeling is normal.'' Ms. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said she did n't think <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> had faked his breakdown. She said <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> told her that journalists at the courthouse took on the form of frightening animals. In Wednesday's testimony, former fund-raiser <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Price </PERSON> broke into tears when she described trying to discourage an elderly woman from purchasing a $ 1,000 lifetime partnership. She said she was fired for complaining about <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> policy. `` I told her that selling a burial policy to buy a lifetime partnership was not a good idea,'' Ms. Price said Wednesday. Former <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> Vice President <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, whose fainting episode on the stand last week was cited by doctors as triggering <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s breakdown, returned to testify Wednesday <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> said he had gone to <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> and former <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> Vice President <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Dortch </PERSON> with concerns over the number of `` lifetime partnerships'' sold at the 500-room Heritage Grand Hotel. `` I told them we had problems getting people in there,'' he said. `` I told them we could not sell more memberships.'' Ms. Price testified that workers were encouraged to sell as many partnerships as they could, regardless of whether the hotel could accommodate them. Ms. Price, who was in charge of handling partner relations, said she took her concerns to <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> on several occasions. She said that when she and 10 members of her staff were fired in 1985, she asked <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, her boss at the time, why she was let go. `` He leaned back in his chair and said, ` That's the price you pay for knowing too much and not keeping your mouth shut,''' she said, crying. `` Ten people lost their jobs because my conscience would n't let me keep my mouth shut I carry that with me to this day.'' <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>, who said he was suffering from the flu, appeared more alert during Wednesday's testimony. He smiled, chatted with attorneys and reviewed documents. He showed little emotion during the morning competency hearing, sometimes hanging his head and staring at the floor. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>, who resigned from the <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> ministry in 1987 in a sex-and-money scandal, went on trial Aug. 28. Prosecutors contend <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> oversold the partnerships and used nearly $ 4 million in ministry funds to live in high style.

<HEAD>U.S. Fights Oakland Ordinance Barring Nuclear Weapons</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BOB EGELKO</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration is suing to overturn an <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION> ordinance barring `` nuclear weapons work'' in the city. The ordinance _ one of the few such nuclear-free ordinances not considered symbolic among about 160 in the country _ unconstitutionally interferes with national defense, the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said in a lawsuit filed Wednesday in federal court. The ordinance could force two federal installations employing 2,170 people to leave <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION>, the department said. They are the <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supply </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, which supplies <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fleet </ORGANIZATION> ships with components for nuclear weapons, and a <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> operations office overseeing weapons research at the <ORGANIZATION> Lawrence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Livermore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> east of <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION>. But <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Bloom </PERSON>, primary author of the ballot initiative, said the measure approved by voters in November was drafted to exclude the Naval Supply Center, where more than 2,000 people work. And City Attorney <PERSON> Jayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said the ban on nuclear weapons work covered such activities as `` creating nuclear weapons in their offices,'' and should not apply to an administrative office like the DOE's. The lawsuit said the Constitution gives the federal government exclusive authority over defense. The lawsuit also said the Atomic Energy Act gives the federal government sole authority over nuclear weapons and nuclear energy. The ballot initiative's sponsors countered that local communities also have rights. `` We should be able to exercise the full power of local governments to protect our health and safety and to direct policy about what happens in our city jurisdictions,'' said <PERSON> Madge </PERSON> <PERSON> Strong </PERSON> of the Nuclear-Free <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bloom </PERSON> added that the First Amendment should take precedence. `` The people of an entire city are saying, we do n't want this going on. The federal government is saying, you have no right to say that. That ceases to be democracy,'' <PERSON> Bloom </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, the city attorney, called <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION>'s nuclear-free ordinance one of the broadest in the country. Among other things, it bans nuclear weapons work in the city in two years. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said she believed it was the first such ordinance the federal government has challenged. A conservative legal group filed a federal lawsuit challenging it four months ago.

 Someone paid <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' $ 500,000 hospital bill, but his wife said she was unsure exactly how the payment was arranged. <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Tiwanak </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, confirmed Wednesday the bill had been paid in full. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' basic intensive-care needs cost about $ 2,000 a day. The former <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> president has been hospitalized since Jan. 15 for treatment of heart, lung and kidney ailments. He remained in very critical condition Thursday. <PERSON> Imelda </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> said the money might have come from loans from friends and supporters and from assets not frozen by the courts. <PERSON> Tiwanak </PERSON> said the Marcoses at first were not paying their bills and officials approached the family when the bills reached $ 300,000. In March, Mrs. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> asked the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government to cover the hospital costs, saying she and her husband had been brought to this country against their will.

His first year he correctly predicted <PERSON> Cheryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Prewitt </PERSON> would be crowned Miss America 1980. He then named four more winners over the next nine years. But in the past few years, his statistical odds have failed. He gave little hope to the past two winners, saying a Tahitian dancer and a violinist had little chance of capturing the crown. They did, and the dancer _ Miss <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> 1988 <PERSON> Kaye </PERSON> <PERSON> Lani </PERSON> <PERSON> Rae </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafko </PERSON> _ turned out to be <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>'s favorite so far. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> used various statistics to devise his predictions, including height, weight, hair and eye color, academic major and talent. He was forced to stop using bust, waist and hip measurements after the pageant stopped releasing those figures three years ago.

Last year's winner, <PERSON> Gretchen </PERSON> <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON>, attends <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and hopes to go to law school.

<HEAD>Storm Winds, Pilot's Decision to Take Off, Caused Cuban Crash</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MEXICO CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The pilot of a jetliner that crashed in <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION> and killed 170 people took off in severe winds against the control tower's advice, <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> news reports said Thursday. The Soviet-made Cubana de Aviacion jet crashed into a suburb off the end of the runway Sunday. All but one of the 126 people on board died, and 45 people on the ground were killed. Gen. <PERSON> Rogelio </PERSON> <PERSON> Acevedo </PERSON>, head of the Cuban government commission investigating the Sunday crash, said winds up to 30 mph near the end of the <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Marti </PERSON> airport runway in <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION> were believed to be the basic cause of the crash, the <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> government news agency <ORGANIZATION> Prensa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Latina </ORGANIZATION> said. The tower advised the pilot, Capt. <PERSON> Armando </PERSON> <PERSON> Oliveros </PERSON>, to wait before leaving, and the commission thinks his decision to take off was in error, the agency quoted <PERSON> Acevedo </PERSON> as saying. <PERSON> Luigi </PERSON> <PERSON> Capalbo </PERSON>, 22, of <ORGANIZATION> Parma </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, was the only survivor on the Ilyushin 62. Doctors at <LOCATION> Hermanos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ameijeiras </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> were treating him for head injuries, burns over 65 percent of his body and a broken left leg. <PERSON> Acevedo </PERSON>, who is president of the <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, said the pilot, faced with winds of 28 to 30 mph and heavy rain, reduced the angle of the wing flaps apparently to gain speed, but wind drove the plane down. A tail wheel struck the runway and the right wing hit an antenna at the end of the runway. The plane then lifted slightly, clearing a concrete median on a major street, and plunged into homes, he said. Two square blocks were destroyed. No indication was found of mechanical problems on the 7-month-old plane, which had been flown 1,300 hours, he said. <PERSON> Oliveros </PERSON>, 51, had been flying 29 years and instructed other pilots, the news agency said. Builders of the plane arrived early Thursday from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to aid Cuban and Italian teams in the investigation. One of their tasks will be to analyze data on the three flight recorders that were recovered.

<TEXT>
 A state judge today ruled that the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration _ the most powerful opponent to Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>'s plan to tear down the <LOCATION> Shoreham </LOCATION> nuclear plant _ may enter the state court fight against the agreement <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Travers </PERSON> ruled that the federal <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> was an `` interested party'' through its ownership of the <ORGANIZATION> Brookhaven </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> on <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. There was no immediate word from the <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> administration on whether it will appeal. <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> has sought to prevent the $ 5.5 billion plant on <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> from operating because of concern over whether the region can be safely evacuated. Under a deal negotiated by <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> Long </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Island </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lighting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the state will buy the plant for $ 1 and have it dismantled. In return, <ORGANIZATION> LILCO </ORGANIZATION> gets at least a decade's worth of annual rate increases of about 10 percent. Its customers already pay among the highest electric rates in the nation. If the deal goes through, and it has already been approved by the required state agencies and <ORGANIZATION> LILCO </ORGANIZATION> stockholders, it will be the first time a completed nuclear plant was torn down without having gone into commercial operation. In his ruling, <ORGANIZATION> Travers </ORGANIZATION> noted that <ORGANIZATION> Brookhaven </ORGANIZATION> lies on 5,000 acres of federal land and that the DOE intends to purchase 41,000 megawatt hours of electricity from the <ORGANIZATION> Long </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Island </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lighting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> this year at a cost of more than $ 3 million. `` Here, where <PERSON> DOE </PERSON> is a landowner and user of power provided by <ORGANIZATION> LILCO </ORGANIZATION>, the court, in its discretion determines that DOE should be allowed to and is granted permission to intervene,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Travers </ORGANIZATION>. Last week, state lawyers argued that <PERSON> DOE </PERSON> intervention would be `` superfluous'' and that interested parties were all represented in a lawsuit filed against the <ORGANIZATION> Shoreham </ORGANIZATION> deal by the conservative <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>. The lawsuit before Travers argues, among other things, that <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> usurped the power of the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> in negotiating the <LOCATION> Shoreham </LOCATION> deal and that there should have been a state environmental impact statement. Travers has yet to rule on the merits of those arguments.

 <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON>'s family today rejected the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s conclusion that the gunner's mate probably caused the explosion that killed 47 sailors on the USS Iowa by shoving a detonator between gunpowder bags. `` I never believed it right from the start,'' <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kubicina </PERSON>, <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON>'s sister, said outside her father's home following a two-hour briefing by <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officers this morning. `` I did n't really hear anything I did n't hear before.'' The family attorney, <PERSON> Kraig </PERSON> <PERSON> Brusnahan </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON>'s relatives want a congressional investigation into the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> probe of the April 19 blast aboard the battleship and repeated leaks to the news media from investigators. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> is kind of investigating itself and clearing itself,'' said <PERSON> Brusnahan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON>'s father, <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> veteran, also said he did n't believe the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> conclusion. `` I think there was a powder explosion _ accidental _ that caused the explosion,'' <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON> said. The family was briefed at <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON>'s home by a three-officer team led by Capt. <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Katz </PERSON>. `` This is probably one of the hardest things I've ever done in my entire life,'' said <PERSON> Katz </PERSON>, who left the home a half hour before the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> released the report on the April 19 disaster off <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>. The report said the exact cause of the explosion, the worst naval disaster since the Vietnam War, can not be pinpointed since the sailors close enough to see what was going on, including <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON>, were all killed in the fiery blast. However, Rear Adm. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Milligan </PERSON>, presenting the conclusions in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said there was much `` circumstantial information'' pointing to <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON>.

 A reputed money-launderer for the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cocaine cartel arrived in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> under heavy guard today at a tiny suburban airport, the first person extradited from <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> in its recent drug crackdown. <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> <PERSON> Romero </PERSON>, who is accused of helping the drug cartel launder at least $ 15 million, later appeared with a lawyer at a preliminary federal court hearing, telling Magistrate <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Feldman </PERSON> through an interpreter that he speaks only Spanish and does not fully understand the charges against him. <PERSON> Feldman </PERSON> postponed arraignment until Monday and ordered <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> held without bail until then. Prosecutors said they would ask that he be denied bail then. They would not say disclose where <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> was being held. <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> left <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> aboard a <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> plane on Wednesday night, federal officials said. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Barr </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> said the plane landed under tight security just outside <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> today at <LOCATION> Charlie </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brown </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, a small, county-run airport used by private planes. <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> was whisked away in a helicopter. He appeared in court without handcuffs or leg irons. Additional officers were in the courtroom and security appeared higher, but not extraordinarily so. Federal agents were `` on an increased state of alert'' for any retaliation from the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cartel, said <PERSON> Weldon </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, agent in charge of the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. `` We're very concerned because of the events transpiring and because of the violence that has occurred in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said. He said some cartel members reportedly have said `` there might be ... some violent act attempted in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> because of the extradition.'' <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> was arrested the first weekend after Colombian President <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> launched a crackdown on drug traffickers triggered by the Aug. 18 assassination of leading presidential candidate <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Galan </PERSON>, an outspoken foe of the drug trade. The <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> newspaper <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tiempo </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> after his arrest as saying he was innocent. `` At no time have I had links to the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cartel and I do n't know any of its members,'' he said In the emergency measures imposed by <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> was a reinstitution of the extradition agreement with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> that had been thrown out by the <ORGANIZATION> Colombian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in 1987. Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said in a statement late Wednesday, `` I applaud the extraordinary courage and resolve of President <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> and the government of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> in their efforts to restore the rule of law to <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, 36, was indicted in March in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> as a result of an investigation code-named Operation Polar Cap that federal officials said revealed an operation that laundered billions of dollars in cocaine profits through <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and foreign banks. Charges were brought against 127 people and two <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> banks as a result of that investigation. Drug traffickers in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, who supply an estimated 80 percent of the cocaine consumed in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, are said to fear extradition to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> because they believe they will not be able to escape conviction and prison sentences. In response to <ORGANIZATION> Barco </ORGANIZATION>'s crackdown, the traffickers declared `` total war'' on the government and have carried out bombings and shootings in <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>, home of the world's largest drug cartel and the second largest city in the country, and in <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>, the largest and the capital. The last trafficker to be extradited was <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON>, a leader of the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cartel who was sent to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1987 and is serving a life sentence in the federal prison in <LOCATION> Marion </LOCATION>, Ill. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government responded to the outbreak of violence in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> by sending $ 65 million equipment and other aid _ airplanes, helicopters and vehicles _ as well as military advisers to the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> country. In addition, plans were accelerated to send some $ 2.5 million worth of help to protect Colombian judges, dozens of whom have been killed by drug gangs. In his national drug control strategy announced Tuesday night, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said military and law enforcement aid to <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> would increase from an estimated $ 53 million this year to $ 261 million next year. The administration also promised an additional $ 2 billion over the next five years to the three countries if they demonstrated their commitment to cracking down on drugs. Meanwhile, the <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday that drug agents have detected a sharp increase in cocaine prices in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> over the past few weeks but they're not ready to say whether it is due to the crackdown on traffickers. The retail price of cocaine in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> has gone from an average of $ 11,000 to $ 16,000 per kilogram to about $ 20,000, based on sales of 5 to 15 kilograms, said <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Shults </PERSON>. Whether <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s crackdown on traffickers is actually stemming the flow of drugs into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the price increase probably has been enhanced by that effort, <PERSON> Shults </PERSON> said. `` It may just be individual entrepreneurs capitalizing on perceived market pressures,'' he said.

<TEXT>
 Rep. <PERSON> Barney </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> said Thursday he used his congressional immunity to void parking tickets incurred by a personal aide who was also a male prostitute, but only when the assistant had used <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>'s car for official business. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, D-Mass., said he allowed the aide, <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gobie </PERSON>, to use his car for official business and also gave him authorization to drive it when the congressman was out of town The lawmaker had said earlier that he hired <PERSON> Gobie </PERSON> in July 1985 as his housekeeper and driver, paying him from personal funds, and fired him in August 1987. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, an acknowledged homosexual who has asked that his situation with <PERSON> Gobie </PERSON> be investigated by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics committee, issued a statement on the parking tickets after a story on the subject appeared in Thursday's <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Times. `` Part of Mr. <PERSON> Gobie </PERSON>'s uties was the use of my car on official business and access to my car when I was away from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>'s statement said. `` There are some occasions when tickets were issued even though the car was being used on official business.

He previously said he operated an escort service from <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> apartment. `` He knew what I was doing,'' said <PERSON> Gobie </PERSON>. `` I used to drive that car around all the time.'' <PERSON> Gobie </PERSON> told the Times he always left <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>'s official congressional plate on the dashboard when he used the car. He said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>'s car was ticketed about 50 times over a year-and-a-half. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> has said he paid <PERSON> Gobie </PERSON> $ 80 for sex after answering a classified ad in a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> gay newspaper in the spring of 1985. The representative said he then hired <PERSON> Gobie </PERSON> as his housekeeper and driver, hoping to change his ways, but fired him when he found out <PERSON> Gobie </PERSON> was using <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>'s apartment to operate a prostitution ring. In Thursday's statement, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> said, `` These and all other issues are rightfully before the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics committee at my request and will be dealt with in detail.''

For the defection, <LOCATION> Taiwain </LOCATION> will pay him 206 pounds of gold worth about $ 880,000. <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> has a sliding scale of gold rewards for <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> military defectors, calculated on the type of aircraft they bring out. <PERSON> Chiang </PERSON> flew his Soviet-built fighter to the Nationalist-held island of <LOCATION> Quemoy </LOCATION> on Wednesday from <LOCATION> Longxi </LOCATION> airport in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s southern <LOCATION> Fujian </LOCATION> province, just over a mile away The flight took 14 minutes. He was brought to <LOCATION> Taipei </LOCATION> on Thursday for a news conference and told reporters he had planned to defect for two years but was spurred to action by the June crackdown on the student-led democracy movement at Tiananmen Square in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. After taking off, <PERSON> Chiang </PERSON> said he kept the fighter low to escape pursuing aircraft, but the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> air force apparently did not notice he had left. `` I was so nervous that I did n't know if anyone followed me,'' he said. `` I could still hear the air base's communications when I landed at <LOCATION> Quemoy </LOCATION> airport.'' <PERSON> Chiang </PERSON> said he left his parents, a sister, and his grandmother behind. In <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Zhaoxing </PERSON> said `` the press reports about the plane are under investigation by the departments concerned.'' <PERSON> Chiang </PERSON> defended the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> military, which fired on thousands of residents in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> on June 3-4. `` The military stood beside the people and supported the pro-democracy movement, but they had to carry out orders from authorities,'' he said. `` They executed orders against their own will. I sympathize with the soldiers. They were but the tools to execute the orders of the <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>.'' <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> says about 300 people died in the street clashes, including unspecified `` dozens'' of security personnel and more than 200 civilians. Western security sources say the death toll may have been 3,000. Four women from the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> draped a banner outside the conference room protesting <PERSON> Chiang </PERSON>'s entry to <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> They said the government should not welcome communists while barring many Taiwanese political dissidents from returning home. The last Chinese pilot to defect to <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Liu </PERSON> <PERSON> Chih-yuan </PERSON>, 30, also flew a MiG-19 when he fled in 1987. The Nationalist government rewarded him with 412 pounds of gold then valued at about $ 3 million. <PERSON> Liu </PERSON>, now a member of <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s air force, was at the news conference to show support for <PERSON> Chiang </PERSON>. Last year, gold rewards were cut by more than 50 percent after <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> abolished a similar practice of rewarding defectors from <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>. Officials said 14 Chinese military personnel have defected to <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> since 1949, when the Nationalists fled to this island after losing a civil war to the Communist forces on mainland <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> regards <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> as a renegade province and the two technically still are at war. More than a dozen Nationalist air force officers have sought asylum in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> since 1949. The most recent Nationalist defection was in February when Lt. Col. <PERSON> Lin </PERSON> <PERSON> Xianshun </PERSON> parachuted to safety as his F-5E jet crashed in a rice paddy in <LOCATION> Guangdong </LOCATION> province.

 A Soviet general who reportedly ordered an army assault that killed 19 demonstrators in the Georgian city of <LOCATION> Tbilisi </LOCATION> in April has been removed from his post, officials said Thursday. Col. Gen. <PERSON> Igor </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodionov </PERSON>, who was head of the <ORGANIZATION> Transcaucasian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION>, was replaced by Col. Gen. <PERSON> Valery </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Patrikeyev </PERSON>, said an editor at the official Gruzinform news agency in <LOCATION> Tbilisi </LOCATION>, the capital of the Georgian republic. Spokesman <PERSON> Vyacheslav </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirillov </PERSON> of the Soviet <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> confirmed that <PERSON> Rodionov </PERSON> had been removed Neither had any information on <PERSON> Patrikeyev </PERSON>. Nationalists have accused <PERSON> Rodionov </PERSON> of ordering soldiers armed with shovels and irritating gas to attack a crowd on <LOCATION> Tbilisi </LOCATION>'s Rustavelli Prospekt the night of April 9 The protest was a demonstration for more autonomy for the republic. Nineteen people were killed in the assault and another young man was shot for violating a curfew that was imposed later. <PERSON> Rodionov </PERSON> was chosen a representative to the national <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> Deputies parliament in March, and he staunchly defended himself during debate on the assault at the congress' first session. <PERSON> Rodionov </PERSON> said the protest turned into a `` pure orgy, with anti-Soviet slogans ... appeals to overturn the government, appeals to exterminate communists.'' A Georgian commission accused the military of a `` planned mass massacre.'' The removal of <PERSON> Rodionov </PERSON> also was noted in a dispatch by the <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency in a report on Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>'s visit to <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> told Georgian party officials they had made progress in mending ethnic relations since April but that it still was the most difficult problem they face.

<HEAD>House Votes to Reward Hungary's Economic Reform</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, eager to reward <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> for its steps toward economic openness and human rights, voted Thursday to grant the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact nation a three-year extension of preferential trade status. The 221-169 vote, over the objection of President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, sent the matter to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. The bill would grant an extension through July 4, 1992, of the most-favored-nation trading status <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> currently enjoys on a year-to-year basis. Sponsors of the bill said it was time to reward <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s moves toward a more Western-style market economy and relatively open emigration policies. `` For 25 years they have fought the communists, and they have turned that country around, and we have not done a damn thing to help them,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibbons </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., chairman of the Ways and Means trade subcommittee The original measure would have provided a five-year extension, but that was scaled back in a compromise with opponents, primarily conservative Republicans, who argued the gesture infringes on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s right to conduct foreign policy and diminishes pressure on <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> to keep the reforms going `` Let us remember that <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> remains a member in good standing of the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Gerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Solomon </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION>, speaking against the provision. `` This bill is an embarrassment to the people of <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> who have been fighting for their freedom. They want the pressure kept on their government to allow them to live where they want to live, work where they want to work, move where they want to move,'' he said. `` This is a fairly delicate time,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schulze </PERSON>, R-Pa., who helped work out the three-year compromise `` I do n't think we should let the emotional euphoria -LRB- over Hungarian reform -RRB- carry us into a policy we might regret. The five-year version of the bill had been rejected by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> in June when it failed to muster the two-thirds majority needed under the expedited floor procedure used to bring it before the chamber. At the time, opponents argued that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was about to travel to <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, including <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION>, and planned to annouce his own rewards for <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. During his trip, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> declared `` the Iron Curtain has begun to part'' and promised new trade benefits and a $ 25 million grant to spur free enterprise. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he would be inclined to grant permanent most-favored-nation status, which offers the best tariff rates available, if <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> adopts a liberalized emigration law now under consideration. Current law bars most-favored-nation status to communist countries with restrictive emigration policies. Since the ban was imposed in 1974, three nations have been granted waivers: <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. `` The president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> went over there and put his Good Housekeeping seal of approval on it,'' argued Rep. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., speaking for the bill `` This is a country that has proven over and over again that it wants to be free, open and democratic.''

 Representatives of the government of <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> and an Eritrean rebel group began preliminary talks at the Carter Presidential Center today in an effort to end the war that has raged between the two since 1961. Former President <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, acting as an observer at the closed-door talks, said the two sides agreed that no statements on the progress of the negotiations will be made until the open-ended sessions are complete. Delegations from the government and the <ORGANIZATION> Eritrean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> appeared with <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> at a news conference after arriving at the center <PERSON> Alamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohamed </PERSON> <PERSON> Saiyed </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> EPLF </ORGANIZATION> negotiating team, said through an interpreter that his people want a `` just and peaceful solution'' to the war. `` We realize that the path to peace is tortuous and requires patience and time. The Eritrean case can not be resolved either by evading it or by cover-ups,'' he said. `` It can not also be solved by running away from the truth or by playing some tricks.'' <PERSON> Ashegre </PERSON> <PERSON> Yigletu </PERSON>, head of the government delegation, said, `` We would like to affirm that the delegation ... is prepared to conduct these talks tirelessly and with the utmost patience, and in a new spirit of broad-mindedness.'' <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said he did not know how long the talks would last. He said the first order of business was an agenda. The former president stressed that the talks here are preliminary and that it would take further negotiations, with the top leaders of <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> EPLF </ORGANIZATION> participating, to produce concrete results. `` Both sides have limits with how far they want to go in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>,'' he said. An estimated 1 million people have died in the 28 years that the <ORGANIZATION> Eritrean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> has been fighting for independence. <LOCATION> Eritrea </LOCATION>, a former Italian colony, is a province of <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> and contains the troubled East African nation's only direct access to the <LOCATION> Red </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>. The Carter Center, which houses the presidential library, a museum, a think tank and foundations working for peace and public health, is trying to fill a gap by acting as go-between in the dispute. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> intervention is limited to disputes between nations. `` These are very intransigent, difficult, dividing issues that have never been addressed in a substantive way before,'' <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said recently. `` Of course my hope is, my expectation is, that we'll go from there to fairly sustained talks that might bring about a cease-fire.'' During his presidency, <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> served as a go-between in the Camp David talks that led to an accord between <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>. The Atlanta Constitution reported today that <LOCATION> Egyptian </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Hosni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> has been asked by both sides to serve as mediator if the <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> talks lead to further negotiations. <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> succeeded <PERSON> Anwar </PERSON> <PERSON> Sadat </PERSON>, who took part in the Camp David accords. Exactly when such long-term talks on <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> would be held and who would oversee them are matters the delegations hope to decide in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> has said.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> today approved 83-8 legislation shifting $ 45 million used for congressional mailings to a drug treatment program aimed at helping drug-addicted mothers and their babies. The lopsided vote came over strong opposition from Sen. <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Alaska </LOCATION>, who accused its backers of political posturing at the expense of lawmaker communications with constituents. Republicans proposed the measure Wednesday, the day after President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> announced a $ 7.9-billion anti-drug abuse campaign _ aimed at transferring the money from the account legislators use for their mailings. The provision was offered as an amendment to a bill providing $ 2 billion for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' own expenses for fiscal 1990, which begins Oct. 1. The proposal all but eliminates district-wide mailings used often by senators and representatives to keep their names in their constituents' minds, but it allows members to continue answering individual queries. Critics said the mass mailings provided taxpayer-financed publicity to incumbents, making them difficult to defeat. <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> had said Wednesday that such a dramatic cut in congressional mailings to constituents would deprive Alaskans of an important source of news. He said many Alaskans get no daily newspapers and learn of news from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> only from radio and brief television broadcasts. `` We send out a postal patron newsletter to people who have no other source of information about what's going on in the nation's capital,'' <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> told his colleagues But <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> lured few senators to his cause during today's debate, although Sen. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, D-Ill., did say he thought the amendment was `` not in the national interest Seven Democrats and one Republican voted against the amendment. They were: <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.J. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Hollings </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-S.C. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Inouye </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Hawaii </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Lieberman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Conn </LOCATION>.; <PERSON> Spark </PERSON> <PERSON> Matsunaga </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Hawaii </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Moynihan </PERSON>, D-N.Y. and the Republican, <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> Nine senators did not vote. Final action on the appropriations bill was put off until later in the day. The measure was proposed by Sen. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, R-Calif., a supporter of tougher efforts against drug abuse, a longtime critic of the burgeoning costs of legislators' mailings and a candidate for governor of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> `` What we are faced with is the opportunity to not spend on newsletters, and instead to put this money into one of the least well-funded'' drug programs, <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said. The money would go to a program started in 1988 that provides treatment to drug-addicted pregnant women, focusing on those who use crack. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said 400,000 babies are born annually to mothers who use drugs. In his Tuesday evening speech unveiling the $ 7.9 billion drug campaign, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> proposed spending $ 300 million for treatment programs. He listed initiatives to help pregnant drug users as part of the effort, but did n't specifically say how much should be spent for them. Without <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>'s amendment, the legislative spending bill would limit congressional spending on mail next year to $ 80 million: $ 48 million for the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, which has 435 members, and $ 32 million for the 100-member <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. The bill would also reduce from six to two the number of district-wide mailings permitted each year, except for notices of town meetings. Legislators could send more, but would have to pay for them out of the funds each receives for general office expenses. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is on track to spend $ 53.9 million on its mail this year, but those expenses traditionally skyrocket during election years, which 1990 happens to be. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> passed a $ 1.6 billion version of the legislative spending bill July 31 that would provide $ 124.7 million for congressional mailings. House and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> negotiators will have to find a compromise to their differences over congressional mail before the bill can be sent to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for his signature.

<HEAD>Sri Lankan Leader Invites Sinhalese, Tamil Rebels For Peace Talks</HEAD>

 The government has invited Sinhalese and Tamil rebels for peace talks with all political parties in a bid to end ethnic wars in which 16,000 people have been killed, officials said Thursday. Military officials said the latest violence, largely inspired by Sinhalese radicals of the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, had claimed 32 lives since Wednesday. The Sinhalese group is an ultranationalist guerrilla organization that has waged a campaign of assassinations and strikes to topple President <PERSON> Ranasinghe </PERSON> <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON>'s government. <PERSON> Bradman </PERSON> <PERSON> Weerakoon </PERSON>, the president's foreign affairs adviser, told reporters the government invited the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> and leaders of <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s 23 recognized parties to the proposed peace conference Sept. 13. `` We have positive responses from 10 parties. We have not received a single negative response. So for all intents and purposes there is a general acceptance of the government's invitation,'' said <PERSON> Weerakoon </PERSON>. He said the Sinhalese radicals are not among the 10 who have accepted, but they have not rejected the invitation. The group has rejected all previous peace overtures. <PERSON> Weerakoon </PERSON> said <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON> also had invited the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tamil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eelam </ORGANIZATION>, a dominant separatist group, and other former Tamil militant groups. Most groups of the minority Tamils ended their battle for an independent nation in the northeast two years ago following an accord that promised Tamils limited autonomy. But the <ORGANIZATION> Tamil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION> reneged on the peace plan and began attacking <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> peacekeeping soldiers deployed to supervise the accord, which was signed June 29, 1987. At least 1,000 soldiers have died in the fighting. At least 10,000 other people have been killed in the Tamil war. Most of the deaths occurred between 1983, when the Tamils took up arms, and 1987, when the accord was signed. After Tamil agitation subsided, Sinhalese radicals in the south and center of the island began fighting to protest the accord, which they said gives too many concessions to the minority Tamils, and an Indian troop presence they charge compromises <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s sovereignty Tamils form 18 percent of <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s 16 million people and say they are discriminated against by the Sinhalese who make up 75 percent of the population and control the government. Most Tamils are Hindu, while Sinhalese are mainly <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION>. The government says at least 5,000 people have died in the Sinhalese rebellion and blames the radicals for most deaths. The radicals say the military and pro-government vigilante groups are responsible for the killings. Among the 32 people killed in the latest violence were three soldiers blown up in a land mine blast Thursday, and another shot by Sinhalese extremists who ambushed troops bathing in a stream, the military officials said. They said they did not know who planted the land mine.

<HEAD>Business Spending Plans Show No Fear of Recession</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN D. McCLAIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Businesses plan to increase their plant and equipment spending by 7.7 percent this year, the government said Thursday in a report that analysts said shows no sign that industry fears an imminent recession. `` It's yet another indication the economy looks quite healthy,'' said <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinai </PERSON>, chief economist of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported that responses to a survey completed last month show that businesses expect to spend $ 463.95 billion on expansion and modernization this year despite earlier concern about a significant economic slowdown. If the plans are realized, capital spending this year would break last year's record. The department revised its 1988 spending figure to $ 430.74 billion from $ 423.69 reported earlier. All of the numbers are adjusted for inflation. Economists had worried that the economy, approaching its seventh year of growth, might be stalled by <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> efforts to halt inflation by restraining credit. However, interest rates began edging down last spring and a number of statistics since then have shown an economy that is slowing, though not as fast as previously thought. <PERSON> Sinai </PERSON> said the survey indicates `` nothing but a green go-light for the economy for the rest of the year.'' Plant and equipment spending is seen as a plus for the economy because it indicates continued expansion and eases inflationary pressures by increasing productive capacity. But economist <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Niemira </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> said corporate profits have been falling recently and the subsequent drain on cash flows is likely to have an effect on next year's capital spending `` Right now is the corporate planning time for next year when I think we will see a much reduced pace,'' he said. `` But for this year, the money has been allocated.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> surveys have shown a steady increase in capital spending plans for this year. In its first survey, conducted last December, companies had estimated their spending would rise 5.9 percent. Subsequent surveys showed spending plans up 6.3 percent in March and 6.5 percent in June. Capital spending grew a revised 8.9 percent in 1988 after a revised 4.2 percent gain in 1987. Plant and equipment spending fell 3.9 percent in 1986. Manufacturing companies estimated they would increase their spending by 6.1 percent to $ 178.24 billion in the latest survey, compared to a revised 11.7 percent advance in 1988. The new figure includes a 2.8 percent gain for plants that produce durable goods, big-ticket items expected to last more than three years, and a 9.1 percent gain for companies producing non-durable goods. Companies engaged in mining, transportation and other non-manufacturing ventures said they planned to increase capital spending by 8.7 percent to $ 285.72 billion. Before adjusting for inflation, 1989 capital spending is expected to rise 10 percent to $ 473.65 billion, compared with 10.5 percent in 1988.

 Two holdup men shot and killed an armored car guard and seriously wounded two other men today in the <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> headquarters building, police said. Witnesses said the gunmen fled on 10-speed bicycles. `` It looks like a well-planned, well-orchestrated robbery,'' said Deputy Chief <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Gurnett </PERSON>. It was not immediately known what, if anything, was taken. Police said it appeared the two robbers, in ski masks and baseball caps, followed a pair of <ORGANIZATION> Brink </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> guards into the 55-story building in the city's financial district and for some reason opened fire outside the indoor entrance to a <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> branch on the office tower's ground floor. A third man, drawn to the scene by the gunfire, was wounded in the mouth, said police Officer <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Ambrose </PERSON>. He said police received the first call at about 9:55 a.m. <PERSON> Ambrose </PERSON> said it also was not immediately clear if the Brink's truck was there to pick up or drop off cash The truck's driver remained with the vehicle as required by Brink's policy and was not injured, authorities said. Witnesses told police the holdup men fled on bicycles. `` We're trying to seal off as much as we can here and have an opportunity to arrest these people,'' <PERSON> Ambrose </PERSON> said. A spokeswoman at <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> said the dead guard had gunshot wounds in the face and the back of the head. The other guard was shot above the left eyebrow but was conscious, the spokeswoman said. The third victim was listed in stable condition.

<HEAD>Citywide Honesty Campaign Extended</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>COLUMBUS, Ohio (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An eight-month campaign to make honesty the best policy in <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION> has been extended to January, and if crime statistics are a measure, the extension is needed. `` Take an Honest Look,'' headed by <PERSON> Jeb </PERSON> <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> <PERSON> Magruder </PERSON>, Watergate conspirator-turned Presbyterian minister, was touted at its kickoff in January as the first phase of a bid to raise consciousness and discussion about ethics in daily life. Spokeswoman <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> McBurney </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Zimmerman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> said the <ORGANIZATION> Columbus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on Ethics and Values voted Wednesday to extend it until mid-January to allow several projects to be completed. One project is a change in school curriculum to include lessons in honesty. `` We will have some kind of a wrap-up event in January. We had to set an ending date _ some people on the commission never want it to end,'' she said. The extension also gives the panel time to determine how _ and if _ it will be able to gauge the campaign's effectiveness. <PERSON> Magruder </PERSON> said an attempt will be made this fall in conjunction with <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> to determine public opinion on the isse. `` Honesty is n't something you can measure,'' he said. `` But you can measure whether the message has been heard. Whether it sank in is another question altogether.'' But if crime statistics are any indication, the commission has more work to do. Overall, the rate of felony crimes as of June was up from last year, said <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, city police crime prevention coordinator. `` For the city of <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, the uniform crime index is up 8.2 percent in a comparison of January to June 1988 to the same period in 1989,'' he said. Cases of murder and manslaughter are up 20.5 percent from last year, vehicle thefts rose 28 percent and aggravated assaults were up 11.6 percent. However, the number of cases of forcible rape dropped by 24.9 percent, he said. Told about the increase in the crime rate, Ms. <PERSON> McBurney </PERSON> joked, `` Well, I guess we'd better not use those figures, then.'' <PERSON> Magruder </PERSON>, deputy director of communications in the administration of <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> and deputy director of <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> to Re-elect the President in 1972, went to prison after he admitted destroying records and committing perjury in the Watergate scandal. He was ordained a Presbyterian minister in 1981 and now serves at <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in suburban Marble Cliff. <PERSON> Magruder </PERSON> said he is pleased with the dozens of tales he has collected demonstrating individual acts of honesty. `` We had a woman return five bags of lottery tickets she found, and someone returned $ 100 from an automatic teller machine at the Columbus airport that was n't his,'' he said. `` And a woman from <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wayne </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, who stayed in a local hotel to attend a wedding left behind an envelope with cash in it. She forgot about it until she got home and was pleased and delighted to find out from the hotel clerk that somebody turned it in.'' The privately funded campaign has spread its word via billboards, public service announcements on radio and television, and one public forum. It also has sent information to schools to encourage teachers to include honesty in lesson plans. The commission's next effort, which will begin sometime early in the new year, will focus on respect and prejudice.

 A pregnant woman was abducted off the street, taken to an apartment and sexually assaulted by nine men and women for six hours, police said Thursday. The attackers also beat and tore clumps of hair out of the 25-year-old victim, who is seven months pregnant, said Officer <PERSON> Clyde </PERSON> <PERSON> Brandenburger </PERSON>. He said they used no weapons. The victim was treated for bruises at <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> and released, said nursing supervisor <PERSON> Edna </PERSON> <PERSON> Sistrunk </PERSON>. She said she could n't comment on the status of the pregnancy, but Detective <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> McNally </PERSON> said he believes the fetus survived. `` She says she was raped six or seven times and forced to perform other sexual acts during six hours,'' <PERSON> McNally </PERSON> said. `` This has happened before, but never with so many people involved.'' Three suspects _ <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON>, 31, <PERSON> Courtney </PERSON> <PERSON> Hicks </PERSON>, 36, and <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON>, 30, all of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> _ were arrested and charged with aggravated criminal sexual assault, <PERSON> McNally </PERSON> said. Police were seeking six other people, three men and three women. Investigators do n't believe illegal drugs were involved, <PERSON> McNally </PERSON> said. The victim had been a few miles from her home, visiting her sister, when two men grabbed her and dragged her into a nearby apartment where <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON> lives, <PERSON> McNally </PERSON> said. He said she apparently did n't know any of her attackers. After being repeatedly attacked, the victim was able to sneak from the bathroom to a back door and escaped from a rear window of the house, <PERSON> McNally </PERSON> said. The nude woman flagged down a police car and led officers to the apartment, where the three suspects were taken into custody, he said. Police recovered her clothes at the scene, and about $ 30 in cash she said had been stolen from her.

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> said Thursday that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> foreign policy is `` biased and shortsighted,'' then asked <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> help in what the <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> leader calls the war of liberation against Syrian troops in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> withdrawal of its last diplomats Wednesday was based on `` rumors, false suppositions and unconvincing reasons.'' He likened the 6-month-old battle between his 20,000 Christian soldiers and a Moslem alliance led by the 40,000 Syrians to what Americans' `` forefathers did ... 200 years ago'' in the Revolutionary War. Syrians and Christians exchanged artillery fire for five hours before dawn Thursday and police reported two dead and seven wounded. At least 830 people have been killed and 2,462 wounded since the artillery war began March 8. Nearly all the victims have been civilians. The U.S.-trained general said he would welcome the return of Ambassador <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> and other American diplomats to <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> only if <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> recognized his <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> as the legitimate government. His government competes for power with a Moslem Cabinet led by acting Premier <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON>. <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>, who had been in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> since the rival regimes were created a year ago, avoided taking sides by not presenting his credentials to either. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military helicopters evacuated the 30 remaining Americans from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy compound in east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> on Wednesday morning. `` It is pitiful that American-Lebanese relations should deteriorate to that point due to the stubbornness of the American Embassy ... backed by a biased and shortsighted foreign policy,'' <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> said. He was clearly angered by the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s declaration Wednesday that it evacuated the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomats because <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> threatened to expose them to a `` good dose of Christian terrorism.'' Speaking to reporters in his bunker under the shattered presidential palace in <LOCATION> Baabda </LOCATION>, east of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, the 54-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Maronite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> general urged the `` American people and their elected representatives to ignore their <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s policy.'' Americans should `` support all the <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION>, Moslems and Christians, in our war of liberation'' against the Syrians, he said. Syrian soldiers are in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> under a peacekeeping mandate the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> issued in 1976, the year after the sectarian civil war began. At least 150,000 Lebanese have been killed in the war. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said Wednesday that a leader of Christian youths who massed outside the embassy before the evacuation told diplomats they could move in and out of the compound only `` at their own risk.'' <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> said her remarks were `` a calculated but crude personal attack on me.'' `` It is an attack perhaps born of desperation rather than exasperation at the continued <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> resistance, and based at best on half truth, hearsay and downright black propaganda, at which we all know the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> excels,'' he told journalists. Ms. <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> quoted <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> as saying in an interview with the <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> newspaper <PERSON> Figaro </PERSON> that `` perhaps he should take 20 American hostages.'' In the interview published Sept. 1, <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> was asked whether the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was putting pressure on <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> not to aid him, and replied in part: `` They put pressure on everyone and claim in addition to have so acted because they have 10 hostages being held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. As if the war were being waged without hostages or victims. If I understand well, it would be enough that tomorrow I take 20 Americans hostage so that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> stops putting pressure on my friends.'' Eight Americans are among the 16 Western captives in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. After <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s news conference Thursday, Ms. <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> repeated her feeling about the remark to <PERSON> Figaro </PERSON>: `` I view it as a threat.'' <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> was not asked about it during the news conference. The general said he had assigned his `` best officers and soldiers'' to protect the embassy and American diplomats. He said the decision to evacuate them was `` unjustified ... because there have never been any victims or any hostage-taking in this region at all since the current events started.'' His reference was to the 310-square-mile enclave north and east of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> in which an estimated 1 million Christians live. It has been sealed off by the Syrians and their Moslem allies.

<TEXT>
 The nation's governors will prod President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to be a cheerleader for changes in schools, but few will seek more federal money when they meet him for an education summit, the governors' leader says. `` Sure, they'd like to see more money in some areas, but I think realistically they recognize that's not going to happen,'' said <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Branstad </PERSON>, a Republican who chairs the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. The governors will meet <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Sept. 27 and 28 in <LOCATION> Charlottesville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Branstad </PERSON> said he's surveyed all 50 to develop a list of priorities, which include drugs, improving support of teachers, raising literacy rates, dealing with `` at-risk'' youngsters and restructuring schools A few governors indicated they'll push for more money for college loans for low-income students, but most understand that `` our best hope is to try to get the administration to buy into giving the states more flexibility,'' <PERSON> Branstad </PERSON> said in an interview this week. Instead, the governors will ask <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to bring the visibility and muscle of the White House to a year-long effort to develop a national consensus for changes in education, <PERSON> Branstad </PERSON> said. `` He's the most visible person in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and if he decides to make something an issue, it's going to be an issue,'' he said. `` What we want to do is raise the visibility of education as a national agenda item.'' <PERSON> Branstad </PERSON> said the result could be the nation's first coordinated response to `` A Nation at Risk,'' a report critical of American education. `` We have n't really had a consensus response,'' <PERSON> Branstad </PERSON> said. `` We've had various experimentation and different things going on, some which has worked, some of which has n't.'' <PERSON> Branstad </PERSON> said some education reform efforts have failed because elected officials have n't worked to gain support. `` Governors and legislatures passed laws that said ` we will have better education.' It did n't work because it did n't get down to the people in the classrooms,'' he said. Representatives of the governors and <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> staffers are negotiating over the summit's format. The meeting will have many closed-door sessions, <PERSON> Branstad </PERSON> said. `` The president is interested in casual, candid and fruitful discussions between himself and the governors,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> aide <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Porter </PERSON> said in a memo. `` Therefore, there will be no outside speakers and very limited staff.''

<HEAD>House Defense Bill `Totally Unacceptable'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> denounced a House-passed defense bill as `` totally unacceptable to the commander in chief'' on Thursday and accused the chamber of holding the defense budget hostage to $ 20 billion in `` unneeded programs.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, in a speech to the American Legion that mixed defense and anti-drug themes, also praised Wednesday's decision by <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> president <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> to extradite a major drug figure to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The extradition of <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> <PERSON> Romero </PERSON> to face <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> drug money-laundering charges `` sends a strong signal of the courage and determination of President <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> and the <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> government to deal with the scourge which drugs are inflicting on all of us,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. Declaring `` Remember <LOCATION> Pearl </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also poked fun at his 1988 campaign gaffe _ to the same group one year ago _ confusing Pearl Harbor Day. `` Today, surprisingly, is Sept. 7. Can you believe it? And I'm determined not to repeat the mistake I made exactly one year ago when I referred to this as Pearl Harbor Day. A year ago, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, a World War II combat veteran, told the American Legion convention in <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>: `` I wonder how many Americans remember that today is Pearl Harbor Day.'' The Japanese air attack on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> naval base in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> occurred Dec. 7, 1941. The president, moving from drugs to defense, said Americans deserve protection from both `` the fear of war abroad -LRB- and -RRB- the fear of drugs and crime at home.'' But he claimed that the national defense was threatened by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> version of a defense spending bill for the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1. A House-Senate conference committee begins work on a compromise version Friday. While suggesting he could live with the Senate-passed bill, which preserves most of the administration's programs, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> declared: `` The House version is totally unacceptable to the commander in chief of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> armed forces.'' Congressional negotiators must reconcile rival versions of the legislation to authorize $ 295 billion in <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spending and $ 10 billion for defense programs in the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> refused to fully fund either of the two types of mobile intercontinental ballistic missiles <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wants. It chopped in half, to $ 502 million from $ 1.1 billion, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s request for the rail-based multiple-warhead MX; and it deleted all funds for the single-warhead Midgetman. The House bill `` contains unneeded programs costing nearly $ 20 billion from 1990 to 1994, holding our defense budget hostage to projects that will strip money from programs crucial to strategic modernization,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` Fellow veterans, real peace is not an accident, so let us modernize our strategic forces and thus encourage arms control,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. The president, a longtime <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legion </ORGANIZATION> member, wore a cap from his home post _ Post 77 in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> _ at the beginning and end of his appearance, although removing it for the speech. On drugs, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said his $ 7.9 billion anti-drug package, unveiled in a speech to the nation Tuesday, `` will require the bravery and sacrifice that Americans have shown before and must again.'' `` As veterans, you know how battles are often fought, house by house, block by block. Well, we'll win this battle the same way. We're going to win win it kid by kid, neighborhood by neighborhood,'' he said. To critics of the plan, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said: `` Some, incredibly, say it's not enough This from the very people who oppose the death penalty. It's that kind of thinking that's lost too many battles. `` So let's not let these critics lose the war,'' he added. `` I ask you to support our crime plan and also the other parts of our drug strategy.'' Afterwards, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> attended a ceremony at nearby <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> McHenry </LOCATION> marking the 175th anniversary of the War of 1812 battle against the British that inspired <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Key </PERSON> to write `` The Star-Spangled Banner.'' Standing before a 90-foot white flagpole, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> called the fort `` one of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s most hallowed shrines'' and said its small force of soliders had `` stopped a British invasion and preserved our independence.'' While <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> used his appearance before the American Legion to promote his drug plan and criticize the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>'s defense bill, one Republican lawmaker suggested using money for the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s B-2 stealth bomber to fund the anti-drug effort. Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rowland </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> said he will introduce legislation next week to cancel all procurement money authorized by the House for the stealth bomber in fiscal 1990 and transfer the funds to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s anti-drug program. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, in approving its version of the defense bill last month, authorized procurement of two stealth bombers, which at a cost of $ 530 million apiece are considered the most expensive planes in history.

<HEAD>Four Ill, One Critically After Eating Poisonous Wild Mushrooms</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. PAUL, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 One man remained in critical condition Thursday after he and three other people ate what experts described as the deadliest species of wild mushroom. `` It's the worst outbreak of amanita mushroom poisoning in at least 20 years,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>, medical director of the <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Poison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. The victims ate the amanita phalloides in two incidents Friday, one near <LOCATION> Siren </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, and the other by <LOCATION> Gull </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> north of <LOCATION> Brainerd </LOCATION>. All were taken to <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paul-Ramsey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. An unidentified 52-year-old man from <LOCATION> Isanti </LOCATION> was in critical condition. He had picked mushrooms Friday evening near <LOCATION> Siren </LOCATION> and cooked them into a creamed soup-like mixture that he shared with a friend, <PERSON> Sandy </PERSON> <PERSON> Barton </PERSON>, 32, of <PERSON> Blaine </PERSON>. The man ate about two bowls of the mushroom mixture; <PERSON> Barton </PERSON> ate just a little, and she was released from the hospital Tuesday. <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> said the man had liver failure. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Padrnos </PERSON>, 59, and his wife <PERSON> Yvonne </PERSON>, 52, who own the <LOCATION> Gull </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> Four Seasons Resort just north of <LOCATION> Brainerd </LOCATION>, were the other victims. <PERSON> Padrnos </PERSON> was discharged from the hospital Wednesday; his wife remained in the hospital and was improving steadily. The cases prompted health and plant experts to issue warnings about eating mushrooms picked in the wild. Mushrooms have flourished in the recent cool, wet weather and will be plentiful through early October, said <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, a plant pathologist at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION>. Only those who have been trained should pick mushrooms, <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> said. Amanita phalloides and its relatives resemble the edible field mushroom. <PERSON> Padrnos </PERSON> said he had some doubts about the safety of the mushrooms as he sliced them into a frying pan. `` They did n't seem just right,'' he said. `` So I fried them for a long time, 15 minutes. Dumb me, I did n't throw them out.'' <PERSON> Padrnos </PERSON> said he and his wife scooped the fried mushrooms onto pork chops and ate them. The last recorded amanita death in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> occurred in 1960, but there have been several non-fatal cases since then, <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said. Amanita phalloides contain amatoxin, a deadly poison that keeps recycling through the body, damaging the liver and sometimes the kidneys. <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> said there is no antidote for the toxin.

<HEAD>Iraq Says Explosion Killed 19, Not Hundreds</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Iraqi Embassy said Thursday that 19 people died in an explosion at a fuel depot outside <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>, contradicting reports by British media and Kurdish dissidents that at least 700 people died and that the site was a top-secret missile plant. The embassy said 19 firefighters and civil defense workers fighting a fire at a depot containing `` highly flammable gasoline materials'' were killed when a passing truck packed with explosives detonated. In a statement, the embassy said all the casualties were Iraqi nationals, and that a small number of workers suffered minor cuts when the explosion shattered the windows of passing buses. The fire was put out in a few hours, it said. The embassy said the truck was en route to a dam under construction in northern <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and its explosives were `` for use in engineering projects.'' An official of the <ORGANIZATION> Patriotic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kurdistan </ORGANIZATION>, an outlawed Kurdish movement fighting the <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> government, quoted sources in <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> on Wednesday as saying 700 bodies had been recovered. The official spoke on condition of anonymity. <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s Independent newspaper, quoting unidentified diplomats and <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> sources, also reported at least 700 people were killed, including Egyptian engineers helping the Iraqis develop a new ballistic missile. The embassy denied that a modified version of <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>'s medium-range Condor-2 surface-to-surface missile known as the Badr-2000 was being developed `` between <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and any other country including <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>,'' as news reports had said `` <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has already proved being self-sufficient in its technological capabilities, and it has produced middle-range missiles by developing a technology that is not yet available to <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> itself,'' the statement said. The embassy gave no further details about the facility between <LOCATION> Al-Hillah </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ad-Diwaniyeh </LOCATION>, about 40 miles south of <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>, which dissidents described as a top-secret missile plant. An embassy employee who answered telephone calls said the embassy was closed and no officials were available for comment.

 A man who fell into an 8-foot-deep drainage culvert lived there for a week without food, water or sleep but said he never gave up hope he would survive. `` I prayed to God. You better believe I prayed to God,'' <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Logsdon </PERSON>, 56, said in a telephone interview from his hospital room. `` But I never thought I would die. I knew I would get out. I always had hope.'' <PERSON> Logsdon </PERSON> was rescued Wednesday after a man collecting aluminum cans spotted him. He was in stable condition Thursday. <PERSON> Logsdon </PERSON> said he had been walking along <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> 61 in his hometown of <LOCATION> Canton </LOCATION>, in rural northeastern <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> near the <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> borders, on Aug. 30 or 31 when he moved to the shoulder of the road to avoid a passing car and fell into the culvert. `` I laid back in there because I did n't have the strength or energy to get up,'' he said. `` I was screaming for help but nobody heard me, so I just sat there.'' On Wednesday afternoon <LOCATION> Canton </LOCATION> resident <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> spotted <PERSON> Logsdon </PERSON> as he roamed the area collecting aluminum cans. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> called police and an ambulance. One of the first officers on the scene, state Trooper <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Schroeder </PERSON>, `` It was a miracle he was in such good condition.'' `` I have no doubt in my mind he was there for a week,'' <PERSON> Schroeder </PERSON> said. He said <PERSON> Logsdon </PERSON>, who has limited use of one arm and walks with a limp, is well-known in the community, and someone saw him the day he disappeared carrying yellow bags that were with him when he was rescued. <PERSON> Logsdon </PERSON>, who suffers epileptic seizures and lives with his brother and sister-in-law, also was in the habit of telling his family where he was going and when he would return home. It was n't clear whether a seizure contributed to his entrapment <PERSON> Logsdon </PERSON> also missed a dental appointment Sept. 1, and `` he would never miss a dental appointment,'' <PERSON> Schroeder </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Logsdon </PERSON>'s sister-in-law filed a missing-person report that day Authorities had searched extensively for him using helicopters and a ground sweep during the week.

<HEAD>State Department Says Quarter-Million Soviets May Seek Entry In 1990</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> estimated Thursday that up to 250,000 Soviet citizens will apply for admission to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1990. `` We are seeking ways to fairly and equitably respond to the expansion in demand,'' spokeswoman <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said. About half the applicants are Jews. Armenians comprise another large category, as do Pentecostal Christians. The spokeswoman denied published reports that because of the heavy flow some Soviet Jews would be declared ineligible. This would have the effect of diverting many of them to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was instrumental in persuading the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to lower is immigration barriers. The rising exodus is a mark of success, Ms. <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said, and `` we welcome it.'' Most Jews who leave the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> have permits to go to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. But the vast majority opt for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> once they reach <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>. A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> was receiving 10,000 applications a month from Soviet Jews for admission into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Another 10,000 a month were applying through the Dutch Embassy for emigration to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, he said. `` The rate is going straight up,'' he said. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration is pondering how to handle the situation, with a decision expected within a week or two. `` The administration is definitely not proposing to bar Soviet Jews from emigrating to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' Ms. <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said. `` We are not propsoing rules to make any Soviet Jews ineligible.'' Known to be under consideration is the addition of dozens of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> workers to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to handle the applications. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> also is considering a six-month waiiting period for Soviet Jews who do not have close relatives in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` We are seeking ways to fairly and equitably respond to the explosion in demand because of our successful efforts in pressing the Soviets to open emigration, `` Ms. <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said. She estimated that applications will be received from up to 100,000 Soviet nationals in the fiscal year that ends Sept. 30. `` In fiscal year 1990,'' she said, `` we expect that the number of Soviet applicants could increase to around a quarter of a million.''

<HEAD>West German Diplomatic Offensive Fails to Break Impasse Over Refugees</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government accused <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> on Thursday of trying to disrupt talks on the fate of 6,500 East German refugees awaiting passage to the West. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> launched a diplomatic offensive in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>, but the flurry of high-level talks failed to break an impasse on the refugees. More than 6,000 East Germans frustrated with the lack of reform under <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>'s rigid <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> leadership have escaped to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> through <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> in recent weeks. Another 6,000 are huddled in Hungarian tent cities and nearly 500 are in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>'s missions in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> demanding the right to emigrate to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> promised a week ago it would not force any East Germans to return home. West German politicians said the Hungarians had agreed to allow the refugees to migrate to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. However, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> has since refused to authorize the refugees' departure, calling on <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> to work out a solution <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> has taken the same view, the <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> indicated in a statement released late Thursday. It said Foreign Minister <PERSON> Hans-Dietrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> had dispatched a senior envoy, <PERSON> Dieter </PERSON> <PERSON> Kastrup </PERSON>, to meet with Czechoslovak Foreign Minister <PERSON> Jaromir </PERSON> <PERSON> Johanes </PERSON> to discuss the East Germans crowding <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>'s embassy there <PERSON> Johanes </PERSON> said the refugees' fate depended on an agreement between <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s chief of staff, <PERSON> Rudolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Seiters </PERSON>, met with <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s top diplomat here, <PERSON> Horst </PERSON> <PERSON> Neubauer </PERSON>, but a statement issued by <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> indicated the talks made little if any headway. `` The recent public comments from the East German side can only be seen as an attempt to disturb the negotiations and to shift responsibility elsewhere for resolving the problem,'' the government statement said. <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s ambassador to <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gerd </PERSON> <PERSON> Vehres </PERSON>, held a press conference for Hungarian reporters and restated <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>'s promise that those who return voluntarily will not be punished Vehres denied <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> demanded the refugees be forcibly returned but again characterized <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s decision to give them shelter as interference in domestic affairs. Hungarian government spokesman <PERSON> Zsolt </PERSON> <PERSON> Bajnok </PERSON> told reporters `` a few days are still required'' before the East Germans can be released, but he refuse to be more specific. There also were talks in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> on Thursday between officials of the <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> German </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>'s representative to <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Franz </PERSON> <PERSON> Bertele </PERSON> <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> does not recognize East German sovereignty, and therefore does not send an ambassador there. Both sides agreed to keep the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> talks confidential. According to the West German government statement, <PERSON> Seiters </PERSON> told <PERSON> Neubauer </PERSON> that <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> `` expressly rejected'' an accusation by the official East German news agency, <ORGANIZATION> ADN </ORGANIZATION>, claiming <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> had reneged on a deal to clear out the 116 refugees from the West German mission in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Seiters </PERSON> reaffirmed that <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> will not force anyone to leave the mission's protection, the statement said. <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact member that is seeking closer Western ties, has been caught in the middle of the diplomatic dispute, because its decision last spring to dismantle border barriers with <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> unwittingly provided a new escape route for East Germans. While East Germans face numerous obstacles to travel West, they can usually obtain permission to visit neighboring <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. The 6,000 being cared for in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> by international aid workers were mostly vacationers who decided against returning home after word spread that a one-time caravan to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> would be authorized by the Hungarian government. Many of those at the West German mission in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> were caught trying to cross illegally between <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and appealed to the West Germans out of fear they would be punished if they went back to <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>.

Mrs. <PERSON> Payson </PERSON> acquired it in 1952. `` This magnificent painting was in our parents' home in <LOCATION> Manhasset </LOCATION> for 27 years and, for a time, hung near van <PERSON> Gogh </PERSON>'s ` Irises,''' Mrs. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Roulet </PERSON> said in a statement. Her brother said in an interview that Mrs. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Roulet </PERSON> also displayed `` Au Lapin Agile'' prominently. But she became `` a bit nervous having the painting in her house'' because of the prices commanded by `` Irises'' and `` <PERSON> Yo </PERSON> <PERSON> Picasso </PERSON>,'' a 1901 self-portrait, sold for $ 47.8 million on May 9. The real clincher, said <PERSON> Payson </PERSON>, was in December, when Mrs. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Roulet </PERSON> discovered her grandsons playing with a dartboard near the Picasso. `` That seemed to be some kind of an omen,'' said <PERSON> Payson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Nash </PERSON> said it's difficult to set a presale estimate because of the unpredictable art market. `` This is much larger than ` <PERSON> Yo </PERSON> <PERSON> Picasso </PERSON>.' It is a much more complex painting, with considerable psychological tensions,'' he said. `` In a logical world, it should lead to a higher price.'' Part of the sale proceeds will be used to establish a foundation for medical research and education.

<TEXT>
 The flood of drugs into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has dried up since <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s latest round of violence began, raising the price of cocaine and shrinking the size of crack rocks, authorities said Thursday. But they warn the sudden drop in trafficking may be temporary, and could simply be the work of middlemen trying to drive up the price. The Miami-based <ORGANIZATION> Seventh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION>, which has accounted for 97 percent of the more than 10,000 pounds of cocaine intercepted by the entire service this year, has seen import activity suddenly grind to a halt, said Lt. Cmdr <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Karonis </PERSON>. `` We're still carrying out the same operations as we were, but the boats are n't coming out, and the air drops are n't happening _ the targets just are n't there.'' <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON>, outgoing head of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, said agents from his district, by far the busiest in the nation, had been tracking three to five air drops a week prior to the <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> crackdown. `` That has now come to a standstill,'' he said. `` There was only one right after the violence started, and we were n't even able to confirm that.'' The only recent major cocaine haul _ 800 pounds on a freighter in <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> on Saturday _ had been loaded and shipped before the violence began. Undercover agents trying to make cocaine buys have been put off for two to three weeks, and even though that period is about up, there are still no shipments ready, he said. The summer months have traditionally been the traffickers' busiest. In addition, money-laundering activity tracked by Customs is sputtering _ traffickers are still moving wire transfers for old cocaine shipments, but there are few new payments. <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> has also spotted the change, but agents there are n't sure if it marks a true disruption. `` Yes, there appears to be a slowdown of drug activity out of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, a fluctuation in distribution, and a rise in the wholesale price of cocaine,'' said <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernandes </PERSON>. `` But we do n't know if that's because of what's happening in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, or if entrepreneurs are trying to take advantage of what's happening to raise the price.'' <PERSON> Fernandes </PERSON> said the price of large cocaine shipments in the last two weeks has increased from $ 11,000 - $ 15,000 a kilogram to $ 18,000 - $ 19,000, with individual kilogram sales reaching as high as $ The scarcity is being felt on the street as well, says <ORGANIZATION> Metro-Dade </ORGANIZATION> police Cmdr. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Rothlein </PERSON>, head of the county narcotics bureau. Street prices for a kilogram of cocaine have shot up about $ 7,000, he said. `` Crack, on the other hand continues to sell for $ 10 dollar a rock _ but some of the rocks are getting smaller,'' said <PERSON> Rothlein </PERSON>. <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> attributes the disruption in part to the confiscation of planes used to carry cocaine from processing plants in southern <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> to coastal staging areas. The heads of the cartels are also having difficulties trying to control their operations while on the run, he said. But how long the situation lasts depends on whether the <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> government can keep up the pressure. <PERSON> Fernandes </PERSON> warns that the cocaine business is cyclical, just like any other commodity operation. `` There have been slowdowns before,'' he said. `` Slowdowns at different intervals ... are normal for the narcotics-trafficking business.'' He said other traffickers wait in the wings to replace anyone arrested or extradited, and planes and boats can be bought again quickly when the pressure is off.

<DATELINE>KANSAS CITY, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said it has begun a study to determine whether the morning and evening newspapers should be merged. Publisher <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hale </PERSON> said in a letter to employees Thursday that no decision has been reached and no deadline set for deciding whether to merge the The <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> with The <ORGANIZATION> Kansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>. The study began several weeks ago. `` For years there have been consistent rumors that publication of the afternoon paper would cease,'' the notice said. `` These rumors have been unsettling to our employees, readers and advertisers. The time has come to provide a definitive answer.'' The Star publishes weekday afternoons and Sunday morning. The Times publishes Monday through Saturday morning. The Star reported Thursday that some employees speculated after the letter was posted that the study would concern itself with ways to accomplish a merger rather than to determine the viability of The Star. <PERSON> Hale </PERSON> said that speculation was false. <PERSON> Hale </PERSON>, who became publisher in 1977 shortly after the company was acquired by <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said one of the first questions he was asked was how long <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cities </ORGANIZATION> would continue to publish the afternoon newspaper. He said Thursday that he did not have the answer then and does not have the answer now. The study will determine that, he said. `` I always said I did n't want to be here when that happened,'' <PERSON> Hale </PERSON> said. `` Nobody wants to preside over the death of a great newspaper, especially me.'' According to the 1989 edition of the Editor & amp; <ORGANIZATION> Publisher </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yearbook </ORGANIZATION>, the Times has a daily circulation of 281,886. The Star's circulation was listed at 184,882 daily and 408,916 on Sundays.

 An abortion-rights coalition of women's groups and religious, labor, business and advocacy organizations on Thursday announced plans for rallies in the nation's capital and in cities across the country this fall to kick off a nationwide political organizing effort. Under the banner `` Mobilize for Women's Lives,'' the groups said they will use the Nov. 12 rallies and other events in the states to register supporters to vote, to enlist their help in political organizing and to boost the campaigns of abortion-rights candidates. `` We will make it the political issue of 1989, 1990, 1992, and we will change the legislative halls of this country so that we have pro-choice legislators everywhere in the majority,'' said <PERSON> Molly </PERSON> <PERSON> Yard </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION>. Organizers said the coalition was formed before the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s July 3 decision giving states broad powers to regulate abortions. NOW had wanted to stage a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> rally this fall to protest the court ruling, but other groups wanted more state and community involvement in the demonstration. Abortion-rights groups brought hundreds of thousands of people to the nation's capital in April for one of the largest marches in recent years in the capital and the largest abortion-rights demonstration ever. Police estimated the crowd at 300,000; organizers said their numbers reached 600,000. Coalition leaders declined to estimate how many people they believe will participate in the Nov. 12 events, but <PERSON> Yard </PERSON> said she expected it would be in the millions. Organizers said the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> rally is intended to demonstrate the unity and strength of the movement, while the events in the states will be designed to recruit volunteers for political campaigning and abortion-rights education efforts. `` This will mark the 51-week countdown to the 1990 elections,'' said <PERSON> Kate </PERSON> <PERSON> Michelman </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Abortion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>. The groups will be signing up volunteers to ring doorbells, raise money, write letters and get out the vote at election time in their state and community, organizers said. Among the groups in the coalition are the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, Americans for Religious Liberty, Catholics for a Free Choice, <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Project </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Professional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clubs </ORGANIZATION>, People for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Way </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Planned </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parenthood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Physicians </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reproductive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>, Women's Legal Defense Fund and YWCA of the <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION>.

<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A national newspaper said Thursday that a nine-nation spy swap is being negotiated by the East German lawyer who arranged the 1986 release of Soviet dissident <PERSON> Natan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharansky </PERSON>. The Bonn-based daily <ORGANIZATION> Die </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Welt </ORGANIZATION> gave no source for its information but said lawyer <PERSON> Wolfgang </PERSON> <PERSON> Vogel </PERSON> was on a secret mission to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> over the weekend to work out the deal. Die <ORGANIZATION> Welt </ORGANIZATION> said the mass release of convicted spies would likely free two agents from <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> convicted of spying for the <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION>, as well as prisoners in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. West German government sources refused comment on the newspaper report, which said the spy swap was planned some time in the fall. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> also refused comment. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> denied the report. <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said: `` From time to time there are articles like this. It is certain that we are interested in exchanges of prisoners and hostages, but we have no information on what was printed. No one has spoken to us on this and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> was not involved in this story.'' <PERSON> Arne </PERSON> <PERSON> Strand </PERSON>, a spokesman for Norwegian Prime Minister <PERSON> Gro </PERSON> <PERSON> Harlem </PERSON> <PERSON> Brundtland </PERSON>, said `` The government is completely unaware of any such spy swap.'' Die <ORGANIZATION> Welt </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Vogel </PERSON> refused to discuss the reported deal when asked by the newspaper for details. The 63-year-old <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> lawyer has arranged other spy swaps in the past, including the 1986 exchange that allowed <PERSON> Sharansky </PERSON> to emigrate to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The newspaper said <PERSON> Shabtai </PERSON> <PERSON> Kalmanovich </PERSON>, sentenced to nine years in an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> prison for his conviction of spying for the Soviet <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION>, was one of the prisoners being considered for release. It also named a Professor <PERSON> Glinberg </PERSON>, without giving his first name, who <ORGANIZATION> Die </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Welt </ORGANIZATION> said was an expert on chemical warfare. The man referred to is believed to be <PERSON> Marcus </PERSON> <PERSON> Klingberg </PERSON>, sentenced in 1983 to 18 years imprisonment in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> for spying for the Soviets. Die <ORGANIZATION> Welt </ORGANIZATION> said the Soviets were also seeking the release of <PERSON> Dieter </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerhardt </PERSON> from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dieter </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerhardt </PERSON>, a former admiral, is serving a life sentence while his Swiss-born wife is serving a 10-year term. They were arrested in 1981, the paper said. <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> is involved through the case of former government official <PERSON> Arne </PERSON> <PERSON> Treholt </PERSON>, who was convicted of spying for the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and sentenced to 20 years in jail, the newspaper said. He was arrested in 1984. But <PERSON> Treholt </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> Arne </PERSON> <PERSON> Haugestad </PERSON>, ridiculed the report. `` This is nothing but a cock-and-bull story,'' <ORGANIZATION> NTB </ORGANIZATION> state news agency quoted <PERSON> Haugestad </PERSON> as saying. <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s secret service was hoping to win the release of <PERSON> Reinhard </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sonja </PERSON> <PERSON> Schulze </PERSON>, a couple arrested in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, according to Die Welt. The East Germans also reportedly wanted the release of an agent captured in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and were in return ready to release a number of Western agents caught in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Die </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Welt </ORGANIZATION> said. Die Welt did not specify any agents convicted in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agents serving sentences abroad.

<HEAD>Hispanic Vote `Up For Grabs,' Survey Says</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Hispanic immigrants register to vote at a significantly higher rate than most Americans and are `` almost up for grabs'' by both Republicans and Democrats because many have not decided which party they favor, a Latino group said in announcing results of a survey Thursday. The telephone survey of 1,635 immigrants from 17 nations showed that 81 percent of the naturalized immigrants are registered to vote, compared with 70 percent of the general <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> voting age population, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Latino </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elected </ORGANIZATION> and Appointed Officials said. Forty-nine percent of those interviewed, all of whom were either naturalized citizens or legal permanent residents of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, said they had `` no preference'' between the major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> political parties. `` This is a large population that is almost up for grabs,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Roybal </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Calif </LOCATION>., president of the association's educational fund, which conducted the `` Republicans and Democrats have an open field to go out into the Latin community and convince them that their party and platform is the best,'' said <PERSON> Roybal </PERSON>, a Hispanic from a <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> district with the heaviest concentration of Hispanics in his state. He said the <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION>, and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> in particular, `` will have a vast reservoir of people who have n't made their minds up yet, but they do register.'' `` Despite the myths of the past, they will be registering in high numbers and will be getting out to the polls in high numbers,'' <PERSON> Roybal </PERSON> said. The study gave no overall figure on the number of Hispanic immigrants in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, but said more than one-and-a-half million have legally entered the country in the past decade and they will soon be the largest ethnic minority in the country. A study in April by the Center for Political Studies at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> showed that among Hispanic citizens who had made a choice, 63 percent of Cubans considered themselves Republicans, 9 percent Democrats, 13 percent independents and 16 percent no preference. The corresponding figures for Mexican immigrants were 42 percent Democrat, 16 percent <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION>, 10 percent independent and 33 percent no preference. For immigrants from other Latin American countries, the figures were 34 percent Democrat, 28 percent <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION>, 10 percent independent and 27 percent no preference. The numbers do n't add up to exactly 100 percent because of rounding. Twenty-seven per cent said they had attended political fund-raisers or contributed money, 9 percent had written letters on political issues and an equal percentage had taken part in canvassing or marching. Five percent said they had distributed political literature and 4 percent said they had helped people register or vote. <PERSON> Roybal </PERSON> said he believed the survey indicates that more Hispanics will be elected to office `` in years to come, perhaps after the year 2000.'' He said political participation by <PERSON> Hispanics </PERSON> would give them leverage to help prevent state legislatures from drawing congressional district lines, after the 1990 census, that are `` gerrymandered to keep them out.'' Results of the survey are particularly important `` because this is a group that many believe will not be fully counted in the next census,'' <PERSON> Roybal </PERSON> said. The survey also showed that 95 percent of those responding said an important reason for wanting to become a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizen is that it allows you to vote. The survey was conducted in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>. Nearly half of those interviewed were from <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and one-fourth from <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. The principal other countries of origin included the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION>. The association claims a membership of more than 3,300 Hispanic elected officials, appointed officials and community and business leaders. It did not give a margin of error for its survey.

<HEAD>Iraqis Ready To Swap POWs Unconditionally</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A top <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> official said Thursday his country is ready for a comprehensive, unconditional exchange of prisoners-of-war with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. A former Iranian official still close to the government declared there has never been a better time for reaching a full peace settlement with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. Speaking at the summit of the non-aligned movement in <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> Deputy Premier <PERSON> Taha </PERSON> <PERSON> Yassin </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramadan </PERSON> said his country was prepared for a full exchange of all POWs with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, regardless of the lack of progress on other issues in the peace talks. His remarks were carried by the <ORGANIZATION> Iraqi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>. Talks on implementing U.N. Resolution 598, which halted the war Aug. 20, 1988, began five days after the cease-fire. But the talks stalled almost immediately and have been deadlocked since. The last round of talks, held in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> in April, broke down in an acrimonious stalemate. The deadlocked peace talks have left an estimated 100,000 men held by both sides languishing in POW camps. The <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, quoted <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Javad </PERSON> <PERSON> Larijani </PERSON>, a former deputy foreign minister close to newly elected President <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, as writing that `` There has never been such a good chance of attaining peace as there is now. One should appreciate such chances.'' <PERSON> Larijani </PERSON>, whose remarks quoted by <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> were carried in the daily <ORGANIZATION> Ettelaat </ORGANIZATION>, said that was partly because the Iraqis were desperate to rebuild their war-shattered economy. No new peace talks between <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> are scheduled. The Iraqis insist on direct talks with the Iranians without <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> mediation, but <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has refused. After the last round of talks broke down, the Iraqis proposed exchanging POWs. The Iranians refused, insisting that the full <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peace resolution must be implemented step by step. The resolution calls for withdrawal of troops to internationally recognized boundaries, the exchange of POWs, and dredging of the <LOCATION> Shatt-Al-Arab </LOCATION> waterway, which is shared by both sides according to a 1975 agreement but which is cluttered with war debris. The talks have been stalled over <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s insistence that Iraqi troops withdraw from some 385 square miles of its territory before the talks can continue. But the Iraqis reject the 1975 Algiers Treaty which drew the border in the middle of the Shatt-Al-Arab. They insist that the border must be redrawn along the Iranian bank of the Shatt to include all of the waterway in Iraqi territory.

 Hundreds of bats descended on downtown in daylight, many dying on streets and sidewalks, and officials are not sure why. `` I have never seen bats on the sidewalk at 4 o'clock in the afternoon before,'' said <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Farkas </PERSON>, who estimated there were 50 to 100 bats on the ground outside his restaurant just before the Wednesday evening rush hour. <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Derosa </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Humane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> found 100 more bats on a sidewalk nearby and said at least 1,000 were hanging from the eaves of a building. Another Humane Society official, <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Buffington </PERSON>, said Thursday that no one was sure whether the bats had been poisoned or suffered heat stroke. The temperature reached 96 degrees Wednesday afternoon. `` My concern was that we got this call at 4:15 yesterday and most of the employees in these downtown buildings would be coming out and there would be these tiny little things on the ground,'' Ms. <PERSON> Buffington </PERSON> said. `` I was concerned about a health problem.'' Bats become disoriented in daylight, but if they are not too sick they probably could regroup after nightfall, said <PERSON> Dudley </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, assistant director of the <ORGANIZATION> Fort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Worth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zoo </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Humane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> had received no reports of bats downtown Thursday morning, Ms. <PERSON> Buffington </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Attackers Fire Rockets Into Israel From Jordan</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Attackers fired several rockets Thursday from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> into <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, and a news report said a <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> faction claimed responsibility. The government demanded that <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> do a better job of policing its border. There were no casualties in the attacks, but Israelis living along the border expressed concern that the generally quiet boundary might be changing into a line of confrontation. Jordanian officials said at least one rocket fell on their side of the border and that they were checking the source of the firing. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio reported that a Syrian-backed Marxist faction of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, the Popular Front for the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION>, claimed responsibility for the attack in a statement released to <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monte </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carlo </ORGANIZATION>. `` We still do not think that <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>'s policy of ensuring the security and quiet of the border between us has changed,'' Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said on Israeli television's Arabic language service. `` But all the incidents that have occured lately require caution and alertness.'' When asked what <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> should do following the raid, <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said: `` First of all, they must prevent this. This is their responsibility.'' Foreign Minister <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> echoed <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s comments in an interview on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> television. `` It is certain that the <LOCATION> Jordanian </LOCATION> government is responsible for every terrorist act whose source is <LOCATION> Jordanian </LOCATION> territory,'' <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> said. `` We are asking the government of <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> to take action ... to prevent such acts in the future.'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said the attack could be the result of recent Jordanian moves at a rapprochement with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. `` It could be that as a result of some improvement in ties between the government of <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> men were given more freedom to act in <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and this -LRB- attack -RRB- could be the result,'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said. The rocket attack was the second incident in a week and the fifth this year across a normally quiet border. The other attack was Saturday when an infiltrator shot and killed one Israeli soldier and fatally wounded another. Israeli newspapers have reported that the army asked farmers who live along the border to carry weapons when they go to their fields. <PERSON> Menachem </PERSON> <PERSON> Regev </PERSON>, secretary of a collective farm near where the rockets fell, said on army radio there was concern about the growing number of incidents, which were the most frequent since a four year war of attrition that started in 1969. `` It's like we're returning to the situation of 20 years ago,'' <PERSON> Regev </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> does not permit cross border attacks and expelled <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> guerrillas in a 1970-71 civil war, sharply reducing such attempts. But some radical Syrian-based Palestinian groups have occassionally tried to use <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> as a launching pad for raids.

<TEXT>
 The government said Thursday that a visit by <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>'s defense minister has been canceled, an apparent result of the deteriorating relations between the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact allies. `` <PERSON> Ilie </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>, Romanian deputy minister of national defense, is not to visit <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, in spite of preliminary plans,'' the official <ORGANIZATION> MTI </ORGANIZATION> news agency quoted Hungarian Defense Minister Col. Gen. <PERSON> Ferenc </PERSON> <PERSON> Karpati </PERSON> as saying. <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON> is the brother of Romanian leader <PERSON> Nicolae </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> MTI </ORGANIZATION> did not say which nation canceled the visit. A date for it was never announced. Hungarian officials had been criticized for weeks over the planned visit. Reporting on the cancellation, the government daily <ORGANIZATION> Magyar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hirlap </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Karpati </PERSON> told reporters that `` Hungarian youth is opposed to the visit of the Romanian general.'' The <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact countries are seriously split over the plight of 1.7 million ethnic Hungarians in <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION> claims no wrongdoing, but <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> says Romanian citizens face discrimination and has given 18,000 of them asylum during the past two years. The actions flout an agreement obliging <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> to return Romanian citizens fleeing over the countries' border. The two nations also have disputed control of <LOCATION> Transylvania </LOCATION>, which is under control of <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>. The bitterness between the Soviet bloc countries also stems from changing politics. Under <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>'s undisputed one-man leadership, <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> prohibits dissent <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, meanwhile, has moved toward reform and next year plans to hold the nation's first free elections since the Communists consolidated power more than 40 years ago. <PERSON> Ilie </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>'s planned visit first was announced in the July 14 issue of <LOCATION> Nephadsereg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s military weekly. <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s fledgling political opposition parties and some senior <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> officials immediatey criticized the plan. Central Committee member <PERSON> Matyas </PERSON> <PERSON> Szueros </PERSON>, the speaker of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, said he found it `` incomprehensible.'' He accused the Romanian leadership of an `` official political campaign'' to persecute the Hungarian minority and said bilateral relationships had `` hit bottom.'' He also called <PERSON> Ceausescu </PERSON>'s leadership an example of `` degenerate socialism,'' and called for <LOCATION> Transylvanian </LOCATION> autonomy. Tensions even have caused senior <LOCATION> Hungarian </LOCATION> officials to express concern about <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>'s defense policies. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Gyula </PERSON> <PERSON> Horn </PERSON> told reporters in July it would be `` irresponsible'' to ignore signals from <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>, referring to claims by <LOCATION> Bucharest </LOCATION> that it was capable of manufacturing nuclear weapons and was thinking of acquiring mid-range missiles.

 The reputed financial wizard of the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cocaine cartel arrived under guard at a tiny, out-of-way airport before sunrise Thursday, the first of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s `` Extraditables'' brought to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for trial. The extradition of <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> <PERSON> Romero </PERSON>, an alleged money-launderer for the drug cartel that is believed to supply 80 percent of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s cocaine, came days after President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> declared war on <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s cocaine barons. <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, 36, was put on a <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> plane in <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> on Wednesday night. He arrived at 4 a.m. outside <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> at <LOCATION> Charlie </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brown </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, an airfield used mostly by private planes, and was whisked to court by helicopter. Hours later, after the government obtained an interpreter for him, he appeared before <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Magistrate <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Feldman </PERSON> and told him he speaks only Spanish and does not fully comprehend the money-laundering charges against him. <PERSON> Feldman </PERSON> postponed arraignment until Monday and ordered <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> held without bail at an undisclosed site. Defense attorney <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Garland </PERSON> said even he had not been told where <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> was being held. Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Wilmer </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> said he will ask that bail be denied. Security at the courthouse was unremarkable, despite the wave of bombings associated with <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s crackdown on drugs, which resulted in <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>'s arrest Aug. 20. <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> was not handcuffed or shackled in court. The <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cartel's reputed money man is on the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>' list of so-called `` Extraditables,'' <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s most important drug kingpins <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, who told the judge he holds a post-graduate degree is marketing, is accused of laundering up to $ 27 million in drug profits by funneling the cash through <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> banks, including one in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. He is the first person extradited to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> since <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s crackdown began last month. <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> has previously denied any links to the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cartel, which the government claims is the largest cocaine operation in the world. `` Based on what I heard today I would anticipate he will enter a plea of not guilty,'' said <PERSON> Garland </PERSON>. The <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> lawyer said he was contacted by a member of <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>'s family. <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> was indicted in March in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> as a result of an investigation code-named Operation Polar Cap, which officials said revealed an operation that laundered billions in cocaine profits. Charges were brought against 127 people and two Latin American banks. In March, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities enlisted the aid of Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s military to help arrest <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> while he was inside a bank <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. But <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> slipped through the dragnet, according to the <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION>. He was arrested in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> the first weekend after Colombian President <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> launched a drug crackdown prompted by the Aug. 18 assassination of a presidential candidate and outspoken foe of the drug trade. Included in the emergency measures imposed by <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> was a re-institution of the extradition agreement with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> that had been thrown out by the <ORGANIZATION> Colombian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in 1987. In response to the crackdown, the cocaine barons declared `` total war'' on the government and have carried out bombings and shootings in <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>, home of the drug cartel, and in <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>, the capital. <PERSON> Weldon </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, the agent in charge of the <ORGANIZATION> Atlanta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> office, said federal agents were `` on an increased state of alert'' against any retaliation. Federal officials would provide no details on the alert. `` We're very concerned because of the events transpiring and because of the violence that has occurred in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said. He said some cartel members reportedly have said `` there might be ... some violent act attempted in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> because of the extradition.'' The last trafficker to be extradited to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON>, a leader of the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cartel who was sent to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in early 1987 and is serving a life sentence in the federal prison in <LOCATION> Marion </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Garland </PERSON> told reporters after the hearing that President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s speech Tuesday outlining a battle plan for a war on drugs may whip public opinion into such a frenzy that <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> can not get a fair `` The speech probably expressed accurately the feeling of the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people,'' said <PERSON> Garland </PERSON>. `` My concern is that in our frustration over the drug problem, we will ignore our other freedoms. He, like anyone else in our country, should be presumed innocent.''

 Egyptian President <PERSON> Hosni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> ended a diplomatic mission to <LOCATION> Senegal </LOCATION> and neighboring <LOCATION> Mauritania </LOCATION> on Thursday and promised further efforts to resolve the bloody ethnic and racial dispute between the countries. <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>, acting in his role as president of the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unity </ORGANIZATION>, said before leaving the Senegalese capital for <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> that a panel of <ORGANIZATION> OAU </ORGANIZATION> ministers would meet Oct. 5 at the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> to study the problems causing the conflict. An initially minor border dispute between the two <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> African </LOCATION> nations in April has erupted into an ethnic and racial dispute between the predominantly black, French-speaking Senegalese and the mostly Arabic-speaking Moors of <LOCATION> Mauritania </LOCATION>. The conflict has left hundreds of Mauritanians and Senegalese dead in each other's countries and thousands more without homes or property. <LOCATION> Senegal </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mauritania </LOCATION> broke diplomatic relations Aug. 22. <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> arrived in <LOCATION> Mauritania </LOCATION> on Wednesday for talks with the chief of state, Col. <PERSON> Muawiya </PERSON> <PERSON> Ould </PERSON> <PERSON> Sid </PERSON> <PERSON> ` </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Taya </PERSON>, and later flew to <LOCATION> Senegal </LOCATION> for an overnight visit with President <PERSON> Abdou </PERSON> `` There are points that need to be discussed,'' <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> said, expressing hope that the <ORGANIZATION> OAU </ORGANIZATION> commission will eventually produce a settlement to the conflict.

<HEAD>Measles Up Dramatically This Year After Two Year Decline</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 More than 10,000 measles cases were reported in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in the first eight months of this year _ three times the number reported all last year. The national <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> blamed the 1989 increase, which follows two years of declines, on the failure to vaccinate young children and ineffective vaccinations. The <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday that 10,115 cases of the once-widespread childhood disease had been reported through last week. That's nearly five times the 2,170 cases reported at the same time last year and also is well above the 3,411 reported for the entire year in 1988. This year has seen a large number of outbreaks, most of them in the nation's high schools and colleges, the Atlanta-based <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said. So far this year, more than 90 measles outbreaks have been reported, including one large outbreak among unvaccinated preschoolers in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, which struck more than 1,700. The unvaccinated young children, particularly in outbreak-prone inner cities, are one of two major impediments to wiping out measles in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said in its weekly report. The other is the failure of vaccinations to protect some people, which has allowed outbreaks in `` highly vaccinated'' school populations. The <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> earlier this year recommended a second dose of measles vaccine for children beginning kindergarten or first grade. Everyone born since 1957 _ when measles was so widespread that Americans had some natural immunity _ is considered a potential measles risk. `` It would be an expensive, exhaustive undertaking to revaccinate everybody born since 1957,'' but revaccinating children upon school entry should `` start chipping away'' at the problem, said Dr. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Wassilak </PERSON>, a CDC immunization specialist. The <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> also has recommended earlier vaccinations for inner-city children _ as early as 9 months, rather than the standard 15 months _ to try to prevent large outbreaks, and revaccinations for certain children in the case of school measles outbreaks. Specifically, the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> recommended outbreak revaccinations for students who were vaccinated before 1980 or vaccinated between the ages of 12-14 months. In both cases, the agency said, studies have shown diminished vaccine effectiveness. `` The two-dose schedule and intensive efforts to raise ... immunization levels should facilitate the goal of measles elimination in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said. But <PERSON> Wassilak </PERSON> cautioned that measles rises and falls in cycles, to some degree, and `` even if next year is low, that's not inconsistent. There's not going to be an immediate effect; it's going to take a while for the new policy to deter a significant number of measles cases. Federal health officials believed measles eradication was within reach early in this decade, when only a few remaining clusters of the disease remained. However, measles reporting then increased between 1983 and 1986. The 1989 total is already the highest since 1980, when 13,430 cases were reported in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The disease fell to a record low of 1,497 cases in 1983, but increased in 1984,'85 and'86, before beginning another decline, from 6,282 cases in 1986 to 3,652 in 1987 to the 3,411 in 1988. All this, however, pales in comparison to the prevaccine levels; more than half a million cases a year were routinely reported in the 1950s. A measles vaccine became available in the early 1960s.

<TEXT>
 Representatives of the Ethiopian government and an Eritrean rebel group shook hands and began preliminary talks Thursday aimed ending their 28-year-old war. Former President <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> is acting as a neutral observer for the private talks at The Carter Center. The talks are expected to last three days, though no time limit has been set; the goal, <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said, is to pave the way for more substantive negotiations later. <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> and the rebels are warring over the independence of <LOCATION> Eritrea </LOCATION>, a province that holds <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>'s only direct access to the <LOCATION> Red </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>. An estimated 1 million people have died in the conflict and its related famine. Officials of the two delegations said Thursday they are eager for peace, but made it clear that profound differences exist. `` The Eritrean case can not be resolved by running away from the truth or by playing some tricks,'' said <PERSON> Alamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohamed </PERSON> <PERSON> Saiyed </PERSON>, head of the Eritrean delegation. `` The search for peace ... should not be viewed as a subterfuge to buy time, or, still worse, as part of military maneuvers and tactics of war,'' said <PERSON> Alamin </PERSON>, a member of the Politburo of the <ORGANIZATION> Eritrean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Ashegre </PERSON> <PERSON> Yigletu </PERSON>, head of the government delegation, said <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> has tried repeatedly during the past 15 years to end the conflict peacefully. `` It is our view that these peace talks should start off in an atmosphere that avoids polemics and recrimination and constructively lead to the restoration of peace in the northern part of our country,'' said <PERSON> Ashegre </PERSON>, head of the government <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>'s Foreign Relations Department Meeting with reporters, <PERSON> Alamin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ashegre </PERSON> each sat stone-faced as the other delivered his opening statement in Arabic, followed by an English interpretation. But, prodded by <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, they rose at the end of the meeting and shook hands. No public statement on the talks will be issued until they end, as both sides agreed that issuing progress reports would be counterproductive, <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said. `` With the success and building of confidence here in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, the possibility of a cease-fire and unimpeded delivery of relief supplies would be facilitated,'' he said. The Atlanta Journal-Constitution on Thursday quoted unidentified diplomats as saying <LOCATION> Egyptian </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Hosni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> would mediate further talks if the preliminary sessions succeed. A <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> agreement federated <LOCATION> Eritrea </LOCATION>, a former Italian colony, with <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> in 1952. Rebel groups began forming in the early 1960s when they did not get self-rule and <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> unilaterally annexed the area. <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> considers the conflict a war of secession. The <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> talks are under the auspices of an informal group called the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Negotiating </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>, which includes scholars and former diplomats and operates out of The Carter Center. The meeting is the network's first effort. <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> is acting as a private citizen in the talks, though the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration has wished him well and <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> has said he will keep the administration informed. As president, <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> withdrew <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> assistance to <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>, but <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has indicated a desire to thaw the relationship between the two nations.

<HEAD>Bill Allows Federal Agencies to Repay Some Student Loans</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 With the hope of luring talented young professionals into public service, a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel approved a bill Thursday to allow federal agencies to repay outstanding student loans of some employees. On a voice vote, a subcommittee sent to the full <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> the legislation, which authorizes a federal agency to repay up to $ 6,000 of an employee's federal student loan debt in any calender year. The measure also would give agencies the flexibility to pay or reimburse employees for degree training in certain occupations. The Subcommittee on <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> also passed on a voice vote a bill to prevent the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> and other agencies from stacking performance review boards with political appointees. It merely clarifies sections of the Civil Service Reform Act by requiring agencies to have a majority of career appointees on review boards when making performance award recommendations. The subcommittee chairman, Rep. <PERSON> Gerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Sikorski </PERSON>, D-Minn., said <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>'s present policy `` not only circumvents the spirit of the Civil Service Reform Act, but also undermines the very goal of a performance award system `` Instead of instituting a system which motivates and awards individuals for successful performance, <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>'s policy threatens to politicize and void the award process,'' he said. The full committee chairman, Rep. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Mich </LOCATION>., introduced the student loan bill Subcommittee members passed the measure with little fanfare or discussion because <PERSON> Sikorski </PERSON> offered an amendment that addressed most of the problems raised by the administration during a July hearing. Under the amended bill, an agency may repay a total of $ 40,000 of an employee's student loan indebtedness. Employees can not be reimbursed for any loan payments made before the job began and must agree in writing, before receiving the benefit, to remain at the agency for a specified period, not less than three years. In selecting workers for the program, an agency is required in the bill to follow `` merit principles taking into consideration the need to maintain a balanced workforce representative of the racial, female-to-male ratio and ethnic makeup of our society.''

<HEAD>Nine States Want All to Share Cleanup Costs</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Lawmakers representing nine states demanded Thursday that the entire country share the cost of cleaning up their states' acid rain emissions, but colleagues said states that foul the air should foot the bill. `` The country owes some help to those asked to do more,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharp </PERSON>, D-Ind., who is chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> energy and power subcommittee and represents one of the coal-producing states that contribute to acid rain `` We are talking about economic justice for the country,'' <PERSON> Sharp </PERSON> said at a hearing of the subcommittee. The regional conflict, which has been festering for years, erupted anew with added urgency because President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and lawmakers from both parties are pushing for a new clean air bill. The question of who pays to clean up acid rain that is fouling lakes and killing trees would have to be resolved before such a bill is passed. Lawmakers from the nine states say their electric utilities produce 50 percent of the nation's acid rain pollution, but would have to finance some 67 percent of the cleanup under <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s plan and other bills. The extra cost would likely be passed on to consumer and business electric bills in those states. That idea is vigorously opposed by miners who produce high-sulfur coal that is burned exensively in the nine states: <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Trumka </PERSON> told the hearing up to 30,000 miners could be thrown out of work by the year 2000 unless other regions share the costs. Utilities would simply adopt the cheapest solution, he said, and switch to other fuels rather than installing expensive pollution-reducing equipment. <PERSON> Sharp </PERSON> said it `` galls us'' that the nine states would pay `` more than our fair share.'' But Rep. <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Moorhead </PERSON>, R-Calif., said other states have already paid to clean up their air `` The other 41 states have cleaned up their act'' and customers are financing anti-pollution efforts with higher utility bills. `` The nine states have the cheapest rates,'' he said. `` <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> has had to do away with all our coal-fired plants'' and adopted technology that includes expensive solar energy and wind machines, he said, asking why the 41 states `` should pay for states that have not cleaned up their act.'' Rep. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Bilirakis </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Fla </LOCATION>., argued that states such as <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> `` went to the expense, they went to the trouble Now you're saying we should bear part of the cost. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> plan calls for reducing sulfur dioxide emissions by five million tons by 1995 and by 10 million tons by 2000. The cleanup burden in the first phase would fall entirely on 107 utilities burning high-sulfur coal in 20 states. But after 1995, utilities that exceed their cleanup requirements could trade credits with other utilities and with other industries. Sulfur dioxide, and nitrogen oxide _ which has its own reduction schedule _ are the main components that form an acid in the atmosphere and destroy trees and lakes thousands of miles from the emissions. Refineries and smelting plants emit these pollutants also, although certain coal-burning utilities are the main culprits.

<HEAD>Medfly Quarantine in Effect, Spraying Begins Friday</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOUNTAIN VIEW, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Agriculture officials plan to begin an air attack on the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> fruit fly Friday night, seven years after similar sprayings in the area wiped out an invasion of the voracious insects. Only 16 medflies have been found so far, but those were enough for federal and state officials Thursday to seek a quarantine of fruit from a 60-square-mile area in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clara </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, southeast of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. The quarantine from <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Palo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alto </LOCATION> is voluntary until the filing becomes official next week. Gov. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Deukmejian </PERSON> declared a state of emergency Wednesday, letting authorities spray the pesticide malathion without issuing an environmental impact report that could take months to prepare. At 9 p.m. Friday, if the weather is good, two helicopters are scheduled to begin five hours of aerial spraying in a $ 2 million battle against a bug that is capable of causing up to $ 50 million damage locally to tomatoes, apples, pears, grapes and other produce. Millions of sterile medflies will be released in 10 days in a further attempt to stop the spread of the pests. In 1980-82, the state sprayed 1,400 square miles in eight counties to wipe out a medfly infestation. That war cost $ 100 million to fight and cost <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> growers another $ 100 million in lost sales. Medflies started showing up in traps Monday, and state officials Wednesday completed a ground spraying of malathion on a 200-square-yard area around a peach tree where the larvae were breeding. Agriculture officials, who are checking 1,700 traps in an 81-square-mile area, warned residents to cover their cars and remain indoors during the aerial spraying on trees and lawns. The quarantine, the officials said, is necessary to prevent widespread infestation. `` It has to be emphasized that the reason the quarantine kept expanding last time is people kept ignoring our warnings about moving fruit out of that zone,'' said <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Wassenhove </PERSON>, the county agricultural commissioner. Statewide agriculture is a $ 16 billion per year industry. Last year, <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clara </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>'s agricultural production was worth $ 142.5 million, with $ 94.3 million of the total in fruits, nuts, vegetables and nursery crops that are among the 250 crops that the medfly devours. <PERSON> Gera </PERSON> <PERSON> Curry </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION>, said harvesters, truckers, processors and sales people also would be hurt by a medfly infestation because every $ 1 in agricultural sales produces $ 3 in the general economy.

 The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday approved its own version of a bill to help low-income parents with their child care costs, providing the bulk of the aid by raising existing tax credits and entitlements. On a voice vote, the tax-writing panel rejected a competing version by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> that would establish a new program of direct child care subsidies to middle-as well as low-income families. With the legislation a key priority for members of both parties, the chief <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> sponsors of the competing versions said they hoped to reach a compromise and avoid a politically damaging fight on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> floor. `` We're not that far apart; we want to avoid Democrats fighting Democrats,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Downey </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, chief author of the Ways and Means version that, because of its reliance primarily on tax credits, is more agreeable to Republicans and the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration. With the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> having approved a shotgun marriage of the two approaches in June, <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, D-Wash., has said he hopes to bring the legislation to the floor for a vote before the end of September The Ways and Means panel's voice vote Thursday was a virtual repeat of the same stand in took in July. However, the committee amended its proposal to begin raising the existing child care subsidies that the federal government finances through block entitlement grants to states by $ 200 million in 1990 rather than in 1991. Those entitlements _ meaning the money does not have to be appropriated for them every year _ are designated for a wide variety of programs to aid the poor and are now capped at $ 2.7 billion a year. No one knows exactly how much of that existing entitlement money is actually spent on subsidizing child care, but estimates range from $ 400 million up to slightly over $ 1 billion. Whatever the total is, the legislation envisions increasing the amount devoted to child care by $ 400 million a year by 1994. All versions of the legislation envision increasing direct federal child care subsidies by a total of $ 1.75 billion over the next five years. Included in the total are increases in the existing Head Start program for poor children ages 3 to 5 and so-called `` latch-key'' subsidies for keeping elementary schools open as care facilities after classes have ended for the day. Indirect aid through an increase in the earned income tax credit for low-income families would total some $ 11 billion under the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> bill and $ 13.5 billion in the House Ways and Means version. That credit, which is indexed to inflation, now totals a maximum of $ 910 a year for a family with an income of between $ 6,500 and $ 10,240. For every dollar of income above the $ 10,240, the credit is reduced by a dime, reducing it to zero for a family with an income of $ 19,340. The income threshholds for elibility also are raised every year by the rate of consumer price inflation. In 1991, the first year that the new child care tax credit would take effect, the maximum _ instead of the projected $ 1,002 _ would rise to $ 1,217 for families with one child under the House Ways and Means version. It would rise to a maximum $ 1,504 a year for families with two children and $ 1,790 with families of three or more children.

<HEAD>Survey Says Most Favor National Health Insurance</HEAD>

 Most Americans think employers should provide health insurance for their workers, and more than half favor national health insurance, according to a survey released Thursday. But the survey conducted for the <ORGANIZATION> Employee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Benefit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> also suggests that Americans undervalue their insurance benefits, the institute said. The survey found that 80 percent of those polled believe employers should be required to provide health insurance to their full-time workers. Fifty-four percent said the federal government should insure all Americans, according to the survey. However, few would be willing to bear the full cost of benefits. About half of those without health insurance said they would be willing to pay less than $ 600 annually for coverage, while those favoring national health insurance said they would be willing to pay, on average, $ 664 per year, for that coverage. The average cost of individual coverage is $ 1,056 and for a family, $ 2,700, according to the institute. `` Everybody is desperately searching for a silver spoon,'' said <PERSON> Dallas </PERSON> <PERSON> Salisbury </PERSON>, president of the private, nonprofit, nonpartisan public policy research organization. <PERSON> Salisbury </PERSON> said the survey results show that most Americans do n't know what health insurance costs, and that most workers who are insured through their employer do not consider these benefits to be part of their compensation Seven out of eight of those surveyed opposed taxing health insurance benefits received from employers. But of the bulk who favored requiring employers to provide health insurance, 73 percent said they would still back that requirement even if benefits were taxed. The survey also asked whether respondents would rather have cash that would be taxed or the equivalent amount in health insurance benefits that would be taxed. When the amount was $ 1,000, 53 percent opted for health insurance benefits and 40 percent for cash. When the amount was $ 2,000, 49 percent took health insurance and 44 percent went for cash. Of the 1,000 adults surveyed by telephone during the last week in June, nine out of 10 said they had health insurance. Of the 10 percent who did not, more than one-third said it was because they could n't afford it, 14 percent said they were between jobs and 10 percent said they saw no need for it. The survey was conducted by the <ORGANIZATION> Gallup </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The margin of error was plus or minus 3 percentage points.

<HEAD>Toxic Waste Cleanup by US Superfund Is `Superslow,' Rand Corp. Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LEE SIEGEL</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
 The federal Superfund program has been `` superslow'' in cleaning toxic waste dumps and in making polluters pay for the work, according to a study. In the program's first eight years ending last September, the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> finished cleaning only 34 dumps out of 1,175 on a priority list, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Rand </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> study, to be released Friday. The list represents only the worst of 30,000 dumps where waste ultimately may need to be treated or removed. The report also found that <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> spent only $ 2.6 billion of the $ 4.5 billion in Superfund money from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> during 1980-1988, and only $ 1.6 billion went directly to cleanup work, with the rest spent on management and legal costs. Finally, the agency recovered only $ 230 million of the $ 2.6 billion from polluters who are supposed to pay for the cleanup work, said the study by <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Acton </PERSON>, of Rand's <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION>. `` Superfund has been superslow at cleaning up toxic waste sites, spending available funds and recovering its outlays from those who did the polluting,'' the non-profit, <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Monica-based </LOCATION> think tank said in a statement summarizing <PERSON> Acton </PERSON>'s findings. Other studies have criticized Superfund's pace, but Rand's is `` a very good attempt'' to statistically measure progress in cleaning dump sites, said <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Kovalick </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s deputy director of Superfund. After he was appointed by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> Administrator <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> ordered an internal review that criticized Superfund. <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> pledged in June to toughen toxic waste cleanup enforcement. <PERSON> Kovalick </PERSON> said that despite problems, the cleanup effort is n't as bad as Rand's study suggests. While only 34 dumps had been declared clean by September 1988, <PERSON> Kovalick </PERSON> said cleanup is under way on another 170. Designs for waste isolation or treatment facilities or other cleanup work are in progress at another 230 dumps. Studies of the extent of contamination and cleanup options are under way for more than 640 other waste sites, <PERSON> Kovalick </PERSON> said. The $ 2.6 billion actually spent does n't include formal <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> obligations to pay for work now under way, <PERSON> Kovalick </PERSON> said. Only a fraction of cleanup costs has been recovered from polluters because `` it's hard to recover the money until you've finished the -LRB- cleanup -RRB- project.'' `` We think improvements are possible, but substantial progress has been made,'' <PERSON> Kovalick </PERSON> said by telephone from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Rand blamed cleanup delays partly on <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> sluggishness under ex-President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> _ when Superfund official <PERSON> Rita </PERSON> <PERSON> Lavelle </PERSON> went to prison for perjured testimony to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> _ and on high staff turnover, confused management, failure to learn from experience and other `` inefficiencies'' at the agency. But the study also suggested the cleanup effort is lagging due to court battles that occur because the Superfund law requires the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> to make polluters perform or pay for the cleanup work whenever possible. If companies responsible for pollution ca n't be identified or no longer exist, then the Superfund trust fund pays for the cleanup. <PERSON> Acton </PERSON> said that when the law comes before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for reauthorization in 1991, lawmakers may want to ask: `` Is it more important to clean up the sites -LRB- faster -RRB- or is it more important to shift the financial burden to private parties?'' Under the current law, he said, `` We seem to be getting some of the worst of both worlds: We set up an adversarial system so it -LRB- cleanup work -RRB- goes slower, but then we're not recovering very much in the way of costs.'' But <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Greer </PERSON>, technical director of the <ORGANIZATION> Hazardous </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Waste </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treatment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, which represents companies that do cleanup work, said `` there's no reason for the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> taxpayer to pay for industrial dumping'' if the polluting companies can be tracked down. The <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> also believes `` the polluters should pay,'' although many other polluters have fought to shift the cost to taxpayers, spokesman <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilroy </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Greer </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lois </PERSON> <PERSON> Epstein </PERSON>, an engineer with the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION>, blamed Superfund's laggard pace on weak enforcement by the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> during the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> years and foot-dragging by polluters trying to escape financial responsibility. `` We're optimistic that <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> is ready to improve the program,'' <PERSON> Epstein </PERSON> said. The Rand study said <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> may recover another $ 824 million in cleanup costs spent through September 1988, and also has signed agreements with polluters who plan to clean their own dump sites with work valued at more than $ 1 billion. <PERSON> Acton </PERSON> acknowledged his study does n't take into account voluntary cleanups performed by polluters fearful of being forced into more costly solutions by the EPA.

<HEAD>Congressional Witness Links Organized Crime to Penny Stock Fraud</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An admitted penny stock scam artist, wearing a hood to conceal his identity, told a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee Thursday that penny stocks traded over-the-counter are often controlled by organized crime. <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> <PERSON> Formato </PERSON>, a former broker and promotor of the inexpensive but highly risky securities known as penny stocks, testified that `` organized crime has their hand on the shoulder of someone inside any -LRB- over-the-counter -RRB- brokerage that's making money.'' Formato is now in the federal Witness Protection Program. He told the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on telecommunications and finance that although there are legitimate companies offering their stocks over-the-counter they are often manipulated by brokers, promoters or salesmen. Although their price _ a few cents up to a few dollars a share _ makes penny stocks attractive to small investors with limited funds, many are prone to abuse because information about the issuing company often is hard to obtain and fraudulent claims are difficult to dispute. Small or young companies, or those that trade infrequently or in a limited area, are often listed only on so-called `` pink sheets'' rather than with larger and more stable companies. Brokers and investors must call a broker that deals in a specific company's shares to get a price quote According to a survey by state securities regulators, American investors have been cheated out of at least $ 2 billion a year by crooked schemes involving penny stocks. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dealers </ORGANIZATION>, a self-regulating organization that oversees over-the-counter stock brokers, said any investigation of organized crime links to the industry was in government hands. `` We're cracking down hard on unscrupulous penny stock brokers, but we're not <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON> <PERSON> Ness </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferri </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> NASD </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. `` If an investigation has to go farther than our purview, the law enforcement agency we're dealing with will take it from there. And that's quite often the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> or the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>.'' `` Penny stock swindles are now the No. 1 threat of fraud and abuse facing small mom-and-pop investors in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Markey </PERSON>, D-Mass., the subcommittee chairman He called Formato's testimony `` a blistering, scalding indictment of the entire penny stock market.'' <PERSON> Formato </PERSON> entered the crowded congressional hearing room surrounded by federal marshals and wearing a gray hood with holes for his mouth, nose and eyes. He testified from behind a screen with his voice altered deliberately to protect his identity. He said he got involved with the mob in his native <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> to prevent competitors from trying to undercut him. `` I needed the protection. I needed the strength of organized crime,'' he said. But <PERSON> Formato </PERSON>, who is serving a six-year prison sentence incognito, declined to say what organized crime family he was involved with. He pleaded guilty in 1987 to charges of income tax evasion, mail fraud and interstate transportation of money taken in stock fraud, according to <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Warren </PERSON>, a federal prosecutor in <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, <PERSON> N.J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Formato </PERSON> was the government's key witness at the trial of five people later convicted of participating in a penny stock fraud involving a bogus company, <ORGANIZATION> Laser </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arms </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, that purported to have developed a self-chilling beverage can. <PERSON> Formato </PERSON> was described at the trial as one of the masterminds behind the scam. In addition to the five convicted at trial, nine other people pleaded guilty to charges involving Laser Arms. Formato gave several recommendations for cleaning up the penny stock market, especially tougher penalties. He said he used to laugh at the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, the watchdog of the stocks and bonds markets, because it did not have the authority to put him behind bars. `` I did not fear the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Formato </PERSON> said. `` They could only attack me on a civil basis. The people who bought the stocks lost their money.'' `` There are thousands of people making millions of dollars doing what he did,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Baldwin </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Division </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Baldwin </PERSON> is also president of the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administrators </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, a Washington-based organization of state securities regulators. `` The evidence is clear and convincing: <LOCATION> Penny </LOCATION> stock fraud has evolved into a problem of truly national proportions,'' said <PERSON> Baldwin </PERSON>. A report on <ORGANIZATION> NASAA </ORGANIZATION>'s 50-state survey of securities regulators noted that investors in legitimate penny stocks `` are believed to lose all or some of their investment 70 percent of the time and the presence of fraud pushes up that figure to 90 percent.'' The <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> has created a <ORGANIZATION> Penny </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> and has adopted rules that will make tougher to sell penny stocks over the telephone.

<TEXT>
 The state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday rejected an appeal by <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Corona </PERSON>, the farm labor contractor convicted of murdering 25 farm workers in 1971. The justices unanimously denied a hearing on <PERSON> Corona </PERSON>'s challenge to a lower-court ruling upholding his convictions. He was sentenced to 25 years to life for each of the murders. The bodies, most of them stabbed or hacked to death, were found in shallow graves in orchards in the <LOCATION> Marysville-Yuba </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> area. Defense lawyers denied <PERSON> Corona </PERSON>'s guilt and blamed the murders on a half-brother, now dead. <PERSON> Corona </PERSON>'s first convictions were overturned on appeal because of a finding that his lawyer had acted incompetently and had a conflict of interest. <PERSON> Corona </PERSON> was convicted again at a second trial. The 1st District Court of Appeal upheld the convictions in June despite finding that a reported confession by <PERSON> Corona </PERSON> had been admitted into evidence improperly. A Mexican consul, <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> <PERSON> Navarro </PERSON>, testified at the second trial that <PERSON> Corona </PERSON> had told him in 1978 he had killed the farm workers because he was a `` sick man.'' Under an international agreement, consular officials can not be required to testify about matters related to their official duties unless their government issues a written waiver. The Mexican government did not try to stop <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> from testifying but did not furnish a written waiver. The appeals court said <ORGANIZATION> Colusa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Patton </PERSON>, who presided over the retrial, should have excluded <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>'s testimony and was wrong in deciding that the consul was authorized to waive the privilege of confidentiality on his own. But the court, in an opinion by Justice <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Corona </PERSON>'s rights were not violated because the right of confidentiality was held legally by the <LOCATION> Mexican </LOCATION> government, not <PERSON> Corona </PERSON>. As a result, <PERSON> King </PERSON> said, the defense can not complain that violation of that right deprived <PERSON> Corona </PERSON> of a fair trial. `` We are fully satisfied that <PERSON> Corona </PERSON>'s second trial was fair and that, ultimately, justice has been accomplished for both <PERSON> Corona </PERSON> and the people of this state,'' <PERSON> King </PERSON> said. In seeking state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> review, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Mendelsohn </PERSON>, a lawyer for <PERSON> Corona </PERSON>, said Hispanics were not represented adequately on the grand jury that indicted <PERSON> Corona </PERSON>. <PERSON> Mendelsohn </PERSON> challenged the appeals court's conclusion that <PERSON> Corona </PERSON> was required to show that the lack of Hispanics had harmed his case.

 Here are excerpts from a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> statement Thursday on the investigation into the April 19 explosion aboard the USS Iowa and from the unclassified version of the endorsement of the investigation by the chief of naval operations, Adm. <PERSON> Carlisle </PERSON> <PERSON> A.H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Trost </PERSON>. First from the statement: The tragic loss of 47 personnel within turret II and associated ammunition handling rooms precluded a precise causal determination, since the personnel most knowledgeable of actions and intentions were those who lost their lives. After an examination of all available evidence and extensive tests, the investigation concluded that the explosion was most probably caused by an intentional act. The weight of evidence indicates that some type of detonation device was deliberately placed between the powder bags being rammed into the breech of the center gun. The most likely person with the access, knowledge and possible motivation to accomplish this act has been identified as Gunner's Mate 2nd Class <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> USN </ORGANIZATION>, the center gun captain in turret II at the time of the explosion. The investigation resulted in a complete review of all aspects of gunnery operations on board USS Iowa. The investigating officer found deficiencies in training documentation, ordnance handling requirements and safety procedures; however, exhaustive tests and duplication of the type of blast that occurred conclusively demonstrated that these shortcomings did not cause the explosion.

<TEXT>
 From Adm. <PERSON> Trost </PERSON>'s endorsement of the investigation: On 19 April 1989 a rapid series of three explosions within turret II aboard USS Iowa resulted in the instantaneous deaths of 47 <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> sailors. A Judge Advocate General's Manual investigation was convened immediately. Every conceivable source of ignition and every aspect of <LOCATION> USS </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>'s condition and shipboard routine that might have bearing on the incident were evaluated: routine, procedures, training, safety, manning and personal conduct. Since the primary explosion was determined to have occurred within the center gun room the focus of the investigation was properly directed to that location. The tragic loss of personnel within turret II and adjacent ammunition handling spaces precluded a precise causal determination since the personnel most knowledgeable of actions and intentions were those who lost their lives. ... The initial explosion was caused by premature ignition of five bags of smokeless powder contained within the center gun with the breech open. The point of ignition was most probably between the first and second bags. Exhaustive technical tests have ruled out the following possibilities which constitute the most logical inadvertent causes: burning ember, premature primer firing, mechanical failure, friction, electromagnetic spark, propellant instability and personnel procedural error. Although deficiencies in training documentation, weapons handling procedures, and adherence to safety procedures were found within the weapons department, the exhaustive tests and duplication of the type of blast that occurred have conclusively demonstrated that these shortcomings did not cause the explosion. ... The thought of an intentional, wrongful act is repugnant to all professional seagoing men and women; however, this consideration had to be pursued when information surfaced that introduced its possibility. Extensive laboratory tests using optical and electronic microscopy revealed the existence of foreign elements not normally present in the 16-inch guncharge. An attempt by separate <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> analysis to correlate these elements with material associated with an improvised explosive device proved inconclusive. ... Additional hard factual evidence such as the position of the ... rammer and the subsequent delay in retracting the rammer to allow closing of the breech provides credibility to the theory that an intentional human act caused the ignition of the powder charge. The critical controlling station within turret II to allow the aforementioned factors to occur was that of the center gun captain. These factors, when combined with circumstantial evidence associated with the individual manning that gun captain position at the time of the explosion, strongly suggest that an intentional human act most probably caused the premature ignition. ... The evidence amassed includes: -LRB- 1 -RRB- irrefutable facts on condition in the center gun room at the instant of the explosion, such as the position of the rammer, -LRB- 2 -RRB- the fact GMG2 <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON> was in the gun captain position, and -LRB- 3 -RRB- significant circumstantial evidence documenting the lifestyle and thought patterns of GMG2 <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON> over a lengthy period of time. The combination of these factors leads me reluctantly to the conclusion that the most likely cause of the explosion was a detonation device, deliberately introduced between powder bags that were being rammed into the breech of the center gun. This caused premature detonation and the subsequent disastrous explosions aboard USS Iowa on 19 April, 1989, resulting in the deaths of 47 sailors, including <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON>. I further concur with the investigating officer and the subsequent endorsers that the preponderance of evidence supports the theory that the most likely person to have introduced the detonation device was GMG2 <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON>.

 A <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committee agreed Thursday to permanently prohibit cigarette smoking on all domestic airline flights, expanding the current ban on smoking on trips of two hours or less. The restrictions were included in an $ 11.9 billion spending bill for fiscal 1990 transportation programs that the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appropriations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> adopted by a 17-0 vote. The measure is expected to reach the full <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> next week. `` It's time to get on with protecting public health and safety, and this is one way to make certain that happens,'' said the sponsor of the restrictions, Sen. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lautenberg </PERSON>, D-N.J. By 18-11, the lawmakers rejected an attempt by Sen. <PERSON> Thad </PERSON> <PERSON> Cochran </PERSON>, R-Miss., to water down the proposal by making permanent the current ban on smoking on flights of two hours or less The issue, as usual, cut across party lines: Democrats on the panel opposed <PERSON> Cochran </PERSON> by an 11-5 margin, while Republicans did the same, 7-6. The committee also rejected 15-8 an amendment by Sen. <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Hollings </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-S.C. </LOCATION>, that would have forbidden both smoking and alcohol drinking aboard airliners. Current restrictions, which will otherwise expire next April, cover 80 percent of all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airline routes. <PERSON> Lautenberg </PERSON>'s proposal would take effect 90 days after the bill becomes law, and would supersede the current prohibition if enacted before April. <ORGANIZATION> House-Senate </ORGANIZATION> negotiators must now work out compromise language before sending the measure to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for his signature. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> voted Aug. 3 to make the current prohibition permanent. The vote spelled yet another defeat for the tobacco industry and edged health groups and airline employee unions a step closer toward their latest victory. Supporters of the ban argue that with the recirculated air of airline cabins, non-smoking passengers face the risk of lung cancer and other diseases by breathing cigarette smoke. Opponents have claimed that health hazards from the fumes are unproven, and that the ban hurts people who rely on cigarette sales for their jobs. `` The previous system of separating smokers from non-smokers worked and made the vast majority of people happy,'' said <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> <PERSON> Dawson </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, the trade group for most of the nation's cigarette manufacturers. The industry pocketed $ 35 billion in sales last year. As under current law, <PERSON> Lautenberg </PERSON>'s extension would levy fines of up to $ 1,000 for passengers caught smoking and up to $ 2,000 for people found to have disconnected smoke detectors in aircraft restrooms. Lavatories are considered the most dangerous spot for a fire on an airliner because of the paper stored there, but they also tend to attract smokers trying to light up in secret. <PERSON> Cigar </PERSON> and pipe smoking has been prohibited aboard airliners since 1983. <PERSON> Lautenberg </PERSON> and Rep. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Durbin </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ill </LOCATION>., were sponsors of the current smoking ban, which was enacted in 1987 The spending bill would provide $ 7.3 billion for aviation programs, $ 3 billion for the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>, $ 12.2 billion for highway spending, $ 3 billion for mass transit assistance, and $ 615 million for <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION>, the Northeast passenger railroad. Besides the $ 11.9 billion in new spending, the measure would also allow $ 15.9 billion to be spent from money the government has collected from various fuel and airline passenger taxes. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration proposed spending $ 10 billion for transportation in fiscal 1990, which begins Oct. 1, with lower spending for mass transit, higher spending for aviation, and no assistance for <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> measure includes: _ $ 35.5 million for subsidies paid to airlines that serve small communities. The House version of the bill would provide $ 12.4 million. _ $ 1.2 million for a commission on aviation terrorism that President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> created last month _ A requirement that the <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> study what legal changes would be needed to allow the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> to fire on suspected drug smugglers As usual with spending bills, the measure contained funds for projects in the home states of members of the subcommittee. Thus, it bore $ 500,000 for <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> state officials to work on blocking drug trafficking on interstate highways in <PERSON> Lautenberg </PERSON>'s home state There was another $ 20 million to complete a state highway near <LOCATION> Corning </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, represented by Sen. <PERSON> Alfonse </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, ranking Republican on the panel.

 <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON> resigned Thursday after his guilty plea to a felony charge was disclosed in federal court, becoming <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>'s latest state official to leave in disgrace this summer. Earlier Thursday, a defense lawyer told U.S. District Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Copenhaver </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> that <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON> has agreed to plead guilty to extortion on a charge that he accepted $ 10,000 from racetrack officials seeking favorable legislation. `` I just made a stupid mistake,'' he told WSAZ-TV in <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>. The announcement came just before opening arguments in the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> trial of <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON>'s predecessor as senate president, <ORGANIZATION> Marshall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrat </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Tonkovich </PERSON>. <PERSON> Tonkovich </PERSON> is charged with three counts of extortion, two counts of attempted extortion and one count of racketeering. <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON>, also a Democrat, is listed as a defense witness for <PERSON> Tonkovich </PERSON>, who is accused of soliciting money from groups that had legislation pending before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Tonkovich </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Lees </PERSON>, told <PERSON> Copenhaver </PERSON> he was unaware of <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON> signing an agreement to plead guilty when he placed the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> president on his list of defense witnesses. Among other <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> Democratic officials who have resigned or pleaded guilty this summer are Attorney General <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, who resigned as part of an agreement in which a grand jury investigation of him was halted; state Treasurer <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Manchin </PERSON>, who resigned to halt his removal trial in the state <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> on 17 impeachment counts; and state Sen. <PERSON> Si </PERSON> <PERSON> Boettner </PERSON>, who pleaded guilty to a felony income tax charge and resigned. <PERSON> Tonkovich </PERSON>'s former top aide, <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Cain </PERSON>, recently pleaded guilty to a federal tax charge. Federal prosecutors had previously filed documents alleging that <PERSON> Tonkovich </PERSON> supported legislation in 1987 favorable to Tri-State Greyhound Park in Cross Lanes in exchange for $ 10,000 from track co-owner <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON>. At the time, <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON> was <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> chairman and <PERSON> Tonkovich </PERSON> was <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> president. <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON> could not be reached for comment Thursday, but he previously denied any wrongdoing. <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON>, 54, told <ORGANIZATION> WSAZ </ORGANIZATION> he accepted $ 10,000 from race track lobbyist <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Annunzio </PERSON>, then unsuccessfully tried to return it to him. He said <PERSON> D'Annunzio </PERSON> refused to accept the money. <PERSON> D'Annunzio </PERSON> eventually cooperated with federal prosecutors in their investigation of the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION>, and he committed suicide in December 1988. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Clerk <PERSON> Darrell </PERSON> <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> said <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON> submitted a one-sentence letter of resignation Thursday afternoon. <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON>, a two-term senator, was elected president in 1989 after <PERSON> Tonkovich </PERSON> gave up his <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> seat for an unsuccessful campaign for the Democratic nomination for governor. Under legislative rules, <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Pro-Tem </PERSON> <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitlow </PERSON> will serve as acting president until a replacement is elected by the full <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Government Claims It Repulsed Attack on Khost</HEAD>

<DATELINE>KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government today claimed troops battling U.S.-backed Moslem rebels had regained control over areas surrounding the eastern border city of <LOCATION> Khost </LOCATION> after two weeks of heavy fighting. `` The battle is completely over,'' Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Ulumi </PERSON>, secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, told a news conference in the Afghan capital. There was no immediate confirmation or denial of his claim. <PERSON> Ulumi </PERSON> said at least 3,500 mujahedeen rebels had attacked the city, just 10 miles from the border with <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, where most of the rebels are based. He claimed 1,000 rebels were killed and 1,000 wounded in the fighting. A rebel victory at <LOCATION> Khost </LOCATION> would have opened a direct rebel supply link from <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> to fighters in northern and western <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. Convoys supplied at depots in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> are now forced to take long routes around <LOCATION> Khost </LOCATION> to reach upper <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, where the countryside is largely controlled by the rebels. <PERSON> Ulumi </PERSON> said the fighting ended after government forces recently took back two military posts at <LOCATION> Tani </LOCATION>, 10 miles south of the city. He would not confirm when, but government sources said the posts were retaken in fighting overnight Wednesday. `` We are back in the positions we were in around <LOCATION> Khost </LOCATION>'' when the attack was launched Aug. 24, <PERSON> Ulumi </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Ulumi </PERSON> told the mujahedeen, who have not had a significant military victory since the Soviet troops withdrew from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in February after nine years of fighting, that it was futile to continue trying to capture the country. `` Those who imagine they can capture <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> will only take their coffins with them back to <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>,'' he said. The mujahedeen have previously launched attacks on <LOCATION> Kandahar </LOCATION>, the country's second-largest city, and <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>, a strategically vital town east of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. Both attacks have bogged down, reflecting the rebels' inability to switch from their previously successful guerrilla tactics to more conventional warfare. <PERSON> Ulumi </PERSON> also said the Afghan air force had acquired Soviet MiG-29 jet fighters and Sukhoy-27 interceptors but had not used the planes in combat. The battle of attrition between both sides has usually been confined to ground fighting, although the government has been using airplanes and helicopter gunships to strafe rebel positions.

<HEAD>UAW, Auto Industry Criticize Proposed Efficiency Standards</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A proposal to strengthen automobile fuel-efficiency requirements is unrealistic and could lead the industry to compromise safety and cut its work force, labor and industry leaders said Thursday. But supporters said the bill was needed to reverse trends toward <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> reliance on foreign oil and global warming. They accused the industry of exaggerating the difficulty of meeting the proposed standards and their economic impact. `` Your predecessors ... in effect forecast the collapse of Western civilization as we know it in 1974'' when they lobbied against the original Corporate Average Fuel Economy law, Sen. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Nev </LOCATION>., told industry representatives at a hearing of the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>, Science and Technology consumer subcommittee `` Why should I believe you based upon your previous testimony?'' asked <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON>, chairman of the subcommittee. <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> wants to require a 20 percent improvement in fuel efficiency from the current fleet average by 1995 and a 40 percent improvement by 2000. The current law requires each manufacturer's fleet of new cars and light trucks sold in the <LOCATION> Unites </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> average at least 27.5 miles per gallon. For <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION>, the <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> bill would require a minimum of 33 mpg in 1995 and 40 mpg by 2000, said <PERSON> Marina </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitman </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> vice president. Strengthening the law this year would be especially burdensome for the industry, which already faces higher costs should <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> approve President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s demand for lower emissions of nitrogen oxides, Ms. <PERSON> Whitman </PERSON> said. Various federal laws and regulations are requiring air bags, larger air conditioners and anti-lock brakes, adding still more costs, she said. The law `` fails because the law pressures producers to build still more fuel-efficient vehicles without creating incentives for consumers to buy them,'' she said. Foreign-car manufacturers complained the <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> proposal would punish those who have exceeded the 1974 law's requirements by forcing them to improve efficiency by the same proportion as those who have not. `` Not only will this reduce competition among companies to improve fuel economy, but it will prevent consumers from having a price-competitive range of products from which to choose,'' said <PERSON> Hal </PERSON> <PERSON> Bracken </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> vice president. <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> <PERSON> Bieber </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION>, told the panel that cars probably would become more fuel-efficient but that specific targets should not be a matter of law. <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> said his bill would save the country 49.1 billion gallons of fuel and would reduce carbon dioxide emissions by 483 million tons between 1995 and 2001. `` While we no longer wait anxiously as <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> meets in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> ... <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is becoming more dependent on imported oil,'' he said. Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, D-Tenn., is pushing a separate idea to levy a fee on auto emissions and granting a rebate to owners of fuel-efficient vehicles

 Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said Thursday he is concerned about `` a few voices'' in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> that question the legality of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s western border. The Polish union leader and Nobel Peace laureate, delivering a speech in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> before about 1,000 people, also pleaded anew for major Western investment to help stave off the collapse of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s battered economy In <LOCATION> Duesseldorf </LOCATION> earlier Thursday, <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> welcomed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> proposals to aid <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, but said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> should do far more. <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s new Solidarity-led government is struggling to revive the country's economy, weighed down by inefficient state companies, shortages of goods and a $ 39 billion foreign debt. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> stressed that without major economic investment, reform could be in jeopardy not only in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> but elsewhere in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. He said Poles are ready to make sacrifices to attract Western business investment. He also addressed efforts by <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> to forge closer ties. Bitter feelings linger in both countries stemming from <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s invasion of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> 50 years ago, the start of World War II. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, on the third day of a four-day visit, said he is optimistic about intensifying West German-Polish relations. But he said the `` first basis'' for that is the `` inviolability of our borders.'' `` We are concerned about a few voices in the Federal Republic relating to the allegedly open question about the -LRB- western -RRB- border,'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said. `` It would be useful, if this topic were no longer present in the bilateral relations.'' He called such discussion a waste of time. Finance Minister <PERSON> Theodor </PERSON> <PERSON> Waigel </PERSON> and some other archconservative West German politicians have suggested former German lands now in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> technically still belong to <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> because a peace treaty was never signed establishing the border. Resentment continues among many West Germans about the forced removal of millions of Germans from the now-Polish lands after World War II. But West German Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> reassured <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> this country makes no claim to the lands and abides by the 1970 West German-Polish treaty in which both countries pledged to respect existing borders. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said he is not comforted when archconservatives in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> say they are only pointing out a legal technicality. `` If it is possible to interpret the situation in two different ways, then perhaps the situation should be changed,'' he said. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> also said he was concerned by resentment among some West Germans about ethnic Germans who came here from <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and other <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc nations seeking better living conditions. A rise in ultraright sentiment in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> has been at least partly attributed to an increasing wave of refugees. `` This emigration problem ... activates a wave of intolerance and provokes nationalistic feelings. People, we must take charge and find humanitarian solutions!'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> met with <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> on Thursday and called for a new beginning in Polish-West German relations, calling this especially important on the 50th anniversary of the start of World War II. In <LOCATION> Duesseldorf </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> was asked about proposed legislation in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> that would provide aid of up to $ 300 million a year and ease <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s foreign debt burden. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has already proposed $ 100 million in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> assistance to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. Although asked about the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> initiative, <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> instead referred to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposal, saying, `` What <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did is in the right direction.'' `` This is not enough for the improvement of living conditions in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. It should be seen as having symbolic value, it should show people the way, it should animate people.'' <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> asked again that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and other Western nations invest $ 10 billion in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>.

 The former chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> committee that investigated the Iran-Contra scandal said Thursday that so many questions remain about the role of President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and others that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> should not yet close the books on the affair. Rep. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>, D-Ind., asked that the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> begin `` a continuing investigation'' of new documents and other evidence that have surfaced in the trial of former Marine Lt.

He asked that as part of its continuing probe, the Intelligence panel ask the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> White House to undertake a comprehensive search of all relevant <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration files, including the `` heads of state'' file recently discovered at the Reagan Library in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. `` It is possible that other important documents were missed by have not yet come to light,'' <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> wrote.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is conducting at least four investigations of possible security and conflict-of-interest problems at an Energy Department laboratory that performs top-secret nuclear weapons work, congressional sources said Thursday. The newest probe, launched in July by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> oversight and investigations subcommittee, focuses on the terms under which the <ORGANIZATION> Lawrence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Livermore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> transferred a new computer technology to a company led by former lab scientists who had helped develop the technology. Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON>, D-Mich., chairman of the subcommittee, has raised ethics questions about the deal, although lab and company officials deny any wrongdoing Congressional sources involved in the probes disclosed Thursday that lab officials also are under investigation for allegedly `` failing to protect important security assets'' at the site, near <LOCATION> Livermore </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>. The sources, who spoke on the condition they not be identified, declined to reveal details of the security lapse but said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tuck </PERSON>, the energy undersecretary, acknowledged in a closed hearing in July that the problem posed an unacceptable risk to national security. Immediate corrective actions were promised, they said. A reporter's telephone call to Tuck was not returned. Plutonium and other sensitive materials are used at <LOCATION> Lawrence </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Livermore </LOCATION> in nuclear weapons design and research activities. The lab, one of three major weapons design facilities, is operated by the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> under an <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> contract. The <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON> subcommittee also is investigating the national security implications of an allegation by <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Woodruff </PERSON>, formerly a leader of the lab's weapons program. <PERSON> Woodruff </PERSON> contends he was blocked by lab superiors from writing to national security officials in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> in 1983-85 to dispute optimistic projections by physicist <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Teller </PERSON> about the X-ray laser weapon being developed there. The X-ray laser uses the energy of a nuclear explosion in space to destroy enemy rocket boosters. Separately, the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, the investigative arm of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, is probing allegations of thefts of government property at the lab. This probe was launched last year after <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON>'s panel was told in a public hearing that some lab employees had sold computers and other government assets for drug money. The lab in 1986 launched its own investigation of drug trafficking by employees after a number of workers became involved in drug-related incidents and arrests. <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON> later accused the Energy Department of pressuring the investigators to drop the matter just days before they were to enter the highest-security sections of the lab. <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON> stepped up pressure on Energy Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> to review the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>'s management of <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Livermore </PERSON> by pressing him for information about the circumstances of a licensing deal the lab made earlier this year with <ORGANIZATION> n-Chip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a Livermore-based company started by former lab scientists. The department's internal auditors also are investigating the licensing deal at the request of the department's <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> field office, which oversees the lab operations. In a July 7 letter to <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON>, a copy of which was made public on Wednesday, <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON> called the awarding of the license to n-Chip to commercially develop a technology known as laser pantography `` highly curious.'' He cited `` the appearance of a conflict of interest'' in granting an exclusive license to a company whose top officials include at least three people who helped <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Livermore </PERSON> develop the technology. Laser pantography is used for connecting computer chips in a way that permits supercomputers to be compressed to the size of a cigarette pack. In a telephone interview Thursday, <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Dauber </PERSON>, the chairman of n-Chip, said his company and the lab took special care to meet all ethical and legal requirements for the licensing deal. He called it a `` normal, usual patenting agreement.''

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> asked <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday for the downpayment on a $ 150 million aid package for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, and the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> said it might increase the amount if more economic and political reforms are adopted by those countries. For the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> requested $ 33.5 million. `` We'll always be looking for opportunties to increase that aid but we believe certain economic reforms and political reforms are necessary as a link with any real increases in aid, so we have some assurances that it is, indeed, revitalizing the Polish economy,'' said White House press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>. He said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wrote to congressional leaders and asked for rapid approval of his request. In addition to the economic aid, the administration is preparing a $ 58 million package of food aid for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> that is expected to be ready around Oct. 1. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, `` We want to get all the food aid in there we can.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> announced the $ 150 million package during his July trip to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. Some members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> have urged the administration to expand the package to reward the installation of Solidarity member <PERSON> Tadeusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON> as prime minister of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. The president discussed the package, along with other subjects, with <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> during a meeting at the White House. Senate Minority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, R-Kan., who earlier had recommended a higher figure, said, `` I think he's doing what he should do in providing the leadership, working with the Western alliance. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said `` the bottom line is ... it's primarily the responsibility of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>.'' Sen. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Domenici </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.M. </LOCATION>, said he recommended to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> that he name a task force of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> businessmen, labor leaders and others to work with <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s government to identify the reforms it should adopt `` to get from a communist economic base to a more productive base.'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the idea is being considered. In July, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he would provide <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> with $ 100 million to spur private enterprise and $ 15 million for environmental projects. <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> is to receive $ 25 million for entrepreneurial projects and $ 5 million for environmental projects. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also requested $ 5 million to promote organized labor.

 Common Cause accused the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Election </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> Thursday of falling down on its job of policing federal campaign finance laws, claiming the <ORGANIZATION> FEC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` seemingly willful refusal to act'' has encouraged illegal practices. The self-styled citizens lobby said the problems are so pervasive `` the best, albeit drastic, remedy may be to abolish the <ORGANIZATION> FEC </ORGANIZATION> altogether and to create a new election law enforcement agency.'' `` The <ORGANIZATION> FEC </ORGANIZATION> in recent years increasingly has abdicated its most basic responsibility _ to enforce the law,'' Common Cause said in a report. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Eiland </PERSON>, a spokesman for the election commission, said he was n't certain whether the agency would issue a response. Common Cause is an enduring critic of the <ORGANIZATION> FEC </ORGANIZATION> and has sued the agency frequently. The failure to enforce the federal campaign finance laws `` springs both from the structural defects <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> created in the agency and from the recalcitrance of the commissioners themselves,'' the study said. `` <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> virtually has ignored the <ORGANIZATION> FEC </ORGANIZATION>'s failure to enforce the law.'' Under laws passed after the Watergate scandals in the early 1970s, the <ORGANIZATION> FEC </ORGANIZATION> is charged with administering public funding of presidential campaigns, policing public disclosure, interpreting laws pertaining to presidential and congressional elections, investigating alleged violations and undertaking enforcement actions. Common Cause spotlighted so-called `` soft money'' practices in which contributions from corporations, labor unions and invididuals are channeled to state and political party organizations. The study said that in 1988 the presidential campaigns of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> `` together raised up to $ 50 million in soft money contributions from corporations, labor unions and individuals in donations as large as $ 100,000, money that is strictly prohibited in federal elections campaigns.'' `` Although this occurred in full public view, the <ORGANIZATION> FEC </ORGANIZATION> took no action to stop it, in spite of a federal court decision ordering the agency to issue new soft money rules.'' The study said, `` by its inaction, the <ORGANIZATION> FEC </ORGANIZATION> virtually issued an invitation to presidential campaigns to continue violating the law, an invitation which both presidential campaigns seized upon.'' Common Cause said such inaction discourages voluntary compliance with the law, encourages non-compliance `` to the point where the integrity of the presidential campaign finance system, in particular is now at risk.'' The advocacy group praised the <ORGANIZATION> FEC </ORGANIZATION> for performing well in the areas of public disclosure of campaign records and administering the distributions of public funds.

 Fourteen parties formally united Thursday to oppose the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> in the February general election. <PERSON> Gustavo </PERSON> <PERSON> Tablada </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opposition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, said the alliance would be registered Friday with the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parties </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electoral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. All parties in the alliance approved <PERSON> Violeta </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrios </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Chamorro </PERSON> as the opposition presidential candidate last Saturday, but disagreement arose over the choice of <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Godoy </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION>, for vice president. Mrs. <PERSON> Chamorro </PERSON> is publisher of <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prensa </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s only opposition newspaper. When the split over <PERSON> Godoy </PERSON> appeared to widen, four parties asked the electoral council to extend the Friday deadline for registration. All 14 parties, from conservative to Communist, signed a founding document Thursday that allows parties to withdraw and others to join. Only a unified opposition is considered to have a chance against the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> in the election, scheduled for Feb. 25. `` This is our weapon, the unity of the Nicaraguan people so that from today on our nation can once again be a republic,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Chamorro </PERSON> said after the signing at opposition headquarters. `` We hope <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> fulfills his promises of clean elections.'' President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> is expected to run as the candidate of the leftist <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, which overthrew the pro-American government of the late President <PERSON> Anastasio </PERSON> <PERSON> Somoza </PERSON> in July 1979. <PERSON> Godoy </PERSON>, labor minister in the Sandinista government from 1979 to 1984, was chosen as the opposition vice presidential candidate over businessman <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Bolanos </PERSON>. Some on the right see him as too liberal. Members of the opposition alliance are the Popular Social Christians, <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Independents </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Constitutionalists </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Socialists </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>, Social Democrats, <ORGANIZATION> Communists </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Confidence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION>, Neoliberals, National Conservatives, <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Integrationists </ORGANIZATION> and National Conservative Action. <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> has seven other small parties that are not in the alliance.

<HEAD>Bush, Quayle In Step On SDI: Fitzwater</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said Thursday there was no difference of opinion between President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> on the Strategic Defense Initiative. The spokesman also said that former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had not exaggerated the potential ability of SDI to defend against incoming nuclear missiles. The <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> published an interview with <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> on Thursday in which the vice president suggested that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had resorted to `` political jargon'' in his original, 1983 sales pitch for a multi-billion-dollar research effort aimed at creating a space-based defense shield. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, in launching his SDI initiative, `` talked about this impenetrable shield that was going to be completely leak proof.'' `` I believe that in the semantics of let's say political jargon, that that was acceptable. But it clearly was stretching the capability of a strategic defense system,'' said the vice president. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s comments reflected `` the fact that we have been able to winnow the objectives of the program to ... fit more definable kinds of objectives.'' He said there was `` no difference'' between <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> on SDI. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was `` just saying there was some strange language associated with some of the discussion of it,'' said <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>. `` But he believes in it.'' Referring to <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s `` political jargon'' phrase, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> added, `` The only thing we have different today is two inflammatory words.'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> still has not given up the goal of perfecting a space shield against all incoming nuclear missiles. `` That's kind of the goal that you keep working for,'' said <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>. The `` ultimate goal,'' he added, remains `` a space shield that protects against the intercontinental ballistic missiles.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, an early, ardent advocate of SDI, said in the interview that the on-going research effort on SDI has been `` clearly rethought,'' with emphasis on an approach called `` Brilliant Pebbles'' that would rely on clusters of mini-missiles to track and knock out incoming rockets. `` We have redefined Star Wars and put it into missions, requirements, doctrine and strategy much differently than we did in the early 1980s,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said the new emphasis could help protect the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> against an accidental launch or a limited nuclear attack `` rather than an all-out, bolt-out-of-the-blue attack'' by the Soviets. The administration's request for $ 4.9 billion for SDI research for fiscal 1990 is under attack on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, where the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> wants to cut $ 1.8 billion from the program.

 Israeli Arabs demanded an investigation Thursday of claims that a century-old Moslem graveyard was bulldozed so adjacent villas would have a better view of the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION>. `` The municipality does nothing when a graveyard is criminally desecrated and the bones of the dead are crushed by bulldozers of people who have no morals,'' said a statement released by Moslem leaders who gathered at the site near <LOCATION> Herzliya </LOCATION>, a coastal town eight miles north of <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>. Moslem clerics and three <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> members of the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> parliament said the city sent the machines to change a pipe in the graveyard, then the workers hauled away hundreds of cubic yards of earth to give the villas a better view, the newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Yediot </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ahronot </ORGANIZATION> reported. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio quoted Mayor <PERSON> Eli </PERSON> <PERSON> Landau </PERSON> as saying the bulldozers did not enter the graveyard, but that the city would investigate. It quoted him as saying the incident was an `` attempt to create friction between Arabs and Jews.'' <ORGANIZATION> Yediot </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ahronot </ORGANIZATION> quoted <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> member <PERSON> Rafi </PERSON> <PERSON> Edri </PERSON>, who owns a house in the area, as saying no graves were violated. `` If there was any desecration of a graveyard, I'd be the first to scream,'' the independent paper quoted him as saying.

 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador to <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>, said Thursday he hopes to be able to return to <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> `` as soon as the situation is calm again.'' <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> and 29 members of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy staff were evacuated from <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> Wednesday after a Christian commander in the embattled city had voiced threatening remarks. <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> spoke briefly with reporters when he arrived at <LOCATION> Dulles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> on a flight from <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. `` Any embassy has to rely on the host government authorities to provide protection,'' he said. `` When we felt that that was n't being provided any more, we had to leave.'' Asked whether the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was washing its hands of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> replied: `` Never. We're very interested in what's happening in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. We have a strong attachment to the <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> people.'' The ambassador was asked whether the evacuation of him and the embassy staff would have any impact on efforts to free Western hostages believed held in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> said that while the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> was located in <LOCATION> Christian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, the hostages are believed to be held captive in <LOCATION> Moslem </LOCATION> <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. Movements of Americans assigned to the embassy had been restricted to <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. For that reason, he said, `` our absence from <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> will unfortunately not really impact significantly on what we know about the hostages.'' The envoy was met at the airport was met by his wife, <PERSON> Marija </PERSON>, and their 11-year-old daughter, <PERSON> Julia </PERSON>. Earlier Thursday, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> renewed its allegation that a <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> commander in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> had threatened to take 20 Americans hostage. `` I view it as a threat,'' spokeswoman <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said of General <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s remark to the French newspaper <PERSON> Figaro </PERSON> that taking hostages was evidently the way to get <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attention. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> had complained in the interview that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was not paying enough attention to the war in his country between Christians and Moslems backed by <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>. In reply, Ms. <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration had taken an active role in seeking a settlement. She said President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> had called for a cease-fire and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassadors and government officials in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> were working toward that end. `` I think we have been engaged,'' Ms. <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Family, Sailors Dispute Navy Finding</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Iowa Inquiry, Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s conclusion that a gunner's mate probably caused a deadly explosion on the battleship USS <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> was met Thursday with harsh criticism from his family and skepticism from other sailors. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> `` has concocted this fable ... in an attempt to shift the blame away from its dismal track record in their operation of this battleship and lay the blame on a dead sailor who is n't here to defend himself,'' said <PERSON> Kreig </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brusnahan </PERSON>, an attorney for the family of <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON>. In a report released at the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON> probably placed a detonator between gunpowder bags in one of the battleship's 16-inch guns. The April 19 blast killed 47 sailors including <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON>, who was the gun captain, or supervisor of loading the weapon and with its World War II-vintage ammuntion. `` The idea that one man blew up 47 others, I do n't find it feasible. I think it was somehow an accident,'' said a petty officer second class at the USS Iowa's home port, <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va </LOCATION>. He declined to give his name. `` If the man wanted to commit suicide, there are a lot of other ways to do it, without taking 47 of your crewmates with you.'' Retired Rear Adm. <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON>, deputy director of the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, called the finding `` a very, very far-reaching grasping at straws.'' He said the report criticized the equipment maintenance and crew training but did not blame those factors for the explosion. `` This probable cause diverts attention from the question of the performance of the equipment and the personnel,'' he said. Others defended the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s investigation. `` I do n't think it's a cop-out,'' said electrician's mate 3rd Class <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Glass </PERSON>, who is stationed aboard the amphibious cargo ship <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION>. `` I would say the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investigative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> has probably done their homework. They probably know for a fact, or have enough evidence, circumstantial or not, to back up this theory,'' said <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Haight </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION>, who retired from the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> after 20 years, most in intelligence. The report on the explosion was delivered to the ship Wednesday during a port call in <LOCATION> Gaeta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, said Capt. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanley </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fleet </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. The <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> left <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION> in June for six months in the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>. A criminal investigation of the explosion was launched after <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON>'s sister, <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kubicina </PERSON>, disclosed the existence of a $ 100,000 accidental death and dismemberment policy on her brother's life, naming gunner's mate 3rd class <PERSON> Kendall </PERSON> <PERSON> Truitt </PERSON> as a beneficiary At a news conference in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Truitt </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON>, dismissed the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s version of the explosion, which he said is `` nothing more than speculation. `` Our information was that it was the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s negligence, untrained and unqualified crew members and 50-year old technology, dangerous from day one,'' said <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON>. <PERSON> Truitt </PERSON> had expected to attend the news conference, but was ordered to remain at the <LOCATION> Mayport </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Naval </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Station </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, until too late to catch a flight for <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Harwig </PERSON>'s family in <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> was briefed on the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> report by a three-member <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> contingent on Thursday. <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON>'s father, <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> veteran, said he was unconvinced that his son or any other crew member had caused the explosion. `` I think there was a powder explosion _ accidental,'' <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON> said. `` I've never believed it right from the start,'' Ms. <PERSON> Kubicina </PERSON> said when asked if she thought her brother had caused the blast. Ms. <PERSON> Kubicina </PERSON> and her father said they wanted a congressional investigation into the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s handling of the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> probe. Ms. <PERSON> Kubicina </PERSON> also said the family is planning a defamation lawsuit against the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>.

<TEXT>
 Residents vote Saturday on three proposed changes to state government in a special election that could serve as a referendum on Gov. <PERSON> Gaston </PERSON> <PERSON> Capterton </PERSON>'s first eight months in office. <PERSON> Caperton </PERSON>, a Democrat, could win broad, new powers if two of the measures pass. One amendment eliminates three statewide elected offices _ secretary of <ORGANIZATION> state </ORGANIZATION>, treasurer and agriculture commissioner _ and places their duties under the governor's control. The second gives the governor control of the state primary and secondary education system, taking it away from the largely independent state <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION>. The third gives cities and counties the ability to merge or choose new forms of government. Leading the campaign against the first amendment are two of the officeholders _ Secretary of State <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Hechler </PERSON>, a Democrat, and Agriculture Commissioner <PERSON> Cleve </PERSON> <PERSON> Benedict </PERSON>, a Republican. `` This is a much larger issue than party loyalty,'' <PERSON> Benedict </PERSON> said. `` This is a very fundamental choice on who we, <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Hechler </PERSON> and I, trust to exercise power _ whether we trust citizens at the ballot box, or whether we trust the political elite.'' <PERSON> Hechler </PERSON> and <PERSON> Benedict </PERSON>, both former congressmen, say they are n't campaigning just to save their jobs; the amendment would n't take effect until their terms end in 1992 `` I'm just a temporary occupant,'' said <PERSON> Hechler </PERSON>. `` It belongs to the people, and future generations ought to continue to have the right to choose whoever they want.'' The third official, Treasurer <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Loehr </PERSON>, supports <PERSON> Caperton </PERSON>'s plan <PERSON> Caperton </PERSON> appointed <PERSON> Loehr </PERSON> to the post in July after two-term Treasurer <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Manchin </PERSON> resigned rather than face trial in the state <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> over the loss of $ 279 million from an investment fund his office supervised. <PERSON> Caperton </PERSON> contends he can save $ 3 million a year by assigning the officeholders' duties to other officials. `` This is not a turf war,'' <PERSON> Caperton </PERSON> said in his weekly radio address last weekend. `` It's an economic battle.'' He said critics who accuse him of a power grab are distorting the issue. Saturday's election comes at a time of widespread trouble in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> politics. In addition to <PERSON> Manchin </PERSON>'s resignation, Attorney General <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> resigned Aug. 21 to halt a grand jury investigation of his campaign financial records and allegations that he lied under oath. Former state <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Tonkovich </PERSON> went on trial Thursday on federal extortion and racketeering charges. Three others, include the former <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> majority leader, pleaded guilty to lesser charges in exchange for their testimony for the government. Supporters and opponents say the special election for 868,802 registered voters could turn into a referendum on <PERSON> Caperton </PERSON>'s first eight months in office. <PERSON> Caperton </PERSON>, a millionaire businessman, won a landslide victory last November over <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> incumbent <PERSON> Arch </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>. One of his first acts was to push through the largest tax increase in state history, $ 392 million, despite a campaign promise not to raise taxes. `` There's a lot of anger out there about the tax increase, a lot of anger about politics of the past, about broken promises,'' <PERSON> Benedict </PERSON> said. `` Those are all probably going to be factors in the outcome.'' Former Gov. <PERSON> Cecil </PERSON> <PERSON> Underwood </PERSON>, who is supporting the amendments, agreed that <PERSON> Caperton </PERSON>'s job performance will be a factor. `` Constitutional revision should never be a referendum on the incumbent,'' <PERSON> Underwood </PERSON> said. `` At the same time, it is almost impossible to keep that element out of the issue.'' A statewide survey conducted Aug. 19-23 for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> Daily Mail and <ORGANIZATION> WSAZ-TV </ORGANIZATION> showed that two-thirds of the registered voters surveyed knew little about the amendments, but a majority said they would vote against the two measures that would give the governor more power. The secretary of state's office maintains records regarding corporations and supervises state election laws. The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> regulates farming and provides assistance to farmers and gardeners. The treasurer's office handles state investments and maintains the state's bank deposits. If voters approve the amendment, the remaining elected statewide jobs will be governor, attorney general and auditor.

 <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> admirals said Thursday it would be virtually impossible to guard against the type of suicidal behavior they believe caused the explosion that killed 47 sailors aboard that USS Iowa last April 19. A <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> report said `` circumstantial evidence'' indicated Gunner's <PERSON> Mate </PERSON> <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON>, who was closest to the breech in the middle gun of turret No 2, dropped a detonator between bags of gun powder being loaded during firing exercises off <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>. `` As with any catastrophe, the immediate impulse is to take every possible step to prevent a recurrence,'' wrote Adm. <PERSON> Carlisle </PERSON> <PERSON> A.H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Trost </PERSON>, the chief of <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Operations </ORGANIZATION> and the top officer in the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>. But <PERSON> Trost </PERSON> said, `` it is virtually impossible to have established procedures to absolutely preclude disastrous results of such an individual choice.'' Documents released with the report show <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON> was depressed over the collapse of a close friendship, and one letter from <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON> 11 days before the explosion eulogized sailors who died in action and said, `` I could become one of those little white headstones in Arlington National Cemetery.'' The report said <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON> `` was emotionally capable of committing suicide, probably with the intent of killing others also.'' The report used the words `` repugnant'' and `` incredulous'' to describe the idea that `` an intentional human act'' sparked the blast, but concluded that <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON> was `` the principle suspect.'' `` We do n't know the motivation,'' said Adm. <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Edney </PERSON>, the vice chief of naval operations. <PERSON> Edney </PERSON> told a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> press conference the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> did not plan to change its psychological screening procedures. `` We did n't see anything that required a drastic change,'' he said. <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON>'s allegedly suicidal character only became apparent after interviews with his acquaintances and family over the course of the four-month investigation, <PERSON> Edney </PERSON> said. `` He was a clean-cut sailor. He did n't smoke. He did n't drink. He did n't carouse on leave. ... He was n't a troublemaker,'' said <PERSON> Edney </PERSON>. The investigation also uncovered lax procedures aboard the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, the report said, and the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> announced immediate steps to correct them. The circumstances of the explosion are muddied by `` a number of major administrative and supervisory discrepancies on board the USS Iowa, as well as substantial and serious failures by senior <LOCATION> USS </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> personnel to properly discharge their responsibilities,'' Adm. <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, commander of the <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fleet </ORGANIZATION>, said in a letter released with the report. But, <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> wrote, `` exhaustive testing and evaluation has virtually ruled out any of these discrepancies as directly causing the deaths of the 47 crewmembers in Turret 2.'' `` Nevertheless, the number and egregriousness o the discrepancies create an impression of laxity and disregard that will cloud the investigations in the minds of non-experts for the immediate future,'' <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> wrote. Among the problems cited in the report were a failure to fully train sailors in the gun turret on firing procedures. To prevent a repeat, `` all battleship weapons departments are to be inspected and deficiencies corrected prior to authorizing full unrestricted use of 16-inch gun systems,'' the report said. Rear Adm. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Milligan </PERSON>, who led the investigation, concluded after numerous tests none of the irregularities could have sparked the blast. He began to investigate the possbibility that the explosion was intentional after receiving a letter from <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON>'s sister, <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kubicina </PERSON>, saying <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON> meant to change the beneficary of a $ 100,000 accident death insurance policy to his parents from another sailor aboard the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Kendall </PERSON> <PERSON> Truitt </PERSON>. <PERSON> Truitt </PERSON> was once a close personal friend of <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON>, but the friendship had cooled after <PERSON> Truitt </PERSON> became involved with a woman, <PERSON> Milligan </PERSON> said. Although <PERSON> Milligan </PERSON> said he found no evidence that <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON> was a homosexual, documents released with the report show investigators were examining possible `` homosexual activity'' and `` <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON>'s alleged homosexuality.

 The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> government promised reform Thursday after suffering heavy losses in an election accompanied by protests and political violence in which 25 people were reported killed. If the death toll is confirmed, it would be the highest in a 24-hour period since 69 blacks were shot to death during a peaceful protest in <LOCATION> Sharpeville </LOCATION> township in 1960. In Wednesday's white parliamentary election, the Nationalists got less than 50 percent of the vote for the first time since 1953. They lost nearly a quarter of their seats to an anti-apartheid party and to a far-right group that favors strict racial segregation. Police used shotguns, tear gas and whips on anti-election protesters in black and mixed-race townships outside <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Essa </PERSON> <PERSON> Moosa </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>, a prominent <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> law firm, said 25 people were killed Wednesday night and early Thursday in seven townships on the sprawling Cape Flats. Activists blamed most of the killings on police. <PERSON> Desmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON>, the black Anglican archbishop, said 23 people were killed and `` we expect the numbers of the dead to grow.'' The newspaper Grassroots said it had confirmed 15 of the bodies were in a mortuary. One victim was a 69-year-old woman whose headless body was found riddled with bullets, said The Star of <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>, the country's largest newspaper The <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Province </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Churches </ORGANIZATION> said at least 100 people were injured, including children. <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Mellet </PERSON>, spokesman for the Law and <ORGANIZATION> Order </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, confirmed 12 deaths. He said at least seven were related to black factional fighting and the others were being investigated. South African <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, an independent news agency, said the <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Flats </LOCATION> resembled `` a war zone ... as residents danced around dozens of burning barricades blocking streets in the area and police fired repeatedly at groups of youths.'' A mixed-race lieutenant said police caused riots Tuesday in the <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>'s Plain area of <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>. Lt. <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Rockman </PERSON> said police `` were just hitting people. They could n't care if they were innocent bystanders. It seemed to me that they were enjoying themselves, feasting on the people. You could just see the killer instinct in their eyes.'' Activists said 11 people were reported killed Wednesday night in <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>'s Plain. Police would not comment on <PERSON> Rockman </PERSON>'s remarks. Violence resumed Thursday afternoon when police with shotguns opened fire on dancing and chanting teen-agers in the mixed-race <LOCATION> Lavender </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> township, said a journalist at the scene. Four people were reportedly killed in the township the night before. The Rev. <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesak </PERSON>, a prominent activist, said the presidency of F.W. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> `` now sits in a pool of blood.'' `` I do n't know how people can become vaguely excited about these elections when ... the man with a new vision has allowed this kind of massacre to take place,'' <PERSON> Boesak </PERSON> said. The outlawed <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, the main black group fighting white rule, said from <LOCATION> Harare </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION>: `` The elections... were a farce and irrelevant to the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> and the oppressed majority of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. `` <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> described the election result as `` a clear mandate'' for his party's gradual political reforms, which envision bringing blacks into the national government on a limited basis within five `` Seventy percent of the whites voted for parties favoring renewal and reform ... and granting political rights,'' he said, linking the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> with the liberal-minded Democrats. He now is acting president. An electoral college is expected to given him a full five-year term next week. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s 5 million whites control the government and the 28 million blacks have no voice in national affairs. Separate Parliament chambers for people of mixed race and Indian descent were established in 1984 but have little power. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, in power since 1948, dropped form 123 seats to 93 in the 166-seat white chamber and received 48.5 percent of the vote. Voters gave the far-right <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> 39 seats, compared with 22 in the old <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, and 31.2 percent of the vote. The anti-apartheid Democrats, who favor a vote of equal weight for every South African, went from 20 seats to 33 with the support of 20 percent of the white electorate. Another election will be held in one rural district because of a tie between Conservative and <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> candidates, officials said. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> said emphasis must be `` on intensive dialogue, and hopefully from that must flow real negotiations'' with blacks. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> issued a statement that congratulated <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> on his party's victory, then said: `` Apartheid must end. The elections themselves once more underscore the systematic denial of political rights to the majority population in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. ... Promises of reform must be followed by concrete, specific action.'' Elections for the mixed-race and Indian chambers also were held Wednesday, but anti-apartheid activists urged a boycott and fewer than 10 percent of voters turned out in some districts. The <ORGANIZATION> Mass </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>, which organized a nationwide defiance campaign in the past several weeks, said about 3 million people joined a general strike Wednesday. It claimed `` more people participated in our protest action against the racist elections than voted.''

 A man climbed over a safety barrier inside the dome of <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paul </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cathedral </ORGANIZATION> and leapt 105 feet to his death Thursday, a witness said. The cathedral was filled with tourists, when the unidentified man plummeted from the dome's Whispering Gallery onto metal folding chairs. French student <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Peyrou </PERSON>, who saw it, said there was no time for anyone to act. <PERSON> Peyrou </PERSON>, 23, from <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, said he was standing about 15 feet from the man, who he said was about 50 years old. `` I looked up and I could see a man climbing over the barrier. Very quickly he then leapt over. There was no chance for anyone to grab him or stop him.'' Several fatal falls have occurred from the gallery and safety barriers were built after one such incident in the 19th century. The last previous fatality came in the 1920s, according to the dean of <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paul </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION>, the Very Rev. <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>. The round Whispering Gallery is a special attraction at the cathedral _ Sir <PERSON> Chrisopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Wren </PERSON>'s 17th-century masterpiece. Sound is reflected off the walls and a whisper can be heard clearly more than 100 feet away.

 Police once again are hunting for <PERSON> Zbigniew </PERSON> <PERSON> Najmrodzki </PERSON> who made his fourth prison break through a tunnel dug under the penitentiary courtyard, <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> news agency said Thursday. <PERSON> Najmrodzki </PERSON>, 35, was awaiting trial for assault and burglary in <LOCATION> Gliwice </LOCATION>, southern <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, when he escaped on Saturday, <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> said. It said he was taking a routine half-hour walk in the prison courtyard when he disappeared underground into the camouflaged entrance to a tunnel running 18 feet under the prison wall to a nearby school. <PERSON> Najmrodzki </PERSON>'s accomplices had even installed electric lighting in the tunnel, the report said, adding that the tunnel led to a schoolroom and from there he disappeared into heavy street traffic. <PERSON> Najmrodzki </PERSON> `` never quite got used to the idea of serving his prison terms,'' <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> said. It said hefirst escaped in 1978 while being transported in a military convoy; escaped from a court while on trial in 1980, and knocked down a guard and walked out of a police station dressed in police uniform in 1985. He was caught each time, but the agency gave no details as to how.

 Former Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenrette </PERSON> was released from jail Thursday after serving a 30-day sentence for stealing a necktie and shoes from a suburban <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> discount store, his attorney said. `` He was released in a normal procedure. He will begin performing community service soon,'' said attorney <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Merril </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jenrette </PERSON>, 53, was sentenced to the jail time and 200 hours of community service last month on convictionm of two counts of petty larceny for shoplifting at a <ORGANIZATION> Marshall </ORGANIZATION>'s discount department store in nearby Tyson's Corner last Dec. 7. The former <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> congressman also was placed on on two year's probation and ordered to continue psychiatric and alcoholism treatments. At his sentencing, <PERSON> Jenrette </PERSON> said he was sorry, and did n't know why he stole the items. `` I can only say that I'll never be back. Why I let this happen, I do n't know,'' he said. <PERSON> Jenrette </PERSON> also said the conviction dashed his hopes of regaining his licenswe to practice law. <PERSON> Jenrette </PERSON>, a member of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> from 1975 to 1980, served 13 months in prison after his conviction on bribery and conspiracy charges in the ABSCAM congressional sting operation of the 1970s.

As <PERSON> Jenrette </PERSON> is still on probation in that case, he will likely face a hearing before a federal probation board to assess the latest conviction, <ORGANIZATION> Merril </ORGANIZATION> said. But no hearing has been scheduled, he added.

 Two Soviet cosmonauts successfully completed a series of maneuvers on board their Soyuz TM-8 spacecraft early Friday to dock up with the Mir orbiting complex, the official news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said the Soyuz capsule hooked up with the space station at 2:25 a.m. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> time -LRB- 6:25 p.m. EDT Thursday -RRB-, five minutes later than scheduled. The cosmonauts carried out two manuevers earlier Thursday to bring their craft close to the space station, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. `` Everything is in order on board, and the cosmonauts feel well,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. Commander <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Viktorenko </PERSON> and engineer <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Serebrov </PERSON> blasted off from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> early Wednesday to reman the space station after it was left vacant for more than four months.

Their mission was delayed because the new modules were not ready and because of sharp public discussion that has surfaced in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> over expenditures for space exploration at a time when the country is running a high budget deficit and seeking ways to improve supplies of many consumer goods.

<HEAD>Southern Command Accuses Panama of Jamming Radio, TV</HEAD>

 The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday accused <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> of jamming English-language radio and television broadcasts aimed at the American military based in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. It said in a communique that the jamming `` could potentially thwart <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Forces' Canal defense missions or endanger military and civilian personnel if it prevented the reception of emergency Command advisories.'' Repeated telephone calls to <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> spokesmen for comment were unavailing. Jamming occurs when there are news reports about <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> or related stories, a Southern Command official said. The Command's TV station <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> carries local, national and international news and programs for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces and their dependents in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. The signal is beamed from a hill in the former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Canal Zone and can be received up to 50 miles away. No opposition news media are allowed in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. The Southern Command encompasses 10 military installations where nearly 14,000 soldiers and their dependents are based. Under terms of the 1977 <ORGANIZATION> Panama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaties </ORGANIZATION>, the bases may remain until the end of 1999, when <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> takes full responsibility for operation and defense of the waterway. Panamanian-U.S. relations have been tense since two <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> grand juries indicted <PERSON> Pnama </PERSON>'s leader Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> on drug trafficking charges in February 1988. The Southern Command also complained of jamming of its TV programs before and after the May 7 presidential election. At the time, the Panamanian government denied it was jamming the broadcasts. International observers said the opposition won the election, which <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> had annulled. As Defense Forces chief, he is the most powerful man in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. Hundreds of university students staged a brief anti-government protest Thursday by forming a human chain on campus, but no incidents occurred. They were protesting the arrest of three students during disturbances last month.

 Two masked men trying to hold up an armored car opened fire inside <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>'s world headquarters Thursday, killing one guard and wounding two other men before fleeing on 10-speed bicycles. An intensive search of the city's crowded financial district, involving police, <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents, transit police and the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION>, was launched for the pair, dressed in blue jeans and baseball caps. <ORGANIZATION> Brink </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> offered a $ 100,000 reward for information leading to the apprehension of the suspects, described as white males in their 30s, said the armored car company's corporate vice-president, Buck Crebs. An empty Brink's bag was found at the scene and some envelopes, their contents unknown, were missing, said officer <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Ambrose </PERSON>. Neither authorities nor the bank would immediately release details on what might have been stolen. `` It looks like a well-planned, well-orchestrated robbery,'' said Deputy Chief <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Gurnett </PERSON>. <PERSON> Ambrose </PERSON> said the ski-masked bandits apparently entered the 52-story building shortly before 10 a.m. through a sidewalk-level door on <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION>, while the Brink's guards entered on Pine Street, a parallel street on the opposite side of the building. The four apparently met near the rear indoor entrance to the city's main Bank of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> branch. The robbers opened fire, hitting both guards, said <PERSON> Ambrose </PERSON>. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gee </PERSON>, 57, of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, apparently tried to intervene and also was shot, said <PERSON> Ambrose </PERSON>. Brink's identified the dead guard as <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> San </PERSON> <PERSON> Arriola </PERSON>, 53, of <LOCATION> Vallejo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>. The father of six children, <PERSON> Arriola </PERSON> was a five-year veteran of the company. He suffered gunshot wounds to the face and the back of the head. The other wounded guard was identified as <PERSON> Clifford </PERSON> <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON>, 24, a part-time Brink's employee who started working for the company 2 -LCB- months ago. <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON> underwent surgery to remove a bullet that entered above the left eyebrow, ricocheted off the skull and entered the upper spine, hospital officials said. He was in serious condition with paralysis on his left side before surgery, hospital spokeswoman <PERSON> Gloria </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> said. Gee was wounded in the mouth, she said. He was listed in fair condition. <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Adami </PERSON>, owner of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Smoke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shop </ORGANIZATION>, on the same floor but out of sight of the bank entrance, said Gee collapsed at her stand, but was conscious and asked for help. `` He said, ` There's been a robbery. I've been shot. I'm hurt,' and his teeth were all out,'' she said. Gee gave <PERSON> Adami </PERSON>, and later police, a description of the robbers before he was taken for medical treatment. <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> is a subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> BankAmerica </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, one of the nation's largest banking concerns. The building is the city's largest in terms of square feet

 Officials of two dozen Western nations will hold a conference Sept. 26 on ways to provide badly needed economic aid to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday. More than 100 officials met last month at the 12-nation trading bloc's <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> headquarters for an initial assessment of the need and of aid available for the two reform-minded communist nations. A spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>, who demanded anonymity, said the conference would consider aid programs already begun and that another high-level meeting may be scheduled for later this year. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and leaders of other affluent democracies asked during their annual economic summit in July that the <ORGANIZATION> EC </ORGANIZATION> coordinate economic aid for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. Western nations want to encourage the trend toward economic and political reform in both countries. The <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> said it began emergency shipments of beef to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> this week and half the total of 10,000 tons was expected to arrive next week. It is part of a $ 120 million food aid package for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> agreed to in July by agriculture ministers of the 12 Common Market countries. <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> is being given the food under an arrangement that allows the government to sell it to consumers and use the money to improve private agriculture. According to the spokesman, a delegation from the trading bloc will visit <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> soon for further discussions. In <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>, the officials are expected to sign a recently completed agreement on expanding trade and cooperation between <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and the European Community over five years. At last month's meeting on <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> pledged to send <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> $ 50 million worth of food from surplus stocks. In July, President <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> needed 685,000 tons of beef, pork, powdered milk, butter, oils, wheat, corn, rice and sugar in the next few months. He said it would need at least 3.7 million tons of food next year and again in 1991.

 Five <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> technicians came to <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> at government request on Thursday to help investigate why a Brazilian jetliner crashed far off course in the <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> jungle, killing at least 10 of the 54 people aboard. <ORGANIZATION> Varig </ORGANIZATION> airlines President <PERSON> Helio </PERSON> <PERSON> Smidt </PERSON> did not rule out the possibility of pilot error. `` I would be very happy if human failure could be ruled out,'' he told reporters Thursday. `` But we do not want to jump to conclusions.'' The pilot, <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> <PERSON> Garces </PERSON>, 32, did not speak with the press after arriving in <LOCATION> Brasilia </LOCATION> on Wednesday. Sixteen survivors of the Sunday night crash left the hospital on Thursday. Of the 35 survivors treated at the <LOCATION> Brasilia </LOCATION> Base hospital, 21 now have been released and two remain in the intensive care unit, a doctor said. Reports conflicted on the number of dead. Air force officials reported 10 dead. A <ORGANIZATION> Varig </ORGANIZATION> spokesman listed 11 deaths. The <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737-200 vanished Sunday night on the last leg of a flight between <LOCATION> Sao </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paulo </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Belem </LOCATION>, at the mouth of the <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. After six scheduled stops, the plane took off from <LOCATION> Maraba </LOCATION> at 5:25 p.m. for what was supposed to be a 41-minute flight to <LOCATION> Belem </LOCATION>. But the plane strayed far off course, circled above dense tropical jungle for three hours, then crash-landed near <LOCATION> Sao </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION> do <LOCATION> Xingu </LOCATION>, in north-central <LOCATION> Mato </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grosso </LOCATION> state, with just 15 minutes of fuel left, authorities said. Brazilian investigators reached the crash site on Wednesday and began a search for the plane's flight registers, which log flight patterns, pilot conversations and other data. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> sent five experts who arrived Thursday in <LOCATION> Brasilia </LOCATION>, the capital, and later left for the crash site. Americans involved in the investigation include an adviser from the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> and three experts from the Seattle-based <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. The local press reported Thursday that a malfunction in the plane's navigational system was possible, but experts reportedly said the pilot could have used a magnetic compass in the instrument panel. <PERSON> Surivivor </PERSON> <PERSON> Epaminondas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Sousa </PERSON> <PERSON> Chaves </PERSON>, 36, said Wednesday that soon after takeoff from <LOCATION> Maraba </LOCATION>, the pilot `` began heading southeast instead of north.'' `` Thirty minutes later the pilot told us to prepare for the landing, but I know the area well and I thought it was strange to see that we were flying above a river with waterfalls and small islands,'' said <LOCATION> Chaves </LOCATION>. At least three other survivors interviewed by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> agreed with <ORGANIZATION> Chaves </ORGANIZATION>' account. Two other survivors, <PERSON> Rita </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cassia </PERSON> and <PERSON> Elza </PERSON> <PERSON> Gasparim </PERSON>, said the plane at one point descended as if it were going to land, then pulled up sharply after dark forest cover was sighted below. <ORGANIZATION> Chaves </ORGANIZATION> said the pilot announced over the intercom, `` Pray to God and pray that we will find a place to land. There are only 15 minutes of fuel left.'' The plane's belly clipped the top of the 100-foot-high trees, the aircraft `` seemed to bounce,'' then smashed through the forest cover, ripping off both wings but leaving the fuselage nearly intact, he said. The plane ripped a hole 300 feet by 120 feet in the jungle, but did not explode, <ORGANIZATION> Chaves </ORGANIZATION> said.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, forced to choose between preserving its members' mass-mailing privileges and approving aid for drug rehabilitation programs, voted overwhelmingly Thursday to give $ 45 million to help addicted pregnant women, mothers and infants. Faced with a recorded vote on whether to slash money for unsolicited mailings, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> decided 83-8 to approve the amendment, which was attached to a $ 2 billion legislative-expense budget for fiscal 1990. It was the first such assistance measure acted upon by either chamber since President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> announced his $ 7.9 billion anti-drug abuse campaign Tuesday. Republicans, led by Sen. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, R-Calif., proposed the measure Wednesday It was aimed at transferring to drug treatment programs a large sum of money from the account legislators use for their mailings. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> gave the overall legislative appropriations bill final passage on an 81-9 vote late Thursday. The measure will have to be reconciled with a $ 1.6 billion House-passed version. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> measure virtually eliminates district-wide mailings used often by senators and representatives to keep their names before their constituents, but allows them to continue answering individual queries. Sen. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Boren </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Okla </LOCATION>., told colleagues the bulk of the money used for mass mailings is spent by senators seeking to bolster their chances for re-election He said that was wrong. `` We're approaching some $ 70 million a year on mass mailings to the public that have not been solicited ... figures show a much higher percentage of the mass mailings are by those who are up for re-election,'' he said. Sen. <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Alaska </LOCATION>, led the opposition, saying mass-mailed newsletters were indispensable tools of communication with his constituents. But <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said, `` This is an opportunity for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to do something about something we have talked about,'' he said. `` So, let's begin to break the habit and let's begin to help those who need help.'' Also voting against the amendment were Sens. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.J. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Hollings </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-S.C. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Inouye </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Hawaii </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Lieberman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Conn </LOCATION>.; <PERSON> Spark </PERSON> <PERSON> Matsunaga </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Hawaii </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Moynihan </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, D-Ill. <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> and <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> are the only two of the eight who are up for re-election next Nine senators did not vote: <PERSON> Brock </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, D-Wash., <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON>, R-Colo., <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Baucus </PERSON>, D-Mont., <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON> <PERSON> Burns </PERSON>, R-Mont., <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> McClure </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Idaho </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Murkowski </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Alaska </LOCATION>, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Roth </PERSON>, R-Del., <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanford </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.C. </LOCATION>, and The money would go to a program started in 1988 that provides treatment to drug-addicted pregnant women, mothers and infants, focusing on crack. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said 400,000 babies are born annually to mothers who use drugs. Without <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>'s amendment, the legislative spending bill would have limited congressional spending on mail next year to $ 80 million: $ 48 million for the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, which has 435 members, and $ 32 million for the 100-member <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. The <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> amendment slashes the total for both chambers from $ 80 billion to $ 35 million. The bulk of that money would be used to cover a shortfall in mailing expenses for the current budget year, which ends Sept. 30, leaving little mass-mailing money for fiscal 1990, which starts Oct. 1. The House-passed bill seeks to allocate $ 124.7 million for all congressional mailing privileges in the new budget year. The nine senators voting against the overall $ 2 billion measure were: <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON>, R-Colo.; <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON>, D-S; <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>, D-Ill.; <PERSON> Jake </PERSON> <PERSON> Garn </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Utah </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.C. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Connie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mack </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Fla </LOCATION>.; <PERSON> Mitch </PERSON> <PERSON> McConnell </PERSON>, R-Ky.; <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Symms </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Idaho </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallop </PERSON> Not voting were <PERSON> Brock </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, D-Wash., <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Baucus </PERSON>, D-Mont., <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON> <PERSON> Burns </PERSON>, R-Mont., <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Trent </PERSON> <PERSON> Lott </PERSON>, R-Miss., <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Murkowski </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Alaska </LOCATION>, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Roth </PERSON>, R-Del., <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanford </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.C. </LOCATION>, and

<HEAD>Study: Divorce Rates Higher When Wives Better Educated Than Husbands</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY ROSENTHAL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Married couples are more likely to divorce if the woman has more education than her husband, a study concludes. The study found that the divorce rate for marriages in which the wife has more schooling than her husband is over 50 percent higher than it is for marriages in which the husband has the same or higher educational achievement. `` Apparently many men and women have not been socialized to accept the notion of a woman being educationally more accomplished than her husband,'' said <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, an associate professor of sociology at <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, who led the study. That women are better able to support themselves and less fearful of going it alone, could account for the higher rate of divorce, <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said. `` We might have expected that couples who had very different levels of education, regardless of which spouse had the higher education, would have higher divorce rates than average because these couples would have different world views and be subject to greater conflict and stress in their marriage. `` But that was not true. We found only couples in which the wife was more educated than the husband had higher divorce rates than average,'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said in an interview Wednesday. In the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, about half of all marriages today will end in divorce. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>'s study has not been published, but the results were presented last month at the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sociological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. The study was based on data from nearly 3,500 married or divorced women under age 50, collected by the National Survey of Families and Households between March 1987 and May 1988. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> received widespread attention three years ago when he concluded that single, college-educated women over age 30 had only a 20 percent chance of getting married. A <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> researcher, studying the same statistics, disputed his findings, and said those same women actually have a 66 percent chance of eventually marrying. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> has done a new study on the same subject with more recent data, but the results will not be made public until they are published in November. In looking at divorce rates, the <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> researchers also examined the effects of religious differences on marriages. Not unexpectedly, they found that divorce rates are higher for couples in interfaith marriages. When a wife and husband have different religion, but both are not very religious, the divorce rate is not much different from the average, the study found. To study the effect of educational differences, the women and men were placed in four different educational categories: those with less than a high school education, those with a high school education, those with some college education and those with at least a college degree. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> emphasized that men and women who marry someone who has a substantially different education, religous belief or age are generally less traditional than those who marry people with similar characteristics, and may therefore have less conventional views about marriage to begin with. Such factors, however, can not be measured.

 Sevens whites accused of killing a black teen-ager in the mostly white <LOCATION> Bensonhurst </LOCATION> district will be tried before a black judge whose assignment bypassed the usual selection process, court officials said Thursday. Justice <PERSON> Thaddeus </PERSON> <PERSON> Owens </PERSON>, 70, was selected by a panel of judges and court administrators last week because of his experience and his ability to handle cases receiving a lot of publicity, said <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Crosson </PERSON>, chief administrator of the state court system. <PERSON> Owens </PERSON>' race played no part in the selection, <PERSON> Crosson </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Owens </PERSON> was named solely because of his judicial excellence, <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> Chief Judge <PERSON> Sol </PERSON> <PERSON> Wachtler </PERSON>, who oversees court administration, told the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>, which first reported the selection in its Thursday editions. The judge had no comment on his appointment or on the case, his clerk said. Lawyers for the young white men charged in the Aug. 23 attack greeted the announcement with mixed reactions. The attorney for the accused shooter said he might file a motion to block it. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> DePetris </PERSON>, who represents 18-year-old <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Fama </PERSON>, said he objected `` not because of the judge that was selected but because it may violate my client's rights.'' <PERSON> Fama </PERSON>, who is being held without bail in the <ORGANIZATION> Brooklyn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Detention </ORGANIZATION>, has been charged with murder in the attack and is suspected of firing the shots that killed 16-year-old <PERSON> Yusuf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON> and three of his friends had gone to the mostly white <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> neighborhood to look at a used car when they were set upon by a gang of some 30 bat-carrying whites, the police said. Seven young white men who allegedly took part in the attack have been arrested and the police say they expect to pick up other suspects. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Santangelo </PERSON>, the lawyer for 21-year-old <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Stressler </PERSON>, labeled the selection `` indiscreet, insensitive and illegal.'' However, <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Aronne </PERSON>, lawyer for 19-year-old <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Serrano </PERSON>, praised the selection, as did <PERSON> Mathew </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mari </PERSON>, the attorney for 18-year-old <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Curreri </PERSON>. `` I've known <PERSON> Thaddeus </PERSON> <PERSON> Owens </PERSON> for a number of years and have tried a number of cases before him. He is a good man and a good judge,'' <PERSON> Aronne </PERSON> said. `` He's tough and we need someone tough who calls it the way he sees it.'' Judges usually are selected at random or specialize in certain types of cases. But for trials expected to generate high interest or controversy, court officials frequently handpick whomever they believe most suited to handle the case, <PERSON> Crosson </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 The non-aligned movement ended its ninth summit conference early Friday after adopting a resolution calling for the release of all hostages. The four-day conference of 102 nations was attended by about 50 heads of state and a dozen prime ministers. It was due to end Thursday, but delays brought on by wrangling between hard-liners and moderates kept the summit going until after 1 a.m. Friday. The session passed a final declaration and adopted 30 political and economic resolutions dealing with topics ranging from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> to terrorism and drugs trafficking. Many of them were compromise resolutions, reflecting the deep divisions among members. The `` international terrorism'' resolution was agreed upon by the meeting's political committee after tough bargaining. It said the heads of state and government `` resolutely demanded that all hostages and all kidnapped persons be immediately released ... irrespective of the perpetrators and the place of the crime.'' The resolution condemned all acts of terrorism perpetrated by individuals, states or groups of states and expressed the movement's determination to fight such acts `` with all possible legal means, both nationally and internationally. Yugoslav spokesman <PERSON> Goran </PERSON> <PERSON> Milic </PERSON> indicated in a meeting with reporters at midnight that the final session was delayed about 5 -LCB- hours by disputes. Pleas for pragmatism and cooperation with the industrialized world contrasted with strident attacks on the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Several delegates denounced `` Zionism'' in their speeches, a topic that caused problems to the very end. Chairman <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> insisted that in addition to the final document's stressing the `` struggle against imperialism, colonialism, neo-colonialism, racism and apartheid,'' it should also condemn `` Zionism and its practices.'' Heated arguments with moderates followed, with <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> drawing support from such hard-liners as <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Yemen </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. A compromise was reached on including the `` Zionism'' reference in one of the many political resolutions, sources told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, speaking on condition of anonymity. <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, in a bid to gain international prestige, sought to get the summit to agree to hold its next summit there, but no agreement was reached, conference sources said. Delegates did agree, however, that <LOCATION> Ghana </LOCATION> would be the site for a non-aligned foreign ministers' conference to be held in 1991 in preparation of the 10th non-aligned summit. Moderates have emerged as the big majority and resisted throughout the summit attempts by radical nations to introduce cold war rhetoric. Yugoslav President <PERSON> Janez </PERSON> <PERSON> Drnovsek </PERSON> told the closing session, `` We have achieved a high degree of unity about what the future of our movement should be.''

 A 30-year-old woman who was raped, beaten, stabbed and left to die in a crawl space of her burning home used her blood to scrawl the attacker's name on a wall, and police Thursday arrested her next-door neighbor. The woman, described by police as `` very, very brave,'' also cut her way out of the burning house with the knife that stabbed her and scaled a six-foot wall to escape, police said. She was in fair condition Thursday after undergoing surgery at <ORGANIZATION> Denver </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> to repair sliced tendons in her right wrist. `` She's alert and awake ... but still is very frightened because this person is still at large as far as I know,'' said <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Duchon </PERSON>, a hospital spokeswoman. <PERSON> Donnie </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Russell </PERSON>, 18, who has lived next door to the victim for about two years, was arrested at a truck stop in <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> at 4:20 p.m. MDT, said <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> police Sgt. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Matthews </PERSON>. `` We got a teletype from the <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> police saying that <PERSON> Donnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> had told them he was wanted for rape, arson and attempted murder in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>,'' said <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> Detective <PERSON> Christine </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallis </PERSON>. <PERSON> Matthews </PERSON> said police in <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> had gotten an anonymous phone call that <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> would be coming through the city trying to contact relatives. <PERSON> Wallis </PERSON> said extradition procedures would be started Friday. The woman's ordeal began Wednesday morning when she let <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> into her home to use a telephone, police said. She was robbed of jewelry and money and raped in the basement, <PERSON> Wallis </PERSON> said. She was beaten about the head with a hammer, stabbed in the arm and hand and left in the crawl space, which had been closed off with furniture. Her home then was set afire. The woman managed to write, `` <PERSON> Donnie </PERSON>, next door,'' in blood on the wall before she kicked her way out of the crawl space, <PERSON> Wallis </PERSON> said. She then used the foot-long knife that she had been stabbed with to break the basement window and then scaled a 6-foot fence in her backyard, screaming for help, police said. `` She is a very brave, gutsy woman,'' <PERSON> Wallis </PERSON> said Thursday after interviewing the victim in her hospital room. `` She at one point feigned unconsciousness and grabbed the knife from him.'' The residents in the middle-class northeast <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> neighborhood did n't know whether she was in trouble or looking for it. `` People did n't want to get involved,'' <PERSON> Wallis </PERSON> said. But one woman, who asked not to be identified, telephoned police after hearing the victim scream, `` Help me. Somebody help me.'' `` I looked out the window to make sure it was n't some kids playing around. I saw her climbing over the fence with a knife in her hand. I went and called the police,'' the neighbor said. `` She was disheveled, beat up, bloody, half-dressed. She looked crazy. Now that I've heard what happened, I guess I would be crazy, too,'' the neighbor said. After the incident, <PERSON> Wallis </PERSON> left her business card in <PERSON> Russell </PERSON>'s front door and he called her later in the day He promised to go to police headquarters and answer questions, but never arrived, she said. He lives with an uncle, and <PERSON> Wallis </PERSON> said both the uncle and the victim's husband were shocked to learn that he was a suspect in the attack.

 The 25-year-old sailor accused of causing the USS Iowa explosion that killed 47 soliders grew up as a Seventh Day Adventist and is remembered as a religious and devoted student. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> released a report Thursday that said gunner's mate <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON> `` most likely'' caused the April 19 explosion that ranks as the worst <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> naval disaster since the Viet Nam war. <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON> attended <LOCATION> Lakewood </LOCATION> Seventh Day Adventist Elementary school and graduated from <ORGANIZATION> Mount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vernon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION>, a Seventh Day Adventist school in <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vernon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. Seventh Day Adventists are vegetarians who neither smoke nor drink alcohol and coffee. They attend church on Saturday and believe in the second coming of <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Christ </PERSON>. <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> Allison </PERSON>, maintenance director at of the co-educational school of 140 students about 40 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON> worked for him part of the day, doing manual tasks and supervising students, and went to classes the other half of the day. `` He was religious and a devoted worker,'' <PERSON> Allison </PERSON> said Thursday. `` Whatever task he did, he did it efficiently _ he got good grades.'' <PERSON> Allison </PERSON> said he did not believe the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s report. `` They got a scapegoat. They have to blame it on someone and he is not here to defend himself,'' <PERSON> Allison </PERSON> said. While attending the academy, <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON> enjoyed camping and the outdoors, but his heart was set on joining the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Allison </PERSON> said. `` He went straight into the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- after graduation -RRB- because it was his love. He came back once a year to see the students,'' <PERSON> Allison </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON>'s sister, <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Kubicina </PERSON>, said Seventh Day Adventists do not believe in violence or the firing of guns, but the family allowed <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON> to join the service because he had a great desire to do so. Ms. <PERSON> Kubicina </PERSON> said <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON> had a girlfriend, <PERSON> Charlene </PERSON> <PERSON> Meter </PERSON>, and he wrote her a number of letters while he was aboard the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>. Copies of 11 letters written by <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON> were provided to The Associated Press by Ms. <PERSON> Kubicina </PERSON>. Ten were written to Ms. Meter and one was written to his parents. `` For the last 6 yrs, all I've known is the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>,'' wrote <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> in a Nov. 8 letter. `` I'm military through and through and at times it's hard for me to get along with civilians. `` I guess it's like this. I have no idea what goes on in your life in college. Your problems from day to day, your frustrations, the people you ca n't stand, what you do. It's the same for you with me. There's no way you could understand what it's like to live in a cramped ship and be at sea for months at a time,'' he wrote. Following the explosion, at the request of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Anaylysis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Violent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crimes </ORGANIZATION> conducted a psychiatric study and found that <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON> was disturbed and under a lot of stress, `` virtually insuring some type of reaction. In this instance, it is suicide.'' <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON> and gunner's mate <PERSON> Kendall </PERSON> <PERSON> Truitt </PERSON>, 21, each bought $ 50,000 life insurance policies from the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> credit union just before the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> left for the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> in 1987. <PERSON> Truitt </PERSON> since has married and has denied suggestions he was involved in a homosexual relationship with <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON>'s family rejects the enquiry's conclusion and is calling for a congressional investigation into the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s handling of the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> probe.

<HEAD>Woman Convicted in Slaying Of Lesbian Lover</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WEST PALM BEACH, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A woman who used the `` battered spouse'' defense against charges she killed her lesbian lover was convicted Thursday of second-degree murder. <PERSON> Annette </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON>, 30, was found guilty by a jury in the Oct. 30, 1988, shooting death of her 11-year lover, <PERSON> Ivonne </PERSON> <PERSON> Julio </PERSON>. The jury found that Ms. <PERSON> Green </PERSON>'s shooting of Ms. <PERSON> Julio </PERSON>, 32, was not premeditated, and decided on the lesser charge. Prosecutors had sought a first-degree murder conviction, which could bring the death penalty. The two-week trial was reportedly the first time a lesbian had tried the `` battered spouse'' defense, which some women have successfully used after slaying an abusive husband or lover. Ms. <PERSON> Green </PERSON> faces a 12 - to 17-year prison term Palm Beach Circuit Judge <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Waddell </PERSON> ordered a pre-sentencing investigation but set no sentencing date. Defense Attorney <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Lasley </PERSON> said in his closing argument earlier Thursday that Ms. <PERSON> Julio </PERSON> beat and tormented Ms. <PERSON> Green </PERSON> for years. <PERSON> Lasley </PERSON> made no statement after the verdict, and gave no immediate indication whether he would appeal the ruling. Assistant State Attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> told reporters afterwards that he felt the case did not support use of the `` battered spouse'' syndrome. On Tuesday, <PERSON> Wadell </PERSON> ruled to allow the battered spouse defense in the case. The judge said the type of relationship made no difference. Ms. <PERSON> Green </PERSON> testified in her own defense during the trial, saying she `` never wanted to do anything to -LRB- Ms. <PERSON> Julio </PERSON> -RRB-.'' `` I was just trying to defend myself,'' she said. Ms. <PERSON> Green </PERSON> also testified that after she shot Ms. <PERSON> Julio </PERSON> following an argument, she then held the gun to her own head. `` I was going to kill myself ... because I loved her,'' she said.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Quaker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oats </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> has duped consumers by claiming its oatmeal can help reduce the risk of heart disease, the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Attorney General's office said Thursday in suing the nation's biggest seller of hot cereal `` We are in the middle of an oat bran craze in this country that was primarily started and prompted by <ORGANIZATION> Quaker </ORGANIZATION> in order to sell its products,'' Attorney General <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Mattox </PERSON> said at a news conference. `` Consumers have been duped. Quaker's claims are largely not true,'' he said. Spokesmen for Chicago-based Quaker Oats defended the advertisements, saying they feel the advertising is truthful and is supported by scientific evidence. `` We expect to prevail in this litigation,'' said <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> McKinney </PERSON>, senior vice president of law and corporate affairs for Quaker Oats. In the lawsuit, filed on behalf of the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> in a <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> state district court, the state said <ORGANIZATION> Quaker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oats </ORGANIZATION>' ads as `` replete with exaggerations, half-truths, and misinformation.'' One of those ads reads, `` Studies say that just two ounces of <ORGANIZATION> Quaker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oats </ORGANIZATION> a day, along with a low-fat, low-cholesterol diet, can help lower your cholesterol almost 10 percent. Other studies say that's enough to reduce your risk of heart attack by nearly 20 percent.'' The state claims <ORGANIZATION> Quaker </ORGANIZATION>'s own tests showed that only a 3 percent reduction in risk could be realized if oatmeal was added to a low-fat, low-cholesterol diet. And that reduction applied only to women if they ate 25 percent more oatmeal than <ORGANIZATION> Quaker </ORGANIZATION> recommends as a regular serving, <PERSON> Mattox </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Mattox </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Quaker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oats </ORGANIZATION> has `` a good product, but it's only cereal. It's not a heart-attack preventative.'' <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Vottrell </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Quaker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oats </ORGANIZATION>, said the ad was cleared by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, which reviewed it after complaints were lodged by the Center for Science in the <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interest </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> consumer rights group. The <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> lawsuit, filed under the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Deceptive Trade Practices-Consumer Protection Act, asks the court to prohibit the company from continuing its allegedly misleading ads and seeks $ 10,000 in civil penalties and additional court and investigative costs. Assistant Attorney General <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON>, who is prosecuting the case, said the lawsuit is part of an ongoing examination of food manufacturers' health claims. `` Quaker was not so much jumping on the health-claims bandwagon as being the horse that was pulling it. We wanted to look first at the companies that were responsible for creating a series of outrageous claims about what their product can do for your health,'' he said. <PERSON> Mattox </PERSON> has recently taken on other giant food companies, such as <ORGANIZATION> Campbell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Soup </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Sara </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Carnation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, saying they have engaged in false advertising. The companies all deny the claims.

 Singer <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Toya </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> denied Thursday that she married her manager in a quiet civil ceremony here, saying an imposter had signed her name to <LOCATION> Washoe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> court wedding documents. `` It could have been an imposter,'' Ms. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said in a telephone interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's totally untrue that I got married. I'm not ready for marriage yet. I'm too involved in my career right now.'' <LOCATION> Washoe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Clerk <PERSON> Judi </PERSON> <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> on Thursday produced marriage license No. D044127 purchased Tuesday by <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Toya </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, 33, and <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON>, 50, and said the couple went through a legal wedding ceremony that night. `` They had to show their driver's licenses and tell the clerk all kinds of information in order to prove who they were,'' Ms. <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON> said. `` They even had to know their mothers' maiden name and where she was born. And where their father was born. `` She got married right here in the <ORGANIZATION> Washoe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> chambers. When they say ` I do' before a witness and the deputy marriage commissioner then they're married.'' Ms. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> had been in the gambling city to perform a concert at <ORGANIZATION> Bally </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Reno </PERSON> that is scheduled to be televised later on pay television, and which kicked off her world tour produced by <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON>. `` I was surprised when I heard about it,'' Ms. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. `` I have no idea why someone would say that.'' According to <ORGANIZATION> Washoe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> documents, it was the second marriage for <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, native who was divorced in 1982, and the first marriage for Ms. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, a native of <PERSON> Gary </PERSON>, Ind. Ms. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said her relationship with <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> is `` strictly professional.'' `` He's a great man but not a person I'd settle down with,'' she said. Ms. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> moved out of her parents' home in May after an apparent rift developed between her and her family because of her relationship with <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON>, a former carnival operator and <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> businessman. The rift is only one of several that has reportedly kept Ms. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> at odds with her family in the past year. She posed nude in the January issue of Playboy which ran a 12-page spread on the sister of pop recording star <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. And her family has reportedly been trying to get her to tone down an alleged `` tell-all'' autobiography scheduled to be published next year.

 The brother-in-law of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s former president was indicted on perjury charges Thursday, nearly a month after he was taken into custody for questioning as a material witness in the slaying of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> drug agent. <PERSON> Ruben </PERSON> <PERSON> Zuno </PERSON> <PERSON> Arce </PERSON>, 59, was accused in the indictment of lying when he told a federal grand jury in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> that he did not know two alleged Mexican drug figures charged in the killing of <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> agent <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON>. In his grand jury testimony, he apparently denied knowing <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON> <PERSON> Caro </PERSON> <PERSON> Quintero </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ernesto </PERSON> <PERSON> Fonseca </PERSON> <PERSON> Carrillo </PERSON>. <PERSON> Zuno </PERSON>, a prominent Mexican businessman, was arrested Aug. 9 in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION> by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> immigration officials and brought to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> to testify as a material witness in the 1985 killing of <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON>. But a judge Tuesday found that <PERSON> Zuno </PERSON> was not a material witness and ordered him released. The order, however, was blocked by <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> officials on grounds that <PERSON> Zuno </PERSON> is an alleged drug trafficker. <PERSON> Zuno </PERSON>, brother of the wife of former Mexican President <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Echeverria </PERSON>, was taken back to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>, where he was being held on an immigration warrant. Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Medrano </PERSON> denied the indictment was an attempt to keep <PERSON> Zuno </PERSON> in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` The indictment speaks for itself. ...

In the past, <PERSON> Medvene </PERSON> has contended his client is not a drug trafficker but a legitimate businessman and that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government has illegally detained him. <PERSON> Medvene </PERSON> has said <PERSON> Zuno </PERSON> merely had the misfortune of having a house that was sold to <PERSON> Caro </PERSON>, a reputed drug who allegedly masterminded <PERSON> Camerena </PERSON>'s murder in that house. <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON> and his pilot, <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Zavala </PERSON> <PERSON> Avelar </PERSON>, were killed after the agent led a series of raids on marijuana plantations allegedly operated by <PERSON> Caro </PERSON>. <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON>'s body was found March 5, 1985, on a ranch 65 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Guadalajara </LOCATION>.

 <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON>'s leftist rebels on Thursday announced a suspension to their economic sabotage campaign, and both rebels and government said they agreed in principle to meet soon in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> to try to end their civil war.

She said the development is a tribute to the resolve <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has shown in reaffirming continued <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid to <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> and for observance of human rights standards. <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION> leaders told a news conference in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> that rebel fighters will stop sabotaging telephone and electrical facilities and stop planting land mines and booby traps at midnight Sunday. `` The <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION> will maintain these unilateral measures during a sufficiently prudent time for the armed forces and the government to take corresponding steps that will contribute to creating a serious climate for negotiation,'' said a rebel communique read to the reporters. The leaders would not say what constitutes `` sufficiently prudent.'' The communique accused the government and its armed forces of bombing civilian areas; using mines and booby traps; arresting and torturing students, workers and other activists, and attacking journalists. It said this must stop and the government must suspend the draft and must allow the immediate, unrestricted return of all refugees. The communique said a positive government response would `` demonstrate a real will for peace.'' No immediate response came from the government. The <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION> has fought a series of U.S.-backed Salvadoran governments for nearly 10 years. The war has killed about 70,000 people, most of them civilian.

 <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> replaced the mayors of two towns with army officers in cocaine regions Thursday, but then rescinded its action after an outcry that the moves were unconstitutional and antidemocratic. The development was the latest wrinkle in this <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> country's fierce anti-narcotics campaign. Two bombs exploded Thursday in a pedestrian mall in the drug center of <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>, injuring two policemen. In <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>, cattle rancher <PERSON> Jaime </PERSON> <PERSON> Castillo </PERSON> <PERSON> Franco </PERSON> was shot to death Thursday by two men while driving in the capital. The killers sped away and it was not known if the shooting was related to the drug war. President <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> used emergency anti-drug decrees late Wednesday to name military officers to replace indefinitely the elected mayors of <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Boyaca </LOCATION> and Pacho, two towns believed to be strongholds of drug kingpins. <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Boyaca </LOCATION>, 95 miles north of <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>, has been a strongpoint for right-wing death squads the government says are controlled by cocaine cartels. The town is in a region believed rife with cocaine-processing laboratories. The government also replaced the mayor of Pacho, 40 northeast of the capital, saying it too is believed to be a strongpoint for drug cartels. But civil libertarians and politicians vehemently accused the government of exceeding its constitutional powers. Late Thursday, Interior Minister <PERSON> Orlando </PERSON> <PERSON> Velasquez </PERSON> canceled the moves because of `` accusations that we are acting anti-democratically.'' `` I will obey the order, but I do n't agree with it,'' <PERSON> Puerto </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyaca </PERSON>'s mayor, <PERSON> Marino </PERSON> <PERSON> Estrada </PERSON>, had told the <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caracol </ORGANIZATION>. `` They must have their reasons but I do n't know what they are. Everything has been calm here.'' The war between drug cartels and government broke out Aug. 18 when assassins believed to be paid by the drug lords killed the front-running presidential candidate, Sen. <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Galan </PERSON>, a strong foe of drug dealing. The private <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> chain and a police spokesman reported two bombs blew up in a crowded outdoor <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> mall, extensively damaging several shops. One bomb was left in a sports duffle bag under a table in a fast-food restaurant, police said. `` By luck, there were n't any more injuries,'' said the police spokesman, who spoke on condition of not being identified. Telephoned warnings of bombs placed in buildings in <LOCATION> Barranquilla </LOCATION> forced evacuation Thursday of several government offices and banks, including the <ORGANIZATION> Venezuelan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Caracol </ORGANIZATION> said. No bombs were found. In this capital, about 500 students at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bogota </ORGANIZATION>, shouting `` Gringos, go home!,'' burned a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> flag and threw stones at journalists. University officials evacuated the campus and suspended classes for the day. They said two students were slightly hurt. The protest came one day after the extradition to <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> of Colombian economist <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> <PERSON> Romero </PERSON>, 37, accused of being one of the main money launderers for the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cocaine cartel. Americans fled <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> on Thursday fearing a deadly backlash by the drug lords, who have said they would rather die in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> than live in prison in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and who have threatened to kill 10 judges for every Colombian drug suspect extradited. Shortly after <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>'s extradition, two men on a motorcycle tossed a dynamite bomb at a bank in <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>, 150 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>, causing $ 45,000 damage but no injuries, police there told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. Another bomb damaged a <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> warehouse Wednesday night, but police said that might have been an act of personal vengeance, not a drug reprisal. Along the 1,000-mile-long Venezuela-Colombia border, 12 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aircraft with sophisticated reconnaissance gear have begun overflights of the mountainous <LOCATION> Sierra </LOCATION> de Perija terrain, observers in <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> reported Thursday. The Indians living in the area said this week that drug smugglers maintain a vast, 60,000-acre coca plantation there. Cocaine is made from the coca leaf. <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s largest newspaper, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tiempo </LOCATION>, reported the crackdown forced closure of some cocaine laboratories. It predicted a cocaine shortage within a month in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which gets 80 percent of the drug from <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> began debating whether the draconian state of siege powers are legal. The opposition <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> called <ORGANIZATION> Barco </ORGANIZATION>'s decision to impose military rule on violence-plagued towns unconstitutional. Mayor <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> said as long as he is carrying out his legal duties, `` no one will remove me from this job.'' Among Americans leaving were 20 families of employees of U.S.-based <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which has been developing <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s largest oil field, a source said Thursday on condition of anonymity. He said they left Wednesday night. Three Americans playing on popular semi-pro basketball teams in <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> were also reported leaving. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON> <PERSON> Petteway </PERSON>, both of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, playing for the <ORGANIZATION> Banco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cafetero </ORGANIZATION> team, and <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Garrett </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, of the Sprite squad, `` are returning to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> right away,'' <PERSON> Jaime </PERSON> <PERSON> Arenas </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Colombian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Basketball </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION>, told the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION>. `` Unfortunately, we had to do this because of the violence affecting <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> and in particular <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION>.'' Senior <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomats and drug enforcement officials in <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> have said that once extraditions start, they expect drug-related terrorism in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> to increase. For years, drug traffickers have largely evaded justice through bribery and intimidation, killing or bribing politicians, police, judges, journalists and others. <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, who arrived in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> under heavy guard Thursday, has denied any links to the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cartel. He is accused of laundering up to $ 27 million in drug profits by funneling the cash through <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> banks, including one in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>.

 The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> has narrowly retained its parliamentary majority, suffering heavy losses to both anti-apartheid and segregationist rivals in its worst electoral showing in 41 years in power. But acting President F.W. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> said today that the results showed that most voters support the Nationalists' plan to extend limited political rights to blacks, who were barred from voting in Wednesday's election. With just two of 166 election districts undecided, it appeared the Nationalists would retain at least 93 of their previous 123 seats in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>'s dominant white chamber. The Conservatives, who want stricter enforcement of segregation laws, improved from 22 to 39 seats, and the liberal <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> from 20 to 33, making the biggest gains ever for an anti-apartheid faction. In protest of their disenfranchisement, blacks observed a nationwide general strike, which anti-apartheid leaders called the biggest anti-government protest ever with 3 million people taking part.

 Ultraviolet-B radiation, those sun rays that may cause skin cancer, can destroy a protein essential to plants, suggesting that ozone holes in the sky could lead to less food on the table, an agriculture scientist said Thursday. <PERSON> Autar </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mattoo </PERSON>, leader of the plant molecular biology laboratory at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> research station in <LOCATION> Beltsville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, said that studies using duckweed plants showed that exposure to ultraviolet-B, or UV-B, radiation destroyed half of the plant's store of a critical photosynthesis protein every half hour. The plant is able to restore protein at normal UV-B levels, he said, but at higher levels of UV-B the plant would be stripped of the protein and photosynthesis would stop. `` In a few hours time, you would have hardly any of this protein left in the plant,'' he said. `` The plant would wither away and die.''

 Lunchtime at Mulates: The friendly waitress serves up fried catfish, stuffed peppers and jambalaya to the tourist while the fiddle and accordion wail another chorus of `` Jolie Blonde.'' It may make the tourist commission here in the heart of <LOCATION> Acadiana </LOCATION> happy, but it has Trent Angers hotter than a cayenne pepper. `` That's exactly how a lot of people got their image of Cajuns. A reporter comes to town and he is sent to <LOCATION> Mulates </LOCATION> and on a swamp tour and then he heads off to write his story. Most people think we're a bunch of laid-back, drunken hedonists who eat too much and dance all night.'' Fun, food and music may be part of the Cajun heritage, but it's not the whole story, said Angers, author of `` The Truth About Cajuns. `` That does n't define who we are. Cajuns are a people with a strong work ethic, strong family ties and a fidelity to the land.'' In his book, Angers traces the history of the French exiles who moved from <LOCATION> Nova </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Scotia </LOCATION> in the mid-1700s and whose descendants kept many of their native customs, including the language, and became known as Acadians or Cajuns. Angers, 41, whose mother is Cajun, blames the media, tourism, counterfeit Cajun products and humorist <PERSON> Justin </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, whose `` Cajun Chef'' cooking show is nationally syndicated, for the Cajun stereotype. `` He speaks in broken English and with a lot of malaprops.

He is not a Cajun, but this is the only image of a live Cajun many people have. `` His contrived accent and the demeaning nature of many of his jokes are embarrassing to many people in south <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>. They just wish Mr. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> would go home and do his cooking instead of ridiculing them.'' <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> and his manager-wife <PERSON> Jeannine </PERSON> refused to even discuss the issue. `` I do n't want to talk about that,'' <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Joubert </PERSON>, a Cajun and a sociologist at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Louisiana </ORGANIZATION>, said Angers' book makes some valid points. `` To see some of it you would think we all have pirogues still and are barefoot and are living in a swamp. There's the implication that these people do n't know any better but they're happy because they dance a lot,'' he said. Working from national publications, Angers compiled a list of stereotypes. For example: _ `` What lives in the swamps, plays an accordion, eats crawfish, speaks French and rocks your socks off?'' _ `` In these parts, if you do n't dance and drink beer, people think you're a communist!'' _ `` Cajun country -LRB- is -RRB- a land of fiddles and etouffee, squeeze boxes and two-steps ... where everybody's a cousin and everything's cooked in cayenne by a people whose religion is hospitality. <PERSON> Alice </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferguson </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> Lafayette </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Visitors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, denied tourism officials have helped to generate such stereotypes. `` When a writer or film crew comes in, they sometimes only want to see a swamp or Cajun dancing or one part of the culture,'' she said. `` We try to make sure they get what they want. If they do n't have a specific request, we try to show them some of everything _ the museums, the city, the university, as well as the swamp and the dancing.'' Even Cajun food has been slandered, Angers said, accusing national writers and cooks for erroneously labeling it hot and peppery. `` To read about Cajun food or taste so-called Cajun food like Cajun potato chips, or Cajun Whalers at Burger King, or the Cajun Pizza at Pizza Hut, you'd think Cajuns had to drink a lot of beer just to preserve their taste buds. Cajun food is about the only thing that has been more maligned here than the people.'' His definition of Cajun food is good home cooking made with fresh ingredients and skill. Some may be spicy, but it's not hot or peppery. While Cajuns have managed to maintain a cultural identity, they are not a group of simple people living in the past, Angers said. `` It may be good for tourism, but it undermines the dignity of the Cajun people.'' And it is good for tourism. Although <PERSON> Ferguson </PERSON> has no figures on how many people visit the area annually, she said the four major festivals in <LOCATION> Lafayette </LOCATION> each draw 200,000 to 300,000 people. Although 8 percent to 10 percent of the Cajuns still hunt, trap and live in the swamps, Angers said the majority are mainstream Americans these days. `` Because of the fact we're projected as good-time Charlies, people who are in a position to bring industry into this state do n't even give this area a thought They assume we are so busy playing that we do n't ever work.'' Angers, who also is the editor and publisher of the magazine <ORGANIZATION> Acadiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Profile </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` I do n't want to go overboard in the other direction and make Cajuns seem like boring, humorless people who never have fun. But come on, you could n't do to another minority what people have done to Cajuns and get away with it. `` All I'm saying is there is more to us than a group of dull-witted, beer drinking musicians. Let's have a little balance from now on.''

<HEAD>The Green Man Returns: Pagan Figure on London Subway</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Green Man is back, staring at travelers from posters in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> subway stations. The mysterious and arresting image of a face with sprouting leaves is older than Christianity, harking back to pagan times when the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>, the sun and all living things were believed to have spirits. There have been many types of Green Man. This one was carved in the 14th or 15th century in the ceiling of <LOCATION> Norwich </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cathedral </LOCATION>, 115 miles northeast of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. He is on a poster for an exhibition called `` Out of the Wood: the Tree as Image and Symbol,'' about the relationship between trees and the arts. It features mainly contemporary wood carvings and ornaments and ceramics based on the shapes of trees and leaves, and poems about trees. `` It was an inspired choice to put the Green Man on the poster because we have had a steady stream of visitors all day since we opened on Aug. 2,'' said <PERSON> Julia </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, who helps run the exhibition in the <ORGANIZATION> Crafts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gallery </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Waterloo </LOCATION> Place near Piccadilly Circus. <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Clifford </PERSON>, a former landscape planner also involved with the exhibition, said in an interview: `` The Green Man seems to have had a lot of uses before he was taken over by Christians and then discarded. In his simplest version he was the spirit of regeneration, the spirit of the forest. He was a giant garlanded in green, sometimes frightening, sometimes benign.'' <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, a writer and poet and author of a forthcoming book on the Green Man, said the figure can be seen in medieval churches and cathedrals throughout <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. At times, these days, he can be seen in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> as a pub sign. `` But his origins are much more ancient than the Middle Ages. He is one of those symbols that appear and disappear in history,'' the writer said. `` The Green Man may be the origin of a folk cult figure known as <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> in the Green or <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> of the Wood, and it was <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> who may have inspired the legend of <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hood </PERSON> and his merry men in <LOCATION> Sherwood </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Forest </LOCATION>.'' The gallery is a showplace for contemporary arts and crafts but hardly a tourist attraction and does n't usually get many visitors on hot days. `` But we had TV and radio interviews and good notices in the papers because the <PERSON> Green </PERSON> <PERSON> Man </PERSON> is so striking,'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said. The version of the poster Green Man is based on the drawing still high up in the cathedral, but the exhibition offers a modern Green Man, made of gently flickering neon tubes by <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON>. The idea of a visible spirit of the trees is repeated in other exhibits. `` Gold Jacket'' by <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Wincer </PERSON>, priced at $ 3,100, is a dark coat covered with real oak leaves that were preserved with resin and painted gold. `` I thought of oak leaves because I wanted to do something very English,'' said <PERSON> Wincer </PERSON>. Oak forests dotted <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> centuries ago and provided the timber for homes, farms and ships.

<HEAD>Classic Neapolitan Song Gets Rock 'n' Roll Revival</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARY BETH SHERIDAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>FORMIA, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Pino </PERSON> <PERSON> Daniele </PERSON> grew up steeped in traditional Neapolitan music, the sometimes mournful, sometimes joyous melodies passed down for centuries in this <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> city. But it did n't stop him from wanting to be <PERSON> Elvis </PERSON>. `` I loved rock' n' roll but I also loved my music, Neapolitan,'' says the 34-year-old singer. `` I am a big fan of <PERSON> Elvis </PERSON> <PERSON> Presley </PERSON>, and at the same time I'm a big fan of -LRB- Neapolitan crooner -RRB- <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Murolo </PERSON>.'' Today, <PERSON> Daniele </PERSON> is leading a revival of the Neapolitan song, which made Italian music world-famous with such tunes as `` O Sole Mio,'' `` Funiculi, Funicula'' and `` Turna a Surriento'' -LRB- `` Return to Sorrento'' -RRB-. But instead of mandolins, it is electric guitars and a rock or jazz rhythm that mark the new Neapolitan sound. <PERSON> Daniele </PERSON>'s albums have won him huge audiences and encouraged a whole school of Neapolitan singers at a time when Italian performers account for less than half the record sales in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> while <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> and British singers dominate the pop charts. `` Neapolitan song represents one of the main points of Italian culture. We members of the new generation said, ` let's create a fusion,''' explained <PERSON> Daniele </PERSON> in an interview at his studio in <LOCATION> Formia </LOCATION>, 50 miles from <LOCATION> Naples </LOCATION>. `` That is, we fuse it -LRB- Neapolitan song -RRB- with modern music, a universal language, which could be jazz or rock or other kinds of music.'' With a faded T-shirt covering his husky frame, his gray-streaked black hair pulled back in a ponytail, there is no mistaking <PERSON> Daniele </PERSON> for <PERSON> Enrico </PERSON> <PERSON> Caruso </PERSON>. But he does claim a number of other similarities with his Neapolitan predecessors. Like them, <PERSON> Daniele </PERSON> sings about the sea, the sultry Mediterranean afternoons, the plight of the city's poor. He places special emphasis on melody, like past Neapolitans whose songs are still played in Italian restaurants the world over. And he uses the local dialect, which is laced with French and Spanish from <LOCATION> Naples </LOCATION>' colonial past and English from the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> soldiers based in the area since World War II. In <PERSON> Daniele </PERSON>'s songs, the tradition is mixed with a rock or Afro-Cuban beat _ something that startled people when he first began playing it in the mid-1970s. `` It was something new, but it communicated emotion,'' said the musician. `` This is the important thing in the end.'' Indeed, crowds frequently join in an emotional chorus with <PERSON> Daniele </PERSON>, particularly for his older ballads such as `` Napule e'' -LRB- `` Naples Is'' -RRB- and `` <LOCATION> Terra </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mia </LOCATION>'' -LRB- `` My Land'' -RRB- about the corruption and neglect that have scarred <LOCATION> Naples </LOCATION>. His success has helped fuel a boom in Neapolitan pop music, featuring singers <PERSON> Edoardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennato </PERSON>, <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON> <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Sio </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Esposito </PERSON>. A Neapolitan, <PERSON> Massimo </PERSON> <PERSON> Ranieri </PERSON>, won the Italian national song contest `` <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Remo </LOCATION>'' last year with a new Neapolitan ballad, `` Perdere L'Amore'' -LRB- `` Losing Love'' -RRB-. <PERSON> Daniele </PERSON>'s songs aim to bring together not only Italian and American music, but the experience of the poor in the two countries. `` They're Neapolitan melodies but with the rhythm of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> blacks,'' explains <PERSON> Gianni </PERSON> <PERSON> Borgna </PERSON>, author of `` History of Italian Song.'' `` <PERSON> Daniele </PERSON> suggests the poor of <LOCATION> Naples </LOCATION> are a bit like American blacks, not so different from outcasts in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' The modern tunes are a long way from traditional Neapolitan song, which was influenced by arias in <LOCATION> Donizetti </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Rossini </PERSON> operas, as well as French and Spanish traditions. <PERSON> Daniele </PERSON> heard those songs while growing up as one of six children of a <LOCATION> Naples </LOCATION> port worker. As he taught himself to play the guitar in his teens, he also followed singers such as <PERSON> Peppino </PERSON> di Capri who were beginning to adapt Neapolitan melodies to a nightclub style. In recent years, <PERSON> Daniele </PERSON> has increasingly worked with <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> and Latin American musicians to experiment with other influences and establish broader appeal for his music. `` We are trying to develop this to get into the international market, which is very difficult,'' he said. `` If you do n't sing in English, you're out automatically.'' He hopes nonetheless to win broader success with a `` Mediterranean'' sound, featuring Neapolitan melody, Latin and blues rhythms and perhaps an English singer. While he is not an international superstar, his reputation has spread in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. He has given concerts in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. In January, he will head for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for a concert series called `` Night of the Guitar,'' in which he will play instrumentals with guitarists including <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> West </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Robby </PERSON> <PERSON> Krieger </PERSON> of the Doors. <PERSON> Daniele </PERSON> says with the international contacts, his songs have developed a more modern sound. `` But they always have a reference to the Neapolitan way of communicating,'' he insisted. `` There's always that.''

<DATELINE>TINGO MARIA, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 American narcotics agents, trained in tropical combat and armed with automatic weapons, are preparing to move into a heavily fortified police garrison built with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> funds in the heart of <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s coca-rich jungle. The base at <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lucia </LOCATION>, 65 miles northwest of here, is part of a major offensive by the Peruvian government against drug gangs and their allies _ dogmatic Maoist guerrillas who call themselves the Shining Path and control much of the lush <LOCATION> Upper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Huallaga </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> on the eastern slopes of the Andes. Despite the danger posed by the guerrilla force, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is making the campaign in <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> the centerpiece of its drive against cocaine trafficking in the Andean nations, which supply the coca leaf from which the drug is refined. The plans were drawn before President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> outlined his $ 7.9-billion drug program Sept. 5. `` Sixty to 70 percent of the world's coca production comes out of here,'' said <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Chretien </PERSON>, chief of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>'s operations in <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>. `` <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>, of all the countries, offers the best opportunity to do significant damage to the coca trade.'' Once the anti-drug base is completed in October, as many as 50 Americans will operate directly from the <LOCATION> Upper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Huallaga </LOCATION> region, providing training and air support to some 300 police rangers assigned to the garrison. The Americans include <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> agents and contracted <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> War veterans who fly and maintain the nine <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> helicopters and two C-123 cargo planes currently on loan to <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> for the anti-drug fight. `` The base is strategically located near all of the most important trafficking areas,'' said Gen. <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Zarate </PERSON>, chief of <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s drug police. The compound will have a three-quarter-mile airstrip that can accommodate C-130 cargo planes, three helicopter pads, and nine buildings, mainly barracks. The 100-acre area will be enclosed by barbed wire and the outlying perimeter will be protected by mines. The step-up in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> involvement comes as the Peruvian army, armed with recently acquired Soviet armored helicopters, has launched its heaviest campaign so far in the valley against the <ORGANIZATION> Shining </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Path </ORGANIZATION> _ `` Sendero Luminoso'' in Spanish. The escalation in the fighting in the valley, however, has aroused the concern of the <ORGANIZATION> Andean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jurists </ORGANIZATION>, among others, that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> could be drawn into the war against the guerrillas. The commission, affliated with the Andean Pact alliance of <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>, noted recently that while the base is intended for the drug fight, `` observers are concerned that in the medium term it can be converted into a springboard for the internationalization of the counterinsurgency fight in <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>.'' The <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> agents came to <LOCATION> Tingo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Maria </LOCATION>, about 250 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s capital, in search of cocaine traffickers. But they have found themselves in the middle of a revolution and working in a valley dominated by at least 2,500 guerrillas. `` It's probably the most hostile situation the <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> works in anywhere,'' <PERSON> Chretien </PERSON> said in an interview in <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>. Earlier this year the <ORGANIZATION> Shining </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Path </ORGANIZATION> offered a $ 50,000 reward for any <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> agent killed in the valley, according to the Rev. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Feeley </PERSON>, a Canadian Roman Catholic priest working in <LOCATION> Aucayacu </LOCATION>, a town 35 miles north of <LOCATION> Tingo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Maria </LOCATION>. `` The <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> has become a dirty word in the <LOCATION> Huallaga </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` Sendero, and most other people around here, too, see the <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> as being anti-subversive, not just anti-drug.'' In return for providing protection from police raids, the Shining Path enjoys the support of tens of thousands of peasants who grow coca in the valley, earning 10 times what they could from other crops. The guerrillas collect a 10 to 15 percent `` tax'' from the growers as well as charging Colombian traffickers $ 10,000 to $ 15,000 for each small plane that picks up cocaine paste for refining in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, according to the peasants and police. Houses along the Jungle Highway leading out of <LOCATION> Tingo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Maria </LOCATION>, the largest town in the valley, are scrawled in blood-red paint with deadly messages for the <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION>. One on a school building said: `` Get out, <ORGANIZATION> Yankees </ORGANIZATION>, while you can _ you will find your tombs here.'' The <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> is not permitted to take part in counterinsurgency wars. But in practice that changed in <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> when it became clear two years ago that the guerrillas were actively involved in the cocaine trade. `` The rule is that Sendero is fair game if they're trafficking in drugs,'' <PERSON> Chretien </PERSON> said. `` What counts is if they're traffickers, not their politics. That does n't mean we go looking for guerrilla camps or columns. But if we spot them from the air, we notify the police. And if they attack us, we defend ourselves.'' The <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> pulled out of this ramshackle settlement in a hurry in April after a force of 200 rebels, aided by local drug gangs and Colombian traffickers, overran a police post in <LOCATION> Uchiza </LOCATION>, a town a few miles from <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lucia </LOCATION>, killing 10 policemen. Three of them were officers who were executed publicly in the town plaza after the garrison ran out of ammunition. `` <LOCATION> Tingo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Maria </LOCATION> is n't a healthy place if you're an American,'' said a <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> agent. `` There's a Sendero committee on every block, every block.'' <LOCATION> Tingo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Maria </LOCATION>, at the southern end of the narrow, 150-mile-long valley, has the look of a town expecting an attack at any moment. Nervous troops behind sandbag barricades guard the bridge over the river to the town's airstrip. Villagers say the Shining Path now moves boldly through the valley, in columns of up to 500 fighters. The rebels wear uniforms of black T-shirts and khaki pants, forsaking the clothing of the Peruvian peasantry that would allow them to fade into the civilian populace. In response, the army has begun employing its Soviet helicopters, known as `` flying tanks'' and armed with heavy-caliber machine guns and rockets. In July the armed forces reported killing 210 rebels, 110 of them in three air and land battles over a two-day period in the valley. `` It's getting to the point where there are going to be full-scale battles between two strong forces,'' said <PERSON> Feeley </PERSON>, the Canadian priest. Making use recently of four of the MI-25 helicopters, the army strafed guerrilla columns and at least one village of peasants considered to be Shining Path supporters. Human rights groups fear that the casualty tolls provided by the army may include many civilians. <PERSON> Feeley </PERSON> said that 17 suspected Shining Path leaders detained by the army in late July in <LOCATION> Aucayacu </LOCATION> `` are now on that long list of disappeared people.'' But the guerrillas have taken their own toll. In June three Shining Path assassins walked into the office of <LOCATION> Tingo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Maria </LOCATION>'s popular mayor, <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Espinosa </PERSON>, and shot him to death as he sat behind his desk. In <LOCATION> Aucayacu </LOCATION>, the Shining Path has assassinated four of the last six mayors. `` The other two quit before they were killed,'' said <PERSON> Feeley </PERSON>.

<DATELINE>AUCAYACU, Peru (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Maoist Shining Path guerrillas who dominate <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Upper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Huallaga </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> have brought their own law and order to a cocaine-corrupted, violence-ridden region. With a system they call `` revolutionary justice,'' they have banned drug abuse, prostitution, homosexuality and thievery from the villages they control. `` Two years ago you could not travel the roads without being held up, but the ` companeros' put an end to that,'' said cab driver <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Nicolas </PERSON>, referring to the guerrillas by the Spanish term for comrades. `` They killed a few bandits and the rest got the message.'' Much of the appeal of the rebels is rooted in their reputation for almost puritanical honesty. Shopkeepers say the guerrillas never fail to pay for the food and supplies they acquire in the villages. The same shopkeepers complain bitterly about the local police who take what they want without ever offering to pay. In a rare conversation with reporters, a Shining Path political officer, who spoke only on condition he not be identified, gave an example of the kind of law the guerrillas have laid down: `` Do not steal so much as a needle or thread and return what you borrow.'' In a nation where economic chaos reigns and few laws are respected, the Shining Path is setting down clear rules and making them stick. `` In a sense they enforce a hyper-Christian morality _ except they kill you if you break the rules,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Feeley </PERSON>, a Canadian Roman Catholic priest working in <LOCATION> Aucayacu </LOCATION>, 255 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>. In late July four young homosexual men who rendezvoused at a bridge a few miles outside <LOCATION> Tingo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Maria </LOCATION>, 35 miles south of here, were set upon and killed by the rebels. Their bodies were dumped into the river. A few months earlier the rebels executed eight youths near <LOCATION> Tingo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Maria </LOCATION> for smoking cigarettes laced with semi-refined cocaine. `` People have had to discipline themselves,'' said <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Aranda </PERSON>, an agronomist in <LOCATION> Tingo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Maria </LOCATION>, explaining the effects of `` revolutionary justice.'' `` In rural areas a man must be faithful to his wife and is permitted to go drinking only once a week. Violators are warned only once.'' Villagers say they are told, `` The revolution has a thousand eyes and a thousand ears.'' <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>'s elected officials have painted the Shining Path insurgents as lunatic killers. In the bleak Andean highlands, where the rebels launched their insurgency in May, 1980, they have slain thousands of peasants in attacks on villages they viewed as traitors to the rebel cause. But here in the jungle-cloaked <LOCATION> Upper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Huallaga </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, the world's largest source of coca leaf, the <ORGANIZATION> Shining </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Path </ORGANIZATION> _ `` Sendero Luminoso'' in <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> _ enjoys the support of tens of thousands of farmers because the rebels protect them against a U.S.-funded coca eradication program Although they prohibit drug consumption, the guerrillas defend coca production as an important source of income for the peasants. Their only condition is that the semi-refined coca paste be sent out of <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>. The rebels charge coca farmers a `` tax'' of 10 to 15 percent on the earnings from the sale of their crops to drug traffickers, who process the leaf into paste and sell it to Colombian cocaine dealers. The Colombians arrive in small planes at dozens of clandestine airstrips throughout the 150-mile-long valley. People in the <LOCATION> Upper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Huallaga </LOCATION> appear to accept Shining Path's social order They say they feel protected from the violence of drug gangs, corrupt local officials and `` abusive'' police. `` Why do you think people have joined the Shining Path? For the coca and for revenge,'' said <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferrer </PERSON>, a taxi driver who travels the road between <LOCATION> Tingo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Maria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Aucayacu </LOCATION>. `` When the government began trying to wipe out coca, police came and mistreated people. They robbed peasants; they raped their women.'' That view of the police as corrupt and abusive of their power is widely held in the valley. Even top government officials in <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION> say there is much truth to the complaints. `` A cop in the <LOCATION> Huallaga </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> expects to be bribed,'' said a senior <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> official, speaking on condition of anonymity. `` He figures it's a right coming to him. He gets off the plane from <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION> with his hand out for a payoff.'' Official corruption is a problem throughout <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>, but in the <LOCATION> Huallaga </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> it seems rampant. A half dozen peasants complained in separate interviews that to obtain a farm loan from the local <ORGANIZATION> Banco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agrario </ORGANIZATION> they have to kick back 25 percent of the loan to bank officials. `` What I've heard is that if you want to be named a teacher in the valley,'' said <PERSON> Feeley </PERSON>, `` it's three months salary as payment. And if you're a woman, also the bed.'' The Shining Path has been quick to kill local officials they deemed to be corrupt, according to residents of the valley. `` If the Shining Path has the image of an organization that's fighting corruption in a very corrupt place, that's going to win them some points,'' <PERSON> Feeley </PERSON> said A lawyer in Tingo <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> said his caseload had dropped off dramatically because peasants no longer come into town to seek justice. `` Formal justice here is ineffective, corrupt and time consuming,'' he said. `` The Shining Path's justice is quick, free and very effective.''

 <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> makes no attempt to conceal he's the son of a well-known takeover strategist _ on one wall of his office hangs a caricature of his father in pursuit of <ORGANIZATION> Phillips </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. But said the youngest son of <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boone </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>: `` I always had a real independent streak.'' <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON>, 32, is chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Catalyst </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York-based </LOCATION> power producer he bought in August 1988, using his own money and capital from a Canadian company, <ORGANIZATION> Great </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lakes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> said he did not ask his father, who heads the <ORGANIZATION> Mesa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Limited </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partnership </ORGANIZATION> oil concern in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, to contribute toward the purchase. He did not need <PERSON> Boone </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON>' money or his reputation _ by the time he bought Catalyst, <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> already had founded and sold a business and tried his hand at other investments, including hostile takeover attempts like those his father has become famous for. The younger <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> _ his full name is <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Boone </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> _ began trading a stock portfolio when he was 14. In his senior year at <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> he started a company that distributed computer components. The company's sales went from zero to $ 10 million in about 2 -LCB- years before he sold it, and then <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> went into what he called `` small venture capital-type companies.'' But about 1985, <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> said, he found that business had become `` pretty risky and a very difficult way to build a portfolio of operating companies.'' He sought a more stable operation, something he believed Catalyst would be. Catalyst was attractive, <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> said, because `` independent power is on the leading edge of the energy business and I look for consistent forms of cash flow, which it can bring.'' <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> said he expects to expand the privately held company _ which has $ 1 billion in assets and annual sales of $ 460 million _ through acquisitions. The firm's projects include a $ 500 million floating power plant, the <LOCATION> Merrimac </LOCATION>, recently towed up the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> to be part of a hyroelectric project that Catalyst partly owns. In 1987, <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON>' made his first hostile takeover attempt, when a group he led bid for <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a mutual fund that escaped the advance. <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON>' group later made a $ 106 million offer for the <ORGANIZATION> Richmond </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, but sold its stake in the bank when a higher bidder emerged. The group also made a run at another mutual fund, Clemente Global Growth Fund, but was stymied when a federal judge blocked the offer. <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> said he looks for `` whatever's the cheapest way to acquire a corporation ... whatever's the most efficient form.'' Under the right circumstances, that can mean a tender offer, or a direct appeal to shareholders for their stock, regardless of what the company's management wants. Tender offers made <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON>' father unwelcome in the boardrooms of major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> oil companies. Besides <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>, <PERSON> Boone </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> pursued <ORGANIZATION> Unocal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and a number of smaller firms. Although he never succeeded in taking one over, the elder <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> profited handsomely from his attempts and embodied the emergence of the corporate raider as both a feared and admired symbol of business power in the 1980s. Learning about business and investment was a natural part of growing up in <PERSON> Boone </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON>' home. `` It was always around,'' said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON>, whose blond, blue-eyed boyish looks make him appear much younger than 32. He held jobs typical for a teen-ager in high school and college, working in a photo lab and liquor store and operating a forklift for International Paper _ and in the process got training on how a manager should treat employees. `` I worked for a lot of jerks,'' he said. `` I know what kind of special talent it is to be a jerk, having worked for those guys, and I also know the way around it.'' `` I know the way that I would like to be treated in order to give 100 percent and that is how I treat my people,'' he said. <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> worked briefly for <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION>, including a stint in the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> after he graduated high school, but joining the company full-time was never an option. `` Dad's really big on the whole idea of efficient management, professional management,'' he said. `` I did n't really realize that a lot of public companies hire the siblings or hire the sons and daughters -LRB- of managers -RRB- _ I was always under the impression that that was not acceptable.'' A career at <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION> was also out of the question because `` I did n't like the feeling of it, going in there and being ` daddy's boy,''' <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> said `` If I messed up, I wanted somebody to tell me, just like they would tell everyone else ... I was n't getting honest opinions.'' His independence also led him along his own career path, but it has not stopped him from doing business with his father. <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> also chairs the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> chapter of his father's advocacy group, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shareholders </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. He acknowledged there are similarities between his outlook and his father's: `` Any time that you have a relationship like the one that my father and I have shared throughout the years, I think that there's going to be a certain amount of sharing of attitudes as well.'' He said their management styles differ in some ways but `` I have a great deal of respect for the time and the effort and the consideration that he has spent'' on <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION> and its employees. `` He motivates them very well and he compensates them very well and he makes sure they are part of a very close-knit family,'' he said. <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON> has similar goals for his 800 employees at Catalyst. `` We're trying to be sure that the people here are very proud to be in the position they're in,'' he said.

 <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> sees his job as White House chief of staff as something more than Oval Office doorkeeper _ but something `` not as hectic'' as, say, being chief executive of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hamsphire </LOCATION>. `` There's less pressure to work with each and every department and agency,'' <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> says. `` Here a lot is ... rightly or wrongly, under the control of the bureaucrats.'' <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>'s approach to the job differs from those of his predecessors under <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, for example, called it `` a great big catcher's mitt.'' To <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Regan </PERSON>, it was `` a shovel brigade that follows a parade down Main Street.'' But <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>, 50, the abrasive three-term <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> governor who was one of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s earliest campaign workers, may still be one of the surprise acts of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> White House. Originally an outsider to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> politics, <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> eight months into the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> presidency is not only proving himself adept at survival but has been winning allies in an institution where critics originally thought he would make only enemies, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` I've tried very hard to make every day a learning day,'' <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> said in an interview. After an admittedly rocky start that included the failed nomination of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> for <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION> secretary, <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> says he has been working hard to keep lines of communication open with members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and with the bureaucracy, and in keeping his fabled temper in check. And were there mistakes to learn from? `` Lots. And I'm not going to tell you any of them.'' <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>, one of the first aides <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> sees each morning at the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and the last one he meets with at the end of each day, says one of his principal jobs is `` just to make sure that everybody that the president should see gets a chance to see him.'' Blunt and quick-witted -LRB- he is a member of the high-IQ society, Mensa -RRB-, <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> handles the No. 1 staff job differently than the three men who held it before him. He is less of a behind-the-scenes negotiator and conciliator than were either <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s first staff chief and now the secretary of state, or former <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s third staff chief. Where <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> has been credited with moderating some of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s more conservative views, <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> is the in-house conservative in the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> White House. <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> has been criticized by some for maintaining too high a profile compared to the low-key and generally soft-spoken <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>. But while he exercises firm control over the staff, <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> does not exert the iron discipline that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s middle chief of staff, <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Regan </PERSON>, did; nor does he attempt to maintain the same degree of control over the president's personal schedule, according to White House insiders. Some White House staffers have privately criticized <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> for appearing at <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s side so often. Still, <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> said, `` I can wander in to any meeting, any time. He -LRB- <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> -RRB- wants it that way.'' <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> <PERSON> Eizenstat </PERSON>, a former senior aide to President <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> and now a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> lawyer and consultant, says <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> `` seems to have subdued his own personal agenda for the president's agenda, and seems to have achieved a sense of teamwork.'' <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Griscom </PERSON>, a former aide in the <ORGANIZATION> Reagan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, which was rife with staff clashes, said <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> `` has exceeded expectations. There are still many tests out there. But, so far, people have to acknowledge that Gov. <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> knows his way around more than people gave him credit for.'' While <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> made an early peace with <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Republican Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> -LRB- something <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> was unable to do -RRB- in an effort salve bitterness remaining from the 1988 presidential primaries, he has n't completely retired the hatchet he wielded for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> during the presidential campaign. A favorite target has been Sen. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Biden </PERSON>, D-Del., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> which earlier this month dumped <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s nomination of <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> to head the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s civil rights `` Sen. <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> is out there, to be blunt about it, trashing the president,'' <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> says. But the chief of staff also has another role, one not often seen by the public _ that of White House jester. When <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> stepped away from an Oval Office meeting briefly, <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> impishly had a White House photographer snap a picture of the empty presidential chair as he and other top aides looked on intently. <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> and national security adviser <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON> then presented an autographed enlargement to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. It was inscribed to `` President Skippy,'' from a staff `` who can see through you,'' a clear reference to cartoonist G.B. <PERSON> Trudeau </PERSON>'s long-running `` Doonesbury'' depiction of him as an invisible leader with a fictitious `` evil twin'' brother, Skippy `` It was in the middle of a tough week,'' <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> said. `` People feel comfortable doing something that breaks the tension a little bit. I think it allows for a decision to be made in a much more relaxed climate. And you usually end up with better decisions.'' Then there was the time he talked Budget Director <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> into donning a gorilla suit to greet the president. Or when the staff turned the tables and all showed up at a meeting wearing black arm bands to mark <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>'s 50th birthday. The bespectacled, round-faced aide staff chief claims he's gotten a bad rap in the image department: that the perception of him as arrogant, imperious and aggressive is all wrong. `` What a lot of people miss was that ... I was governor in a state in which, constitutionally and statutorily, the governor's office was relatively weak. Running <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, he said, was in some ways much harder than running the White House staff. `` The pace down here is not as hectic,'' he said. What <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> lacked in legal authority in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, he made up for in swagger and bravado. Then he brought the same aggressiveness to managing <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s come-from-behind victory in the 1988 <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION> primary _ and to his travels around the country trashing neighboring Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. `` That was before his kinder and gentler days,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the other day in <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, in discussing his chief of staff. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> `` has my full, unequivocal confidence. And it makes life a lot easier for me. ... He's made a lot of friends for our administration on the basis of competence, sheer competence.'' Still, while staff morale seems generally high, there have been some clashes even in this `` kinder and gentler'' White House, including friction between <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> and Scowcroft whenever the chief of staff wanders into the foreign-policy domain, according to <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> sources. And while staff members say that <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> exhibits a sense of humor, he is not one to cross. As <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Card </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, a key <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> deputy and former <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> legislator, puts it: `` He expects people to have done their homework.''

<HEAD>Bennett's New Job Could Position Him Well for 1990s</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 When <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> decided that there should be a drug czar, the Democrats may not have bargained on getting <PERSON> Czar </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>. After the war on drugs, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> could be a formidable figure in the political wars of the 1990s. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, now 46, will come away from his current assignment as one of the most visible figures in the Republican lineup. His ample ambitions are directed at government service, as he demonstrated by volunteering for the drug job after a brief, lucrative season away from the federal payroll. This might have been a million-dollar year for <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> as a writer and speechmaker. He was heading in that direction at $ 14,000 a speech, plus book advances. As director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy, he makes $ 99,500. And, as he once observed, the hours are bad, the subject depressing. Add the fact that there's anything but a guarantee of success. Critics are saying President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s drug strategy is old stuff, underfinanced and unlikely to succeed. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> denies the first two complaints and dismisses the third as political pessimism. The voters want something done about drugs. They probably will punish failure, if they can figure out whom to blame. So far that has n't happened, but now there is a yardstick: the goals <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> set for the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> drug strategy. It calls for a 10 percent reduction in drug use by Labor Day, 1991. The administration also seeks to cut crack use by addicts in half. Those clear and specific goals come due one year before the next presidential election campaign. The <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> blueprint does provide a line of political insurance, saying that the goals are realistically achievable only with full federal, state and local implementation of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> plan. Should they come up short, the Republicans can argue that they did n't get that kind of top-to-bottom action. The drug job is at best a risky political assignment. But <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> has dealt with risks before. He made his national reputation as <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s secretary of education, running an agency the president once said he would eliminate. Near the end of his tour there, <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> told a congressional critic that `` largely because of me'' it was likely the education slot would stay in the Cabinet. `` I made a hell of a commitment,'' he said at a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> hearing, storming back at a liberal Republican who complained about budget cuts. `` You just did n't like the direction. I was damn successful.'' So far, the debate over the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> drug program has been restrained and polite. But there will be some shouting before it's over. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> is not given to low-profile operations. He made a point and angered a Democrat last spring by refusing to show up for a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> hearing called by Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>'s explanation: with 74 congressional committees claiming some piece of the drug program, he could n't spend his time at their hearings or he'd never get the plan finished Now that it's done, he will be the chief salesman, in speeches, television appearances, and at hearing after hearing before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> has more than a dozen dates for congressional testimony this month, before panels run by Democrats who complain that there's not enough money in the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> program. He has a script ready for them: `` I'm just not going to be all that receptive to criticism of $ 8 billion from people whose current mark is $ 6 billion. They're just not going to get away with that.'' By <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>'s reckoning, nobody should be surprised at the political side of the drug program debate. `` You ca n't get politics out of politics,'' he said. In mock surprise, he said that since <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s drug speech, `` political acts have been committed in this city.'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> committed some himself. `` For a couple of months, I have been criticized by some for emphasizing law enforcement and judges and prosecutors,'' he said in one of three almost simultaneous and almost identical television interviews the morning after the drug speech. `` This goes on for quite some time. And then I go to bed last night, realizing that <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Biden </PERSON>, speaking for the Democrats, has moved to my right, saying that we need more prosecutors, more law enforcement.'' <PERSON> Biden </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, was an architect of the bill that created <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>'s position and required the new drug strategy. While there are political risks ahead, there also are potential rewards, so the Democrats do n't want their role forgotten. <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> said the reason <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> made the drug speech in the first place was the law written in 1988. `` That's why the president was on TV,'' he said. `` He's required by law to lay that strategy out for the first time in our history.''

<HEAD>Drugs in America: The Enemy Within</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 This time, <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> can not simply come home. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> speaks determinedly of victory, but the fact remains, a generation after <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is losing its second war. Again the carnage, the brutality and the futility radiate nightly into living rooms across the land. The scenes seem so familiar. The dead being carried off in body bags. Wives and mothers grieving over senseless loss. Bewildered children, ravaged by violence and disease. Commandos in flak jackets charging again and again into enemy havens, only to find them quickly reoccupied. This time, the homefolks are not seeing these things just on television. No matter how sickened, they can not demand that the politicians and the generals return their sons and daughters from some faraway combat zone. Because home is where the war is. Guerrillas are roaming the streets, not of <LOCATION> Saigon </LOCATION>, but of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Not the jungles of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, but the farmlands of <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, like every president of the modern era, has promised to win the drug war. It will happen, he said Tuesday, `` block by block, child by child.'' He has a new program, latest in a long line. In eight previous years, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, by his own account, was the hands-on administrator of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s drug war. Polls show most people believe that effort failed. According to the <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, crack cocaine has become `` the fast food of drugs'' and has spread from just three <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cities eight years ago to virtually every state, including rural areas, `` now manifesting itself in all strata of society.'' Not a happy legacy for the crime-fighting Reagan-Bush administration. Now, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would channel $ 261 million into <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> and other Andean nations to help finance the hunt for drug kingpins and their henchmen, for whom human life is cheaper than a coca leaf. Meanwhile, <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s drug users are spending an estimated $ 100 billion each year to keep them in business. To this day, some Americans affix exclusive blame to foreign villains, be they Colombian drug lords, corrupt Third-World generals or Jamaican immigrants. A recent poll suggests a majority of the public would favor the use of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops to wipe out the drug exporting centers around the globe. Others argue that supply only exists to satisfy demand, and speak boldly of mandatory prison terms or hospital confinement for all drug abusers, as if there were room for them all. There is n't. According to the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION>, 72 million Americans, or a whopping 37 percent of the population aged 12 or older, have used illegal drugs at least once in their lifetime. An estimated 14.5 million people had used them within a month of the federally sponsored <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Household </ORGANIZATION> Survey on Drug Abuse last year. An estimated 21 million Americans have tried cocaine, at least 3 million are still occasional users and nearly a million are heavy users. About 28 million people used one banned drug or another, counting marijuana, in the last year. Drugs favor no race, sex or class. Three-fourths of illicit drug users are white; 41 percent are women, including 5 million of child-bearing age. The drug education council says 11 percent of all babies born over the last year were exposed to illicit drugs during their mother's pregnancy. Drugs are in the schools, the home and in the workplace. Eight percent of last year's high school seniors said they had used cocaine over the previous year; 10 percent of college students said they did so. The drug council says 3 percent of workers between the ages of 20 and 40 are cocaine users. In a recent survey, the nation's employers said as many as one in five workers have alcohol or illegal drug problems. Drug-related absenteeism, medical expenses and lost productivity are costing employers an estimated 3 percent of their payroll _ half the typical company's payment for an employee's Social Security coverage. There are some encouraging signs. The national survey on drug abuse has found a recent decline in so-called `` casual'' drug abuse by young people. Two years ago, an estimated 17 percent of college students were occasional users, compared to 10 percent today. But the number of heavy abusers _ particularly involving cocaine _ has risen sharply. The percentage of weekly and daily cocaine users has doubled since 1986; the number of cocaine-induced deaths recorded by hospital emergency rooms totaled 1,696 last year, up from 604 in 1984. Overall, emergency rooms treated 46,020 cocaine patients last year, compared to 8,831 in 1984, an increase of 421 percent. Like the brass-hat body counters in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, prosecutors and police often trumpet their battlefield victories to the news media _ seizures of vast quantities of drugs worth fortunes on the street, massive arrests purporting to destroy this or that trafficking ring. Like <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s tunnel light, such announcements bear little semblance to the real course of the war. Fact is, illicit drugs, especially cocaine, are in more plentiful supply, at cheaper prices, in more potent form, than ever. The marijuana smoked today is as much as 10 times more powerful than the stuff used by the flower child of the 1960s. A <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> study shows the purty of cocaine sold on the streets increased from 29 percent to 73 percent in just the two years between 1982 and 1984, and has remained there. The price has dropped to under $ 100 per gram for the much purer, deadlier drug. Urban slums have long been the stomping grounds of drug dealers. But the arrival of crack, a potent and cheap derivative of cocaine, has done for those neighborhoods what gunpowder has done for <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. Cocaine was once considered the rich man's drug. With crack rocks selling for a mere $ 5, nearly anyone, children included, can find a way to obtain it. Pharmacologists say the drug itself chemically induces more paranoia and violence than most any other, though another drug of choice _ PCP or `` angel dust,'' can be as bad or worse. And desperation among users, prepared to rob and kill for the money to buy it, and competition among sellers, eager to establish trafficking monopolies, heighten the explosive mix. The firepower and disregard for innocent life exhibited by the gangs of young punks marketing crack, from Jamaicans in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to the `` Crips'' and `` Bloods'' in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, is astonishing. `` Drive-by'' killings, the spontaneous murder of someone because he is dressed, sometimes unwittingly, in the colors of a rival gang, have become commonplace. In <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, the cops who raided the arms cache of one drug gang found the usual assortment of machine guns and sawed-off shotguns along with, of all things, a cluster bomb. Cluster bombs, normally dropped from airplanes, are designed to kill anyone within a wide area.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> recently sent its drug reseachers into schools located in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s poorer neighborhoods, where they interviewed adolescent boys in the ninth and 10th grades. The information was later corroborated by criminal activity reports and school records. Eighty percent denied using or selling drugs. But 28 percent admitted carrying a concealed weapon; 17 percent had participated in a group attack; 13 percent admitted selling drugs, making an average $ 1,000 per week; 11 percent had assaulted an adult; and 5 percent had shot, stabbed or killed someone. And that, from kids only 14 and 15 years old. Last month, a <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> study in 14 major cities found that more than half the men arrested for any serious crime _ and who volunteered for drug testing _ were drug users. In <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, the figure was 82 percent. `` There should be no longer any question as to how much of a catalyst for crime the lust for illegal drugs has become in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> today,'' Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburg </PERSON> said. `` Drug users and traffickers will beat, rob and kill anyone for drugs and profits.'' The toll, of course, is not limited to physical violence. The House Select Committee on Narcotics Abuse and Control estimated in February that there are 6 million to 6.5 million Americans in need of drug-abuse treatment, including 1.3 million intravenous drug abusers. Currently, treatment programs are available for only 250,000 abusers, the committee said. Meanwhile, quite aside from the thousands of drug-stupified patients they treat, hospital emergency rooms are soaked with the blood of drug-related violence. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s homicide rate, 59.4 per 100,000 population, edged out <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>'s last year to make the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> the nation's murder capital. The majority of the killings were drug murders, and the rate is climbing again this year. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s police arrested 43,000 people last year. The vast majority were set free, mostly because the city had no place to imprison them. The same story applies in other cities. In <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, misdemeanor offenders are released on personal recognizance because there is no room in the <LOCATION> Cook </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> jail. Nationwide, fewer than one in six people arrested on drug-trafficking charges spend more than a year in jail. <LOCATION> Rural </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is hardly immune. In a survey of all 93 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorneys, the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> found cases involving major drug trafficking and related contract killings throughout the heartlands. `` We knew that the country was awash in narcotics and dangerous drugs, but we did not expect to find significant cocaine operations, for example, in <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, or heroin trafficking in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>. `` Crack,'' he added, `` is everywhere.'' But cocaine is just the salt in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s drug stew. <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s drug lords are not responsible for the 100,000 elementary school children who get drunk at least once a week on the beer and fruit-flavored wine coolers they see consumed by their parents and television heroes They are not responsible for the 48,000 youngsters who are killed or injured in automobile accidents caused by intoxicated drivers every year. They are not responsible for the five-fold increase in lung cancer since 1963 among women, who now smoke tobacco in nearly the same numbers as men. The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> says half a billion workdays are lost each year because of alcoholism alone. That's a 2 percent loss in the nation's productivity. The federal government estimates that alcohol and drug abuse costs the economy nearly $ 200 billion a year. Two-thirds of that is attributed to alcohol. There is no end to this war. Alcoholics Anonymous and Narcotics Anonymous, the two most successful, self-supporting treatment programs, know there is no such thing as a cured addict; only a recovering one. Their members go about it one day at a time. The government can do no better.

<HEAD>Global Warming: How Much? How Soon? Experts Disagree</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID FOSTER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SUNDANCE, Utah (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Should we all be checking out real estate in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, or are scientists who warn of catastrophic global warming just blowing hot air? Sometimes it's hard to tell, admits one of those scientists. At a recent conference here on global warming, climatologist <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON> displayed two <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> articles from last January. `` <LOCATION> US </LOCATION> Data Since 1895 Fail To Show Warming Trend,'' one headline proclaimed. `` Global Warmth In 88 Is Found To Set A Record,'' said the other. <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON> turned to his audience and asked, `` Anybody here confused?'' If so, they're not alone. Ever since the hot, dry summer of 1988, the news has been full of scientists grimly predicting droughts, floods and famine if we do n't act immediately to halt global warming. At the same time, others urge caution, saying it's foolish to solve a problem nobody has proved to exist. While most scientists concur on the basic mechanism behind global warming, there is less agreement over how much or how quickly the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> is heating up, and even less over what should be done about it. Now politicians and special interests have leaped into the fray, making it even harder for a concerned citizen to winnow science from speculation and reason from rhetoric. Here is a look at what scientists know _ and just as importantly, do n't know _ about global warming: The underlying principle is called the greenhouse effect, familiar to anyone who has left a car with the windows rolled up in a sunny parking lot. The short-wavelength sunlight passes through the windows and is absorbed by the seats, which give off long-wavelength heat radiation that's trapped by the glass. The `` windows'' in <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>'s atmosphere are gases such as carbon dioxide, methane and chlorofluorocarbons -LRB- chemicals used in refrigeration and aerosol products -RRB-. They let sunlight through but trap heat radiated from the ground, keeping it from escaping into space. `` If anyone is dubious that a greenhouse effect can be dangerous,'' says astronomer <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Sagan </PERSON>, `` just point them to our neighboring planets.'' A thin atmosphere keeps Mars in a deep-freeze, while an atmosphere rich in carbon dioxide keeps <PERSON> Venus </PERSON> roasting like an oven. Earth, meanwhile, with a moderate carbon dioxide concentration, has equable temperatures, liquid water and abundant life. But since 1850, <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>'s atmospheric carbon dioxide has increased 25 percent, mostly due to burning fossil fuels. During the same period, average global temperature, compiled from hundreds of monitoring stations, has increased about 1 degree Fahrenheit. Cause and effect? Common sense might suggest that rising levels of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases are responsible for global warming, and that is the basis of mathematical models being used to predict future warming. If nothing is done to reduce society's production of greenhouse gases, the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> faces the equivalent of a doubling of carbon dioxide by the middle of the next century. And that, the various models predict, could produce a global temperature rise of 2 to 10 degrees. The serious disagreement starts here. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Jastrow </PERSON>, former director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Goddard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION>, questions both the accuracy of those models and the assumption that increasing greenhouse gases have already caused warming. The past century's warming trend could be due to natural climate variations or changes in the sun's brightness, he says. And present climate models are so coarse that their treatment of how clouds affect warming varies by a factor of three; such a wide discrepancy casts doubt on all the models, he says. But <PERSON> Jastrow </PERSON>'s successor at the <ORGANIZATION> Goddard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON>, is a leading supporter of the climate models. Though uncertainties remain, he says, they are unlikely to change his basic conclusion, `` that a growing greenhouse effect will increase the frequency and severity of the extremes of the hydrologic cycle: droughts, on the one hand, and extreme wetness and storms on the other.'' While <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jastrow </PERSON> argue the big picture, little nuggets of information are offered up almost daily, providing fodder for each side of the global warming debate. Skeptics can use the first <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> story mentioned by <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON>. It noted that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> temperatures since 1895 do nothing to confirm global warming. But believers can point out that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> occupies just 2 percent of the globe. And they can cite the second Times story, which said that 1988 had the warmest average global temperature on record. Each finding may be accurate, as far as it goes. But how significant is it? A warm year, like 1988, may draw attention to global warming, but most scientists now say last year's <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> drought and heat were natural atmospheric fluctuations caused by cyclical swings in <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> water temperatures. Yet, the six warmest years on record all have been within this decade. In order, they are 1988, 1987, 1983, 1981, 1980 and 1986. To sort out nature's fickleness from longterm trends, climatologists continually plug new factors into mathematical models already so complex it takes days to run them through powerful computers. Verifying the major effects of greenhouse warming could take 10 to 20 years of observation, <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> says. By then, some scientists warn, it may be too lae to stop greenhouse warming already in the works. A temperature change in the lower range of predictions might not cause catastrophic damage. But a 10-degree rise could expand ocean water and melt enough polar ice to raise sea level nearly three feet, flooding coastal regions worldwide, some scientists say. Despite the uncertainties, many scientists _ and more recently, government policymakers _ have decided global warming is too much of a risk to ignore. In May, the White House softened its go-slow attitude to embrace the idea of a formal international treaty-negotiating process on global warming. Citing a `` growing consensus'' among scientists, the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> in March urged the reduction of carbon dioxide through energy conservation techniques such as development of fuel-efficient cars, energy-saving homes and solar technology. But such measures can cost big money, and maneuvering has already begun to protect special interests. Last month, the oil industry released a study that concluded natural gas heat might contribute more to the greenhouse effect than oil heat. The gas industry attacked the report as flawed and biased. Such spirited debate, while not always enlightening, at least keeps the issue of global warming alive. And that, <PERSON> Schneider </PERSON> said, is key. A crisis _ last summer's heat wave _ drew attention to global warming. But addressing the problem will take a long-term commitment to research and action, he said. `` I hope that a cold, wet winter or normal summer or two wo n't deter humanity'' from learning more about global warming, he said `` The bottom line is, we insult the environment at a faster rate than we understand the consequences.''

<HEAD>Testing Finds Mercury Contamination Around State</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD COLE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>THE EVERGLADES, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The catch from some of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s most popular fishing spots is unhealthy and even fish and alligator meat from the protected <LOCATION> Everglades </LOCATION> is off limits as test after test shows alarming levels of mercury. `` If it's so bad here in the <LOCATION> Everglades </LOCATION>, which is supposed to be so pristine and so pure, then what's it like outside the park?'' said <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Tolle </PERSON>, spokeswoman for <LOCATION> Everglades </LOCATION> <LOCATION> National </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, where 10 times the federally set safe level of poisonous metal was found in fish and alligators. Health officials have warned against eating large amounts of fish from <LOCATION> Deer </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and fishing spots down to the <ORGANIZATION> Loxahatchee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Refuge </ORGANIZATION> south of <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Okeechobee </LOCATION>. The second annual alligator hunt was canceled in much of southern <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> because the meat was tainted, and high levels of mercury turned up in the <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> area and the <LOCATION> Suwannee </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. The levels of mercury, usually associated with factories and processing plants, shocked state experts when testing began last year. `` An hour before we got the first results, I would have been willing to say to someone, ` Not in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, because we do n't have that type of industry,''' said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Savage </PERSON>, a Department of Environmental Regulation biologist. `` But what we're finding is that there is a chronic low level of mercury in fish statewide, and then there are hot spots like the <LOCATION> Everglades </LOCATION>.'' Wildlife officers are testing the rare <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> panther and plan to do the same with wading birds. They hope those animals, unlike bass and alligators, do not eat enough fish to ingest dangerous amounts of mercury _ but they say no one expected to find mercury in the first place. `` Birds and mammals need to be looked at,'' said <PERSON> Burkett </PERSON> <PERSON> Neely </PERSON>, manager at <LOCATION> Loxahatchee </LOCATION>. `` We're doing testing into the estuary and out into <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> _ and there, you're getting into a commercial fishing zone.'' If mercury is found in higher animals, Ms. <PERSON> Tolle </PERSON> said it might help explain one of the park's mysteries, a drop in wading birds since 1900. `` The numbers now are 90 percent less that at the turn of the century.'' Mercury's effects on people _ damage to the nervous system that can cause deafness, numbness, reduced vision and coordination _ are well documented, but little is known about what it can do to the complex ecology, she said. Most people seem to be heeding the health advisories. Before the first warnings, the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> Game and <ORGANIZATION> Fresh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Water </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> found that fishermen relased 56 percent of the largemouth bass caught around <LOCATION> Loxahatchee </LOCATION>. After the warnings, that climbed to 81 percent, said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Morello </PERSON>, an agency biologist. Harder to convince are low-income residents around the parks who supplement their diets by fishing and are suspicious or ignorant of the advisories. But so far, there's no evidence of anyone affected by mercury poisoning, <PERSON> Savage </PERSON> said. Of most concern is determining the origin of the contamination. A prime suspect for the mercury present in lower levels around <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> is airborne pollution, <PERSON> Savage </PERSON> said. `` Just like <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> have an acid rain problem, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> may have a problem with mercury.'' That would explain why mercury is widespread, but <PERSON> Savage </PERSON> said some areas have virtually no mercury in fish, undermining the theory. When the initial findings were confined to <LOCATION> Loxahatchee </LOCATION>, prime suspects were farms south of <LOCATION> Okeechobee </LOCATION>, who once used now-banned, mercury-based fungicides. But it became clear that agriculture alone was n't enough of an explanation. Savage and others are looking at a theory that mercury, which occurs in small amounts naturally, may concentrate in certain plants, which in turn die and are compressed into peat at the bottom of the <LOCATION> Everglades </LOCATION>. `` The peat down there, that very rich <LOCATION> Everglades </LOCATION> muck, has naturally a very high level of mercury,'' <PERSON> Savage </PERSON> said. `` It's possible man has disrupted the peat with drainage and water movement, mobilizing the mercury. Drainage canals and water movement could help explain why some of the highest concentrations are in areas of the <LOCATION> Everglades </LOCATION> never exploited directly by man. `` You have to look what's upstream,'' <PERSON> Neely </PERSON> said. Water in southern <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> flows from the agricultural areas along <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Okeechobee </LOCATION> generally southward into the <LOCATION> Everglades </LOCATION>, he said. `` It's possible the mercury is being released naturally from the peat and is being moved up and down by farming practices.'' Whatever the cause, the discovery has changed for the worse the way people look at their natural surroundings. `` My worst fear is, what else do n't I know?'' <PERSON> Neely </PERSON> said. `` What is this going to do to the wildlife? What are the long term effects? And what other bear traps are we going to step in out there?''

<HEAD>Birds of Prey Research Leads To Forest Preservation Work</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 From the Great Seal of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to the folklore of Native Americans, birds of prey have been powerful symbols of freedom, dignity and strength. But eagles, hawks and other raptors also send another message. Because of their position near the top of the food chain, they serve as environmental monitors, warning of impending danger like canaries in a coal mine. `` If we see things happening to these birds ... that signals us that there are more severe problems lower down in the food chain,'' said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Cade </PERSON>, who founded the <ORGANIZATION> Peregrine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> in 1970 while a professor at <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. Peregrine Fund researchers and volunteers, who helped bring the species back from near extinction, now are applying what they learned to the study and preservation of raptors _ predatory birds distinguished by talons, hooked beaks and keen eyesight _ from the jungles of <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> to the plains of <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. At the World Center for Birds of Prey in the southwestern <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> desert, researchers breed tropical raptors in captivity for release in the wild. Others are in the field, collecting data on the birds in their native habitat. Their work has led them into the battle to preserve tropical rain forests that are home to half the world's plant and animal species and are disappearing at the rate of 50 acres a minutes, said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Burnham </PERSON>, the center's director. `` Many of the nations are beginning to see their environments as their futures,'' <PERSON> Burnham </PERSON> said. `` If you eliminate your natural resources, if you cut down all your forests, your children and your grandchildren wo n't have much to look forward to.'' The impact of the rain forests reaches far beyond the boundaries of the nations they cover; many songbirds, waterfowl and raptors considered indigenous to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> actually spend much of their time in the tropics. `` Wildlife do not recognize political boundaries,'' <PERSON> Burnham </PERSON> said. `` You ca n't be provincial and manage a highly migratory species.'' Little is known about many of the tropical raptors, and `` there is no way to know how to preserve them if you know nothing about them,'' he said. In its `` Maya Project'' in <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Belize </LOCATION>, the Peregrine Fund is studying raptors in both pristine and altered forests to see how the birds adapt to changes in their environment. It also is trying to determine where the birds live in the forests and how much territory they need to survive and breed _ information that later can be used in establishing wildlife preserves. For example, the harpy eagle, thought to be the most powerful eagle in the world, may require 5,000 acres or more for each pair, <PERSON> Cade </PERSON> said. Studying the birds first required finding them in the dense, mosquito-infested jungles. From perches atop trees and ancient Mayan temples, researchers were able to observe some birds flying above the forest canopy. Other species were lured with taped calls. The team has detected 26 raptor species in the two Central American nations. Working with peregrines not only gave the group a scientific background that can be applied to other raptors, but it also helped them develop skills needed to work with other people, <PERSON> Burnham </PERSON> said. `` Cooperation is the key word. We are not a confrontational organization. We are a conservation organization that works together with other groups.'' Among those cooperating on the Maya Project are <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Anthropology </ORGANIZATION> and History and the <ORGANIZATION> Belize </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> Though prospects of saving tropical raptors seem daunting, the Peregrine Fund can take heart from past success when the odds were against them. Because of the effects of the pesticide DDT, peregrine falcons, once common in much of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, had been had reduced to 35 pairs by 1975, and none remained east of the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>. Largely through the efforts of the fund, there now are more than 600 falcons in 25 states. The group's goal is to have the birds removed from the endangered species list by the turn of the century. `` It's gone a long way further than I ever envisioned it back when we started,'' <PERSON> Cade </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Chicago Struggles to Cope With Measles Outbreak</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 More than 1,100 measles cases have been reported in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> as it copes with the worst outbreak in the resurgence of the disease this year. The national <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> said 1,123 measles cases were reported to <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> health officials through Aug. 23, and that 78 percent have occurred in preschool children. In the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, 9,650 measles cases have been reported in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, compared with 2,151 in the 1988 period. The <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> outbreak `` is similar to others among inner-city populations in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in that it involves primarily unvaccinated black and Hispanic preschool-aged children,'' the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said. Blacks and Hispanics account for 94 percent of the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> cases. <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> authorities have set up at least seven new vaccination clinics, which have administered at least 21,000 doses of measles vaccine. Door-to-door teams have given at least 2,000 more doses, and the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said vaccination clinics have also been set up in four hospital emergency departments. Measles, a once-common childhood disease, was believed on the verge of eradication in this country in the early'80s _ just 1,497 cases were reported in 1983 _ but case counts have increased since.

<HEAD>Federal Wildlife Officials to Split Whooping Crane Colony</HEAD>

 Federal wildlife officials plan to split the world's only captive colony of whooping cranes this November to reduce the chance the flock could be wiped out by disease or natural disaster. The <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said 22 of the 54 endangered birds at the <ORGANIZATION> Patuxent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> would be shipped to the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Baraboo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION> `` The service has been concerned about having all of their eggs in one basket, literally,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Trauger </PERSON>, the center's deputy director. `` The service felt it was the prudent thing to do, to separate the breeding flocks, and there's enough breeders now to do that.'' The center started in 1987 to breed the rare birds under a joint program with Canadian wildlife officials. The <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> foundation was selected as the home of the new flock after considering several groups across the nation. Although the foundation has not bred whooping cranes, it has successfully bred 13 of the 14 other existing species of cranes in the world.

<HEAD>Apache Reservation Car Death Rate Seven Times Nation's</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Indian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> has determined that the 2,600-square-mile White Mountain Apache Reservation in eastern <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> has a car-crash death rate seven times that of the nation as a whole.

<TEXT>
 A computer chip covered with a sensitive membrane can indicate when nuclear detonators need replacement and could lead to wristwatch-sized detectors for hazardous chemicals, bombs and illicit drugs. The chip, no larger than a fingernail, was developed by <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> researchers. Air Force and <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> researchers will concentrate on joint study to develop chips to detect poison gases and degrading detonators. `` I think what we've developed is a very sound scientific technique that can be used for detecting very small concentrations of gas,'' said <PERSON> Kolesar </PERSON>. The chemical-sensitive membrane lets gas through to trigger an electronic signal. Such chips could be installed in nuclear warheads to detect the chemicals given off by the degradation of chemicals in the warheads, he said. `` What we really see though is that because the technology is generic, by putting down different membranes ... it's essentially limitless.'' For example, the devices could be used by workers to signal unacceptable levels of hazardous materials, <PERSON> Kolesar </PERSON> said. Dosimeters, which are used in many cases to detect toxic materials, only reveal exposure after the fact. Another possible application is in developing lighter and stronger metals by combining existing metals, he said. `` There is an optimum cure temperature and cure length cycle,'' which the chip could be used to pinpoint. It also could be used to ferret out bombs by the chemicals they emit. Current detectors for measuring contaminants are mostly bulky and vulnerable to being confused by the presence of more than one chemical, he said. The microchips so far have been developed to detect only organic phosphate and nitrogen dioxide, said <PERSON> Kolesar </PERSON>, who has been working on the process for 12 years. It will take another three to five years for commercial development. `` It's very rewarding to change something quite dramatically,'' he said. `` You probably get only one of those opportunities in life.''

<HEAD>Report: Value-Added Tax Has Drawbacks</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 More than 40 percent of chief executives surveyed nationwide favor introduction of a value-added tax to help reduce the federal deficit, according to a report. But the report released Wednesday by the <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> offered mixed conclusions on whether the enormous revenue potential of a value-added tax, or VAT, outweighs its drawbacks. A value-added tax is passed along during the stages of production, from raw materials suppliers to manufacturers to wholesalers to retailers to consumers, who bear the final burden of the tax. At each stage, buyers pay a progressively higher tax to sellers, who recover a portion of the VAT paid during earlier purchases. The <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> report estimated that VAT could raise between $ 13 billion and $ 22 billion annually in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for each percentage point of tax levied. But it said a VAT would not be cost efficient at below 10 percent and that countries employing the tax have rates between 15 percent and 25 percent. In a survey of 400 chief executive officers asked recently to evaluate new revenue sources to reduce the deficit, 42 percent favored a VAT, 35 percent were opposed and 33 percent were neutral. `` Many like VAT because it has demonstrated its feasibility through a history of good compliance, reasonable administrative costs and public preference,'' <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> research associate <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON> <PERSON> Skelly </PERSON> said. Among concerns cited in the report, though, were the cost and number of employees that would be needed to implement and operate the tax. The <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> estimated that in 1988 the tax would have cost the government $ 700 million and required 20,000 new employees. Other estimates have been higher, the report said. Also, opponents argue that VAT would only allow the government to spend more money while not necessarily reducing the deficit and would place a greater burden on poor families who spend more on goods and services, the report said. The report also said that no way of coordinating the federal value-added tax with state and local taxes such as sales taxes has been determined. The <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> is a nonprofit research organization supported by companies, trade and professional groups, government agencies, labor unions, schools, libraries and individuals.

<HEAD>British Takeover Panel To Decide On Extension of Hoylake Bid</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s Panel on Takeovers and Mergers says it will hold a hearing next week to decide whether <ORGANIZATION> Hoylake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investments </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> could extend its $ 21.4 billion hostile bid for <ORGANIZATION> BAT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> beyond the normal 60-day deadline. A ruling on an extension would be pivotal to the outcome of the 13.4 billion-pound hostile offer for the British conglomerate, analysts said. Last week, Sir <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldsmith </PERSON>, who leads <LOCATION> Hoylake </LOCATION>, said it would be difficult for the offer to succeed without an extension from the panel, an independent body which under British law monitors takeover developments. The panel said Wednesday that <PERSON> Holylake </PERSON>'s request would be considered at a hearing on Wednesday. <PERSON> Hoylake </PERSON> made the request for an extension because it is seeking the required approval from insurance regulators in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for the acquisition of <ORGANIZATION> Farmers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> BAT </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> insurance unit. Under the laws of the nine states where Farmers operates, officials must approve any change in control of insurance concerns. <LOCATION> Hoylake </LOCATION> launched its bid for BAT on Aug. 8. Under British law the first closing date for the offer is Oct. 7. Additional delays in gaining approval from insurance regulators could put <ORGANIZATION> Hoylake </ORGANIZATION>'s ability to meet that deadline into question. BAT has argued that the timetable is an integral part of takeover rules and should not be altered, especially when delays in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> could have been anticipated. Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION> Axa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Midi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assurances </ORGANIZATION>, the French company that would acquire Farmers if <LOCATION> Hoylake </LOCATION> is successful in its bid, said it had begun seeking regulatory approval to buy the insurance company in the states where Farmers operates. Farmers does business in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Hoylake </LOCATION> has filed suit in those states, claiming its purchase of BAT would not constitute a change in control of Farmers, and that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> regulators have no right to hold up a deal between two foreign companies. <ORGANIZATION> Axa </ORGANIZATION> has a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> subsidiary, <ORGANIZATION> Gamma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Re </ORGANIZATION>, a reinsurer which operates in 37 states. BAT's other businesses include retailing, tobacco and paper products. It owns <ORGANIZATION> Saks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fifth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Avenue </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Marshall </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Field </LOCATION>'s stores, <ORGANIZATION> Brown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Williamson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Appleton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Papers </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Goldsmith </PERSON> announced last month he would sell Farmers to <PERSON> Axa </PERSON> <PERSON> Midi </PERSON> if his bid succeeded.

<HEAD>Record Fed Intervention to Halt Dollar's Rise in May-July Period</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VIVIAN MARINO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> intervened in record amounts from late spring to mid summer to halt the dollar's sharp ascent in foreign exchange, which resulted from higher interest rates and political turmoil in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. A quarterly foreign-exchange report issued Wednesday by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> showed the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> sold $ 11.92 billion in exchange for West German marks and Japanese yen during the three months ended July 31. It was the largest intervention since the winter of 1978-79, when the government leaned the opposite way, buying $ 6.9 billion with marks and yen to support a dollar that was being eroded by high inflation. The previous largest sale of dollars occurred when the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> dumped $ 3.2 billion from August to October of 1985. That sale reflected an agreement among the big industrialized nations, known as the Group of Seven, to lower the dollar's value to shrink the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit. The latest quarterly <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> report showed the government bought $ 7.24 billion worth of yen and $ 4.68 billion worth of marks. Overseas central banks also sold dollars, according to the report. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> sold $ 6.74 billion in May, $ 4.95 billion in June and $ 230 million in July. The dollar reached its peak of the year in early June, when it traded at two-year highs of 2.047 marks and 151.90 yen, up roughly 9 percent and 14 percent respectively from the end of April. However, by the end of July it was up just 3 percent against the yen and less than 1 percent vs. the mark. <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Y </PERSON>. Cross, an executive vice president for the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>, attributed the retreat from the peak to the central bank dollar sales and changing perceptions about the economy. Lately the dollar has been trading around 1.97 marks and 146 yen, its highest levels since the May-July period, due to signs of renewed strength in the economy. Currency traders already suspected that the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> had intervened heavily during the period, but the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s policy is to comment only well after the fact. In early 1987 the <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seven </ORGANIZATION> nations _ <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> _ agreed to work together to stabilize the currency markets following a sharp decline in the dollar. The group also secretly set target zones for exchange rates, although it has never confirmed that the zones exist or what they are. `` All the intervention we did could be taken as an indication we wanted to ... bring about greater stability in the exchange rates,'' said Cross. `` We're not driving it down as much as keeping it from rising.'' <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> intervention was the strongest in late May, when the dollar first pierced the psychologically important 2-mark and 142-yen levels. At that time, investment demand was strong because <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interest rates remained high in comparison to rates abroad. During the dollar's surge, the economy appeared strong and the trade deficit seemed to be shrinking. Traders decided to test the central bank's firmness in holding down the dollar. Also adding support to the dollar was political turmoil abroad, including the bloody crackdown against student protesters in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and government scandals in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. By late June the dollar had softened as interest rates began to drop and signs of slower economic growth began to emerge.

 The biggest employee-owned company in the nation would be created if <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s pilots and management succeed with their $ 6.75 billion bid for the parent of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> would lead a fast-growing group. In the past two years, more than 300 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies have been acquired by their employees, according to <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Blasi </PERSON>, a business professor and expert on employee ownership. Federal tax benefits and the wave of hostile buyouts have spurred employees to take over their companies completely or acquire big equity stakes. The latter category includes big corporations such as <ORGANIZATION> J.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Penney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Procter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gamble </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Polaroid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> PPG </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. Chicago-based <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> would enjoy marked advantages over other employee-owned enterprises, some experts The company is widely recognized as one of the strongest and most profitable in the airline industry, giving it a head start under the new regime of employee owners. <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON>, who is part of the takeover team, has said that under the proposal, the employees do not contemplate selling any essential assets or revising plans for expanding the airline fleet and routes. `` The fact that <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> is in good shape certainly does give -LRB- employee ownership -RRB- a better start,'' <PERSON> Corey </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosen </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ownership </ORGANIZATION>, said Wednesday. `` It's the first time it's been tried on this scale. If it succeeds, it would put in a whole new array of weapons for unions to use.'' That's a fairly big `` if.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union at <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>, whose cooperation is considered critical, has expressed doubt that the takeover attempt could succeed because it would require enormous new debt. `` I look at it sort of pessimistically now, because we've done an analysis on <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> ... I think they've put a price on it that's too overpriced,'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Peterpaul </PERSON>, general vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION>, said Wednesday. `` We do n't see the future as rosy as a lot of people see it.'' That stance appeared to strengthen the chances that billionaire investor <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> could succeed in his rival bid for <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION>. If the pilot-management attempt does prevail, <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> would displace car rental giant <ORGANIZATION> Avis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> as the nation's largest company owned by its employees. An employee stock ownership plan, or <ORGANIZATION> ESOP </ORGANIZATION>, representing 11,000 <ORGANIZATION> Avis </ORGANIZATION> workers in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> took the company private in a $ 1.75 billion buyout in September 1987. <ORGANIZATION> Avis </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Vittoria </PERSON> says he received a letter over a year ago from the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> pilots seeking his advice on ESOPs. `` I do n't think <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION>'s size is a hindrance to an <ORGANIZATION> ESOP </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Vittoria </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. Asked whether its size could actually be an advantage for employee ownership, he replied, `` It could be, but it depends on management getting employees involved.'' <ORGANIZATION> Avis </ORGANIZATION> has a multi-tiered employee participation program that is considered a model by some experts. Worker representatives are elected by their co-workers and participate in monthly district-level meetings with managers to review operations and make suggestions. The local groups also elect representatives to attend quarterly zone meetings, semi-annual regional meetings and an annual company-wide meeting. Under the <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> pilot-management proposal, <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> would own 15 percent of <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION>'s stock for an investment of $ 750 million. The employees would agree to unspecified wage concessions in exchange for participation in an <ORGANIZATION> ESOP </ORGANIZATION> that would give them 75 percent of the company. News reports have indicated that the pilots union might invest as much as $ 1 billion. The rest of the buyout funding apparently would be borrowed. Only a small proportion, about 15 percent, of the employees participating in ESOPs are unionized. But the pilots, Machinists and flight attendants at <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's second-largest airline, are strong unionists. <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> under employee ownership `` would have to be run as a partnership, not as a feudal barony,'' said <PERSON> Blasi </PERSON>, a professor at <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Polytechnic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Luis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Obispo </LOCATION>, whose book, `` Employee Ownership: Revolution or Ripoff?'' is critical of some ESOPs. `` In the airline industry, most ESOPs have not been combined with a strong employee involvement program. Board seats are not enough,'' he said. <PERSON> Blasi </PERSON> said he is waiting to see specific details from <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> and the pilots on how labor-management committees would be set up to address problems and make decisions. He cited a 1983-84 experiment with partial employee ownership at <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, under former chairman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Borman </PERSON>, which he called `` a great success.'' Under the program, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> employees generated ideas to improve productivity. An <ORGANIZATION> ESOP </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, before it was merged into <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION>, also was a good example of labor-management cooperation, <PERSON> Blasi </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, an aggressive regional carrier based in <LOCATION> Tempe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, is about 20 percent owned by its employees. And <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> established an <ORGANIZATION> ESOP </ORGANIZATION> in July, in a moved widely viewed as a deterrent to unwanted suitors as takeover speculation swept through the airline industry.

<HEAD>Report Says Government Failing to Track Economy</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The White House budget office has been blamed for the inability of government statisticians to track significant changes in the economy and their effect on people and businesses, even while spending some $ 2 billion this year trying. While the skills of workers are increasingly recognized as key to economic growth and improving the nation's competitiveness, the government spends nearly seven times more collecting data on agriculture than education, said the congressional Office of Technology Assessment. `` It seems unlikely that this is the right ratio, given the transformation under way in the economy,'' the agency said Wednesday in a 40-page report. `` Even worse, no organization in either the executive branch or the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has assumed responsibility for asking whether it's the right ratio.'' The report, `` Statistical Needs for a Changing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Economy,'' said the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> was told in 1980 to set priorities and coordinate the government's statistics-collecting efforts `` While it has a mandate to perform this task,'' the technology experts said, `` <ORGANIZATION> OMB </ORGANIZATION> has not given it much priority and has dedicated few resources to the effort.'' Efforts by agencies in the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> and other departments to correct shortcomings have been hampered by White House budget officials, said the report, which was requested by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. As an example, it cited cuts in the budgets of most agencies for collecting and analyzing data during the past eight years and a resistance by <ORGANIZATION> OMB </ORGANIZATION> officials to allow new surveys sought by statisticians. `` These organizations are painfully aware of the problems,'' the researchers said. `` The greatest problem appears to be the absence of any central place in government where basic questions about priorities in statistics are being asked.'' Sen. <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Bingaman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.M. </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> panel's subcommittee on government information and regulation, said <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will likely have to force the issue when the 1980 Paperwork Reduction Act comes up for reauthorization next year <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Clay </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the White House budget office, said its officials had not seen the report and so could not comment on it immediately. The congressional researchers acknowledged it has become much more difficult to develop meaningful statistics on economic growth and productivity with the emergence of an international market and a service-based <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy. `` The most important inputs purchased by a business may be research and engineering information and the skills and education of its employees,'' it said. `` The existing statistical system makes it extremely difficult to anticipate the potential impact of emerging technologies.'' It cited computers and how changes in their capabilities and prices are reflected in the nation's economic growth, inflation and productivity figures. For example, it said, the price of one megabyte of computer memory capacity fell by 95 percent between 1972 and 1987. `` Measuring changes in the quality of computers, however, can seem easy in comparison with the challenge of measuring changes in the quality of services,'' the report said. `` How do you measure quality changes in legal services?'' Changes in the quality of health care and education, which together account for more than one-sixth of the nation's gross national product, are not measured at all, the report said.

<HEAD>Government To Allow Drexel To Pay Milkens; Firm To Enter Plea</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 After months of challenges and delays, <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> is scheduled to plead guilty to securities crimes Monday and formally settle the highly publicized Wall Street corruption case. The court date was set after prosecutors switched course and allowed the investment firm to pay its former junk-bond chief, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>, his 1988 compensation of more than $ 100 million, removing the last roadblock to the plea bargain. `` We are pleased that the government has reversed its position and dropped the unconstitutional provisions of its settlement with <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Liman </PERSON>, a lawyer for <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>, said in a statement released Wednesday by a <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> spokesman. `` These unconstitutional provisions were a gross abuse of prosecutorial power,'' the statement said. `` Perhaps now the government will also reconsider its use and abuse in this case of the Draconian RICO statute.'' A 98-count indictment in March charged <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> and his brother <PERSON> Lowell </PERSON> with wide-ranging securities law and Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organization Act violations. A broader indictment is expected next month. The hearing Monday before <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Kimba </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> should end months of negotiations and challenges over an agreement announced in January in the government's insider trading probe. The government's reversal to allow <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> to pay its indicted former bond financier was made in court papers filed late last week. The move was first reported to be under consideration last month. Under the plea agreement, <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> will enter guilty pleas to six securities and mail fraud felonies. The firm also has agreed to pay $ 650 million in fines and restitution. The pact had required <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> to fire <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> and withhold his compensation for last year, estimated in court papers at more than $ 100 million. The agreement also had barred <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> from giving <PERSON> Lowell </PERSON> <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> more than half his 1988 pay. Both <ORGANIZATION> Milkens </ORGANIZATION> have since resigned from <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>. In a letter to <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> filed in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> late Friday, Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> said prosecutors dropped the pay provisions because of a bail agreement in which the government will monitor hundreds of millions of dollars of the <ORGANIZATION> Milkens </ORGANIZATION>' assets. `` In light of this security, the matter of any payment to be made by <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> to the <ORGANIZATION> Milkens </ORGANIZATION> can be resolved adequately between <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Milkens </ORGANIZATION>,'' the letter said. Lawyers for the <ORGANIZATION> Milkens </ORGANIZATION> immediately dropped a motion filed in January challenging the plea agreement on the grounds that it unfairly denied the brothers their 1988 pay. Defense lawyers and other experts following the case have said they surmised the government dropped the provision withholding pay because of a belief it would be rejected in court as unconstitutional. Sources familiar with the case said the government acted independently. `` It was the government deciding on its own, 100 percent, that they wanted to drop it,'' said one source who asked not to be named. A separate settlement with <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> of fraud and insider trading charges by the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> is to take effect once <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> enters its plea. Under that deal, <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> has agreed to broad structural changes and federal supervision for three years.

<HEAD>Settlements Approved in WPPSS Bondholder Suit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District judge says that plaintiffs in the nation's largest municipal-bond default might have gotten significantly smaller awards had they won their case at trial instead of settling. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Browning </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, on Tuesday approved settlements to allow $ 750 million to be distributed to holders of <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supply </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION> bonds in what he called `` one of the most complex lawsuits in the history of securities litigation.''. `` There is more than adequate reason to conclude that the aggregate amount of these settlements ... is fully satisfactory, given the risks associated with a full trial of the issues,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION>, trustee for the bondholders, in a statement quoting the judge's 106-page opinion, which was not immediately available. It was <PERSON> Browning </PERSON> who presided over the enormously complicated <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION> litigation that in the last year resulted in settlements between <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and defendants in the case. The trial began a year ago in <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION> but defendants reached settlements by January. In April, <PERSON> Browning </PERSON> held a fairness hearing on the settlement in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Berls </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> vice president who has handled <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION> matters, on Wednesday called <PERSON> Browning </PERSON>'s ruling a `` carte blanche'' approval of the negotiated settlements. `` This is a major milestone in the WPPSS litigation,'' he said. `` The bondholders are just one step away from distribution'' of the settlement money. The final step is for <PERSON> Browning </PERSON> to schedule a distribution hearing, at which attorneys will argue precisely how the funds should be distributed, <PERSON> Berls </PERSON> said. No such hearing has been scheduled, he said. In determining the distribution, the judge will emphasize when each bondholder purchased the bonds, <PERSON> Berls </PERSON> said. The plaintiffs in the case essentially broke down into two types of bondholders: those who purchased their bonds before the default on June 15, 1983, and those who bought bonds afterward. In 1983, <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION> defaulted on $ 2.25 billion in bonds it had sold to finance construction of a nuclear power plant at the <LOCATION> Hanford </LOCATION> nuclear reservation in Eastern <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and another at <LOCATION> Satsop </LOCATION>, west of <LOCATION> Olympia </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION> had abandoned construction of those two plants in 1982 because of rising construction costs and doubts about the need for the plants' power. The default was triggered by a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling that the participating utilities lacked the legal power to sign contracts with <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION> guaranteeing payment even if no electricity was generated. Dozens of lawsuits were combined into one action against <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION>, all 88 utilities that contracted with the consortium to build the two reactors, engineering firms, Wall Street bond underwriters, utility and <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION> directors and a consulting firm. The settlements approved require the defendants to pay $ 580 million into the Chemical Bank-administered settlement fund. Together with $ 107 million in settlements approved earlier, plus interest, the amount available for distribution in December would be $ 750 million, <PERSON> Berls </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Berls </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> was not worried that <PERSON> Browning </PERSON> would have exercised his other option, that of rejecting the settlements. <PERSON> Browning </PERSON>'s ruling `` validated all the actions we've taken,'' <PERSON> Berls </PERSON> said. `` I think the court by taking the action it did endorsed the end we were all trying to reach, which was peace,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION> paid no money in the settlement in exchange for cooperation from its employees at the trial. Plaintiff's attorneys said there was n't enough money left in <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION> to pursue. <ORGANIZATION> WPPSS </ORGANIZATION> was building five nuclear reactors to generate electricity in the late 1970s, but only one was completed. Two remain `` mothballed'' for construction to resume if enough demand materializes for the electricity they would produce.

 A 21.4 percent rise in late-August car and light truck sales may be a sign that sales will drop dramatically as the calendar year draws to a close, analysts say. The eight major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> based automakers reported Wednesday that their vehicles sold at an average daily rate of 49,276 during the Aug. 21-31 period this year, compared with a rate of 40,578 during the same time last year. `` We think a lot of the volume that we're seeing here is really coming out of the fourth quarter of this year or the first quarter of next year,'' said analyst <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirnan </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Kidder </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peabody </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. `` The $ 64,000 question is really how bad is volume going to be in the fourth quarter,'' he said. With overseas makers' results added in, car and truck sales were up 8.4 percent in August over the same month last year. Car sales rose 11.2 percent and truck sales were 2.2 percent higher for the month. Typically, dealers offer closeout deals as the model year draws to a close, traditionally on Sept. 30. On top of that, manufacturers have been offering customers and dealers incentives that lower the prices of 1989 cars. Consumers also have been learning that prices for 1990 cars will rise, prompting some to buy now rather than later. `` Consumers have been bombarded by these price hikes on the 1990 models going up anywhere from 2 -LRB- percent -RRB- to 9 percent,'' said analyst <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Heaney </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Nikko </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> `` Domestic automakers have n't done that in a long time. `` It's people out there thinking ` I've got to buy a car by the end of the year.''' <PERSON> Herb </PERSON> <PERSON> Adcox </PERSON>, owner of <ORGANIZATION> Adcox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chevrolet </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chattanooga </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, said he has seen some increased traffic through his showroom recently, and incentives are the reason. `` With this factory incentive that they have given the dealers, it's going to lower the price of the car,'' he said. `` I just hope that it works. `` If it does n't you've got a lot of dealers who are not going to order'90 models. They ca n't have inventory on top of inventory.'' For the first eight months of this year, domestic and imported car and truck sales were running 3.7 percent behind the pace of last year, the second-best year in history. Car sales were down 4.1 percent and truck sales were off 2.7 percent. Domestic automakers held 77.3 percent of the car and truck market at the end of August, up from 76 percent at the same time last year.

<HEAD>McDonald's Testing Fried Chicken in Houston, Dallas Markets</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The American consumer's continuing taste for chicken has prompted <ORGANIZATION> McDonald </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> to begin eyeing the fried-chicken market. McDonald's has begun a new test at six restaurants in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> and six in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, selling combination packets of two, three and nine pieces of deep-fried chicken. `` Americans are going toward lighter eating and we're following the tastes of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Horler </PERSON>, regional marketing manager for the <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> region. The company already serves chicken in sandwiches, salads and in bite-size boneless bits. `` The testing is in the embryonic stage,'' said <PERSON> Horler </PERSON>. `` The question is, can we deliver a good quality, value-priced product in the quick environment we have?'' To find this out, the company is looking at how its equipment is handling the new product and what customers think about it. Sometimes, as with the company's experimental pizza, the product goes back to the kitchen for a recipe makeover after the operational testing and before it goes out for a full market test. McDonald's salads were in the testing phase for 10 years before being made generally available, <PERSON> Horler </PERSON> said. The fried chicken is being sold after 4 p.m., aimed at the family dinner business. There are three combinations: two pieces, a breast and leg, selling for $ 1.99; three pieces, breast, leg and thigh, for $ 2.89; and nine pieces, three breasts, three legs and three thighs for $ 7.89. Dinner rolls are included. The chicken is kept frozen and then fried for customers. No decision has been made on whether to expand the fried chicken experiment, <PERSON> Horler </PERSON> said.

 H.J. <ORGANIZATION> Heinz </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Chairman <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> J.F </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Reilly </PERSON> says his company and animal rights activists stand in agreement _ the slaughter of dolphins caught with yellowfin tuna must end. Aside from humanitarian reasons, <PERSON> O'Reilly </PERSON> said, <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON> has a commercial interest in saving the dolphins because dolphins swim with tuna in the eastern <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION>, leading fishing boats to their catch. `` We have more interest in the porpoise than they have ... if you see them as the sheepdog of the sea,'' <PERSON> O'Reilly </PERSON> said. `` The simple truth is that releasing dolphins represent a more successful fishing technique than ignoring their safety.'' <PERSON> O'Reilly </PERSON> reacted after about 50 protesters, led by the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco-based </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Earth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Island </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, picketed <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON>'s annual shareholders meeting at a downtown hotel Wednesday, carrying anti-Heinz signs and chanting, `` <PERSON> Boycott </PERSON> tuna. <PERSON> Boycott </PERSON> <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON>.'' Two protesters _ <PERSON> Todd </PERSON> <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON>, 23, of <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Heitchue </PERSON>, 24, of <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruz </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION> _ lowered themselves from a nearby eight-story building and unfurled a banner reading, `` Heinz Stop Killing Dolphins,'' before police arrested them on disorderly conduct, criminal trespass and criminal mischief charges. Another protest organizer, <PERSON> Candace </PERSON> <PERSON> Batycki </PERSON> of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, briefly disrupted the shareholders' meeting by screaming, `` You're slaughtering dolphins What kind of world do you want to live in?'' Protesters and company officials agreed thousands of dolphins are being killed with yellowfin tuna in large, encircling nets set mostly by foreign fishermen. Ms. <PERSON> Batycki </PERSON> estimated at least 150,000 dolphins die in the catch annually. `` It's not necessary to fish on dolphins, just easier,'' she said. `` They -LRB- <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON> -RRB- have a lot of power in their hands. They have the power to end this.'' Protesters claimed a boycott of tuna products has hurt <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> StarKist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seafood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary and other producers <PERSON> O'Reilly </PERSON> estimated <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> yellowfin tuna represents 20 percent of StarKist's catch But <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON>, in its first-quarter earnings report issued Tuesday, said StarKist's tuna contributed to a 15 percent increase in earnings. `` Our sales of tuna are at an all-time high,'' <PERSON> O'Reilly </PERSON> said. But he told shareholders the killing of dolphins was `` a legitimate concern.'' `` We're doing everything we can to save the porpoise,'' <PERSON> O'Reilly </PERSON> said. A new $ 100,000 research program, announced by StarKist last Thursday, promises to find ways of using sound to lure dolphins away or out of fishing nets, he said. <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smyth </PERSON> said the company is willing to spend more if early research is fruitful. None of about 3,000 <ORGANIZATION> Heinz </ORGANIZATION> shareholders questioned <PERSON> O'Reilly </PERSON> about the dolphins issue, but they applauded warmly at a review of <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON>'s television commercials and when <PERSON> O'Reilly </PERSON> announced a two-for-one stock split and a 16.7 percent increase in quarterly dividends On other matters, <PERSON> O'Reilly </PERSON> said <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON> will not accept irradiated food from suppliers and will not use radiation in any of its food processing. Sister <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Daly </PERSON> of the Sisters of St. Dominic of <LOCATION> Caldwell </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, representing several <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> institutions holding <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON> stock, said <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON>'s policy follows a request by the Interfaith Center on Corporate Responsibility. She called <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON>'s policy `` an unprecedented move by any <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. corporation.'' <PERSON> O'Reilly </PERSON> also told reporters the company is trying to expand its food products into the `` gray market'' of senior citizens. He said <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON> believes today's consumers will be more concerned with `` health and wellness'' as they age. He declined to speculate what products or companies the food conglomerate might produce or buy.

<HEAD>Polly Peck Buying Del Monte's Fresh Fruit from RJR</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> has agreed to sell its fresh fruit operations of <ORGANIZATION> Del </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monte </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> to the British conglomerate <ORGANIZATION> Polly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peck </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> for $ 875 million in cash, both companies announced today. The sale of <ORGANIZATION> Del </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monte </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tropical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fruit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> represents the second major step by <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> toward divesting around $ 5.5 billion in food assets to help offset expenses incurred in the $ 25 billion buyout by <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roberts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> earlier this year. In June, <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> sold five European food businesses to <ORGANIZATION> BSN </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SA </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> for $ 2.5 billion. The <ORGANIZATION> Del </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monte </ORGANIZATION> unit being acquired sells bananas, pineapples, papayas, mangoes and other fresh fruits, and represents about a quarter of <ORGANIZATION> Del </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monte </ORGANIZATION>'s sales, which totaled $ 600 million last year. The acquisition, due to be completed by the end of October, is expected to boost <PERSON> Polly </PERSON> <PERSON> Peck </PERSON>'s sales by about 50 percent, according to the company. `` The acquisition of <LOCATION> Del </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Monte </LOCATION> represents a remarkable opportunity for -LRB- <PERSON> Polly </PERSON> <PERSON> Peck </PERSON> -RRB- to establish itself as one of the world's largest suppliers of fresh fruit and vegetables,'' <PERSON> Polly </PERSON> <PERSON> Peck </PERSON> Chairman <PERSON> Asil </PERSON> <PERSON> Nadir </PERSON> said in a statement. London-based <PERSON> Polly </PERSON> <PERSON> Peck </PERSON> already markets fruits and vegetables grown in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> under the brand name of <LOCATION> Sun </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zest </LOCATION>. It also has interests in electronics, textiles and hotels. <PERSON> Del </PERSON> <PERSON> Monte </PERSON> is the world's largest distributor of fresh pineapples and third largest distributor of bananas. Other Del Monte units include <ORGANIZATION> Del </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monte </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> and separate units in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Far </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerstner </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said several parties have expressed an interest in acquiring other Del Monte businesses. `` We are reviewing those proposals but there has been no final decision yet,'' he said. <PERSON> Polly </PERSON> <PERSON> Peck </PERSON> said it planned to finance the acquisition through a rights issue and bank loans.

<BYLINE>Pacific Lumber Heirs Sue Drexel Over Buyout</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>EUREKA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Three ex-heirs to the <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lumber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> have filed suit against <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, charging fraud during the financing of a hostile buyout of the company. The suit filed Wednesday in <ORGANIZATION> Humboldt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Stanwood </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, <PERSON> Suzanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> received $ 40 a share for stock that was actually worth more than $ 70 a share. It seeks $ 18 million from <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> to cover the difference. The Murphys are descendants of <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>, who bought <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lumber </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Humboldt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> in 1905. It was bought by <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> investor <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurwitz </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Maxxam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> in 1985. The suit also names as defendants former <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> junk-bond king <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> and former Wall Street financier <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>, who the suit claims secretly bought stock for <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>. The suit claims a scheme to take over the lumber company at a cheaper price was worked out in secret talks in the spring of 1985 between <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> and unnamed <ORGANIZATION> Maxxam </ORGANIZATION> officals. <PERSON> Hurwitz </PERSON> was not named as a defendant in the suit. According to the lawsuit, <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> `` knew it would be able to sell these shares to <ORGANIZATION> Maxxam </ORGANIZATION>, through <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>, at a profit,'' but did not disclose its intentions. The suit contends that at the time <ORGANIZATION> Maxxam </ORGANIZATION> was attempting the takeover, <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> filed a false affidavit indicating that it did not own any <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lumber </ORGANIZATION> stock. The suit contends <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> owned more than 5 percent of the redwood lumber company with <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> acting as its representative. Pacific Lumber's articles of incorporation required 80 percent shareholder approval of a merger deal if any stockholder owned more than 5 percent of the company. <ORGANIZATION> Maxxam </ORGANIZATION> held about 4.6 percent of the company's stock. Since <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> concealed its stake during the takeover attempt, shareholders assumed that the <ORGANIZATION> Maxxam </ORGANIZATION> bid needed only 51 percent shareholder approval, the suit contends. Many shareholders, believing they would be unable to stop a simple-majority approval, decided to sell to <ORGANIZATION> Maxxam </ORGANIZATION>, the suit maintains. The suit says that concern that the <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> affidavit was false surfaced in September of 1988 when the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> filed charges against <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> in a celebrated securities-fraud case. <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> has agreed to settle that case by pleading guilty to six felony fraud counts and paying a $ 650 million fine. <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> is serving a federal prison sentence after pleading guilty to unrelated securities-law violations. Los Angeles-based <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>, former head of <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>'s junk-bond unit, has been charged with separate securities violations. <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> officials could not be reached for comment.

 The stock market turned upward today, rebounding from Wednesday's broad decline. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials climbed 6.84 to 2,726.63 in the first half hour of trading. Gainers outnumbered losers by about 9 to 5 in the early tally of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 603 up, 352 down and 545 unchanged. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 24.07 million shares as of 10 a.m. on Wall Street. Analysts said traders had been encouraged to see the market stabilize in late trading Wednesday after an early selloff. They also noted a positive response to a strong showing by the dollar in foreign exchange today. In the last few days a debate has heated up on Wall Street over whether stocks are due for a pullback after their sharp runup to record highs this summer. The optimists argue, however, that the market's rise has not yet produced the excesses of speculation and exuberance that typically occur when prices are peaking out.

The mistakes and the glories and the victories are all a matter of public record,'' he said. <PERSON> Obermaier </PERSON>, 53, said he has none of the skeletons in the closet that have derailed some recent federal judicial nominations, as well as sitting politicians. `` I do n't think I buy outdated milk,'' he said. `` I do n't think I speed _ at least I do n't get caught at it.

The answer is indeed no.'' <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON>, who resigned Jan. 31, has been temporarily succeeded by acting <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney <PERSON> Benito </PERSON> <PERSON> Romano </PERSON>, who said he would work with <PERSON> Obermaier </PERSON> for a smooth transition and then would return to private law practice.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Miller </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brewing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> says it will stop production of its <LOCATION> Matilda </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> wine cooler in early November because of poor sales. `` From a business standpoint, it is economically imprudent for us to continue production and marketing of <LOCATION> Matilda </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Koehler </PERSON>, vice president of sales, said in a prepared statement Wednesday. <PERSON> Koehler </PERSON> said the wine cooler segment declined more than 14 percent in 1988 and industry analysts are predicting this rate of decline to continue or increase this year. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said the action would not affect employment at its brewery in <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, the only facility where <PERSON> Matilda </PERSON> <PERSON> Bay </PERSON> is produced. <PERSON> Beverly </PERSON> <PERSON> Jurkowski </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Miller </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman, said employees now working on the <LOCATION> Matilda </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> line would get jobs in other areas of the brewery.

<TEXT>
 Politics are secondary to business in sultry <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>, where teeming sidewalks, old brick mansions and bustling bars and dance halls yield few signs that police crushed mass protests two months ago. <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> residents, once famous for their business acumen in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and beyond, are more concerned about the economy than with political maneuverings to the north in the capital <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, city officials and citizens say. So far, <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> has been spared nationwide moves to suppress private entrepreneurs and capitalist ideas. Some attribute the reprieve to the protection of former <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON> <PERSON> Zemin </PERSON>, who in June replaced ousted leader <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON> as head of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> In contrast with <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, guarded by armed soldiers, <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> seems almost apolitical. The university students who led the pro-democracy demonstrations here in June face mandatory political education, but <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>'s workers have been spared that fate `` A worker's first responsibility is to produce,'' says <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> <PERSON> Xianghai </PERSON>, deputy chief of the <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Planning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. `` Our workers need to improve the quality of their work, their morality and discipline, but we're not having political education.'' <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> seems to be busy making up for time lost in June as it tries to proceed with an ambitious industrial restructuring program aimed at making the city an international economic center that would resurrect its historical preeminence in <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. Government figures show the sprawling city's industrial output has jumped by more than 77 percent over the past nine years because of economic liberalization and joint ventures with foreigners that range from medical equipment to aircraft and car assembly. But <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> remains encumbered a burgeoning population of more than 6 million people that overwhelm the decaying infrastructure of a city still crammed with crumbling 40-year-old factories. City planners say one of their main goals is to replace plants that produce cheap products like windup watches and plastic toys with industries that make high-tech goods for sale abroad. `` We want to increase our exports, which now account for only 15 percent of our total production, with high quality bicycles and electronics goods, sophisticated electrical machinery and basic industrial inputs,'' <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> says. `` We've been producing just about everything here, and it's not to our advantage. It's too disorganized,'' he says. `` We're paring away sectors that are n't much use. There are some industries we just wo n't be able to save.'' The city faces severe shortages of raw materials and energy in its efforts to modernize. An official report noted recently that many factories were closed for two or three days a week due because of insufficient electricity and other scarce resources. <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>'s mostly state-controlled industries also have suffered from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s general predicament of skyrocketing costs for raw materials while retail prices remain under strict controls. For decades, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> relied on <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>'s state-run industries to help foot the government's bill for the rest of the developing economy. The city retained little for its own upkeep. A new policy allowing <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> to use locally all but 17 percent of its tax revenues gave the city an extra 1.4 billion yuan, worth about $ 376 million at today's exchange rates, but a nationwide economic slowdown and a year-old fiscal austerity program have resulted in a 3 billion-yuan shortfall in investment funds, <PERSON> Zhu </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaohua </PERSON>, deputy director of the <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> branch of the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION>, reported recently. In the first six months of this year, the city postponed construction of 1,612 projects and slashed its total investment by 5.16 billion yuan or about $ 1.39 billion. It also stopped or restricted production of 109 products as it set priorities for using scarce resources. In a bid to scrounge additional cash, the city sent salesmen to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s remote northwestern provinces of Inner <LOCATION> Mongolia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Xinjiang </LOCATION>, where factories are n't so plentiful, to try to sell an estimated 1 billion yuan worth of excess televisions, refrigerators, washing machines and bicycles, <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> said. Plans to make <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> an international financial center also have been stymied by the lack of available cash, foreign executives and officials say. <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>'s fledgling stock exchange, where 1,625 companies have issued shares, has a total stock value of only 800 million yuan or $ 215 million. <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> says the city hopes to go ahead, however, with major renovation and modernization projects, including a new harbor, a subway system and new sewage and telephone lines, despite foreign exchange and local currency shortfalls. <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>'s government also is building satellite towns around the city and plans to raze old buildings to make way for spacious apartment blocks and green parks. Industrial centers and international hotels are sprouting amid the city's old red and gray brick mansions. <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>'s ability to pull off plans to create a modern city in the end may depend on the fate of <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>'s leaders _ urbane bureaucrats like <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> Secretary General <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Zhu </PERSON> <PERSON> Rongji </PERSON>. Some analysts attribute the city's continuing relative freedom to pursue its economic goals to <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON>'s protection. But <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON> is increasingly being seen as an interim leader whose influence at the top may be short-lived.

<HEAD>Soybean Futures Rise On Crop Forecast, Harvest Fears</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Soybean futures prices rose strongly early in today's session on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>, boosted by a bullish private crop estimate, new export sales and fears that rain could slow the harvest. Grain futures were mostly higher in early trading. Some of the soybean buying sprouted from new crop estimates released late Wednesday by <ORGANIZATION> Sparks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commodities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, Tenn.-based analytical firm, that were lower than the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s August projections. Sparks pegged the 1989 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soybean crop at 1.85 billion bushels compared with the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s 1.91-billion-bushel estimate. <PERSON> Sparks </PERSON> projected the corn harvest at 7.13 billion bushels compared with the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s August estimate of 7.35 billion. The <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> will revise its crop estimates on Tuesday. A <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> report of a sale of 200,000 metric tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soybeans to unknown destinations prompted further selling, as did fears that continued wet weather in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> could delay the corn and soybean harvest, which gets underway in about three weeks. `` The ideal weather now would be 80 degrees and dry for the next four weeks,'' said <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Zusel </PERSON>, manager of <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> floor operations for <ORGANIZATION> Balfour </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maclaine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a futures brokerage firm. In early trading, wheat futures were \ cent lower to -RCB- cents higher with the contract for delivery in September at $ 3.97 -LCB- a bushel; corn was -LCB- cent to 1 \ cents higher with September at $ 2.36 -RCB- a bushel; oats were unchanged to -RCB- cent higher with December at $ 1.46 \ a bushel; soybeans were 4 -LCB- cents to 7 cents higher with September at $ 5.94 a Cattle and pork-belly futures were higher in early trading on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> while hog futures declined. Live cattle were .05 cent to .38 cent higher with October at 72.75 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .18 cent to .43 cent higher with September at 82.35 cents a pound; live hogs were .02 cent to .10 cent lower with October at 39.57 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .50 cent to 1.38 cent higher with February at 46.20 cents a pound. All livestock and meat futures settled higher on Wednesday.

 The stock market edged upward today, rebounding from Wednesday's broad decline. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which fell 24.89 points on Wednesday, rose 1.33 to 2,721.12 by noontime today on Wall Street. Gainers outnumbered losers by about 5 to 4 in the overall tally of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 714 up, 564 down and 576 unchanged. Analysts said traders had been encouraged to see the market stabilize in late trading Wednesday after an early selloff. They also noted a positive response to a strong showing by the dollar in foreign exchange today. In the last few days a debate has heated up on Wall Street over whether stocks are due for a pullback after their sharp runup to record highs this summer.

 Talks on opening <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s closed telecommunications market to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> bogged down Thursday with both sides showing few signs of compromise, officials said. The <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> talks were called after the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> named <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> as an unfair trader in telecommunications in February under the 1988 Trade Act calling for tough retaliatory trade sanctions. The meeting began Wednesday and continued until late Thursday night but there was little chances of agreement, said officials at the <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Gordana </PERSON> <PERSON> Earp </PERSON>, the chief <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> delegate, asked <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> to announce a timetable to open its market before July 1 next year but <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> officials refused to comply, saying their telecommunications industry needs two or three more years to grow, the ministry official said. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> expressed willingness to accept parts of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s demands to open its market to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> telecommunications equipment but refused to allow direct <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> investment in the market for value-added networks, the official said <PERSON> Earp </PERSON> strongly indicated that <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> may impose trade sanctions against <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> unless its demand was fully accepted, he said. The telecommunications talks were the first in a series of intensive trade negotations scheduled in the coming months between the two countries. <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> officials are concerned that <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s trade pressure will get tougher in the coming months when <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON> and Trade Representative <PERSON> Carla </PERSON> <PERSON> Hills </PERSON> visit <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON> is scheduled to visit <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> Sunday through Tuesday to discuss wide-ranging trade issues, presumably with emphasis on <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s market-opening measures. <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON> is expected to seek to further open <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s agricultural market to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> beef and other farm products and demand <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>'s stricter protection of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intellectual property rights, Korean officials said The two countries signed an agreement for protection of intellectual property rights in 1985 but the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has complained that <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> neglected its strict enforcement. <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON> is also expected to raise a plan by <ORGANIZATION> Du </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> to construct a $ 150 million plant in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, under <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s pressure, opened its market to 243 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agricultural products in May but the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> says the action was not enough, accoring to <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> officials. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> is <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s second largest agricultural market in the world after <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. It imported $ 2.3 billion worth of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> farm products last year. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> ran a trade deficit of $ 8.5 billion with <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> last year.

 Japanese businesses are `` more anxious than ever'' to gain a foothold in <LOCATION> Britian </LOCATION> before the European Community forms a single market in 1992, <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> officials and businessmen said Thursday. `` The Japanese fear that after 1992, they will be locked out by a fortress <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharpe </PERSON>, director of investment in the government's <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Industry-Northeast </LOCATION>. `` They are more anxious than ever to get into our area before 1992 to conform with our way of doing things. Our inquiry rate is greater than ever before,'' <PERSON> Sharpe </PERSON> said. The 12-member <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> in 1992 will form the largest single market in the world, which will comprise more than 350 million people. `` The north of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> is the number one choice in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> for Japanese investment,'' said <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Fraser </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> in the North of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> -LRB- NDC -RRB-. With 33 Japanese companies operating in the area _ the majority in the last few years _ a package that includes tax incentives, investment allowances and freedom from planning restrictions for Japanese manufacturers is being offered to attract still more. Government efforts are aimed at restoring investment and jobs in areas that have suffered economically from the decline of traditional industries such as shipbuilding and coal mining, <PERSON> Sharpe </PERSON> said. The government has alloated more than 150 million pounds, or about $ 231.5 million, over the next five years to transform the industrial structure of the area and will set up a special economic enterprise in <LOCATION> Sunderland </LOCATION>, where a <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> plant is located, to attract further Japanese investment, said <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramsey </PERSON>, director of business development for the Tyne and <ORGANIZATION> Wear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corporation </ORGANIZATION>. The northern region has operated a <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> office since 1974, and its presence in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> has been `` essential'' to efforts to attract Japanese investment, <PERSON> Fraser </PERSON> told a news conference. It sponsored a one-day seminar on business opportunities in the region attended by representatives of more than 200 Japanese companies. <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Sanyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Komatsu </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> NSK </ORGANIZATION> Bearings are the leading Japanese companies with plants in northern <LOCATION> Britian </LOCATION>.

 About 2,200 <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> walked off their jobs at <ORGANIZATION> Borg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> early today after failing to reach agreement on a new three-year contract. Negotiations resumed about 8 a.m. today, said union member <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> McKibben </PERSON>, who answered the telephone at <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> Local 287, but he said he did not know how close the two sides might be to a settlement. <ORGANIZATION> Borg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> is the sole supplier of transmissions to <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and has several other long-term contracts, said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Reising </PERSON>, vice president of human resources at <ORGANIZATION> Borg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>. Those contracts could be in jeopardy if the strike continues for very long, he said. The company, which has some inventory stockpiled, met with salaried workers today to come up with a plan to resume manufacturing, he said. <PERSON> Reising </PERSON> said the company had asked the workers to pay a greater share of health insurance costs in exchange for partial ownership in the company. Hourly and salaried employees could have established 50 percent or more ownership of the operation, including seats on the baord of directors, <PERSON> Reising </PERSON> said. Salaried workers accepted the plan but the union turned it down, he said. Union officials said sticking points were insurance, pensions and wages.

 Share prices closed sharply higher Thursday on <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s stock exchange, recovering some lost ground in modest dealings after interest-rate fears abated. The FT-SE 100-share index closed at 2,415.9, up 25.1 points, or 1.04 percent. The key index had lost 35.2 points Wednesday. A narrower measure of the market, the FT-SE 30-share index, rose 19.8 to 1,998.5. The FT 500 share index rose 12.20 points to 1,350.25. Volume was modest at 508.9 million shares, down from 540.1 million Wednesday. Dealers said they saw the recovery largely as a reaction to the severity of Wednesday's drop. Dealers said there have been growing concerns over whether institutional players will aggressively buy anew, or just seek to book profits before the end of the third quarter. `` It feels good enough at the moment,'' a British dealer said of the FT-SE 100's return to levels above 2,400. `` It could go further. But a lot depends on what Wall Street does overnight.''

<HEAD>Japan Orders Construction Firms To Stop Price-Fixing</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The government said Thursday it has ordered six Japanese construction firms working on a multibillion-dollar airport project in western <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to disband a price-fixing cartel. In a similar move, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Fair </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> has ordered 24 shipbuilders to end a production cartel by October, it was reported. The actions seem to indicate <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> is responding to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> criticisms that price-fixing cartels prevent foreign firms from competing for business in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rill </PERSON>, assistant attorney general of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, told <ORGANIZATION> Fair </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Setsuo </PERSON> <PERSON> Umezawa </PERSON> in a meeting Wednesday that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> should strictly enforce the anti-monopoly law, said the <ORGANIZATION> Asahi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shimbun </ORGANIZATION>, a major national newspaper. <PERSON> Rill </PERSON> participated in Japan-U.S. trade talks earlier in the week in which <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> officials said business practices such as collusion were preventing progress in shrinking the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Umezawa </PERSON> told <PERSON> Rill </PERSON> the <ORGANIZATION> Fair </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> would take strong action against violators of laws prohibiting private monopolies and maintaining fair trade and said violators of those laws would be treated `` with a stern attitude,'' the paper reported. The <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, quoting reliable sources, said late Thursday that the <ORGANIZATION> Fair </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> had ordered 24 top shipbuilders to disband a cartel formed to help them weather a serious slump in the industry. Japanese officials were not immediately available for comment late Thursday evening. The Fair Trade Commission's order to disband the construction cartel followed a year-long investigation into a price-fixing agreement among contractors supplying sand for the <ORGANIZATION> Kansai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airport </ORGANIZATION>, said a commission official. The Kansai airport became the focus of a major dispute between <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> three years ago when <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials claimed that corporate collusion and obscure bidding procedures were preventing foreign companies from winning contracts. Construction of the $ 6.7 billion airport off <LOCATION> Osaka </LOCATION> began in January 1987, with completion of the first phase of the nation's first 24-hour commercial airport slated for 1993 <PERSON> Mitsuo </PERSON> <PERSON> Omura </PERSON>, representing the eight-company <ORGANIZATION> Offshore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reclamation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Construction </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, told a news conference in <LOCATION> Osaka </LOCATION> Wednesday the cartel was `` necessary and an appropriate method to smoothly carry out a big national project'' like the Kansai airport. But an official at major construction firm <ORGANIZATION> Ohbayashi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, speaking on condition of anonymity, said, `` We will discuss the matter with other firms a way to accept the commission's order.'' The <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> identified the members of the cartel as <ORGANIZATION> Ohbayashi </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Kajima </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Aoki </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Takenaka </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Doboku </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Saeki </PERSON> <PERSON> Kensetsu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kogyo </PERSON>, and <ORGANIZATION> Yorigami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Construction </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. The mass-circulation <ORGANIZATION> Mainichi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shimbun </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday the six firms would be fined a total of $ 2.2 million in surcharges, equivalent to 1.5 percent of the total value of sand supplied to the project. The construction association, which has two weeks to notify the antitrust agency whether it will comply with the order, faces exclusion from bidding on public works projects, including those of other local governments, the newspaper said.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> is developing a new generation nuclear power plant by adopting aspects of the first generation of commercial reactors _ smaller, simpler and believed to be safer. `` Features like this in the'90s and the next century are really going to be required for the public to have confidence in nuclear as a power source,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Slember </PERSON>, vice president and general manager of the company's energy systems business. The <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> late Wednesday confirmed it is awarding a team led by <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> $ 50 million to design a plant that could be licensed and replicated as needed by electric utilities. With a projected five-year construction schedule, costs of under $ 2 billion and simplified operation and maintenance, the new 600-megawatt advanced passive plant, or AP600, could overcome the decadelong delays, skyrocketing costs and some of the controversy involved in contemporary plants. Today's nuclear power plants, most of them significantly different from the others, are rated for 1,300 to 1,400 megawatts and cost around $ 10 billion. `` We have nothing to lose. How many people have ordered a nuclear power plant in the last 10 years? Nobody,'' <PERSON> Slember </PERSON> said late Wednesday. The AP600, a light water reactor using standard uranium fuel, will be built in large segments in factories and assembled at the permanent site, affording greater precision and higher quality. <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> leader in nuclear power plant design, hopes to have the AP600 ready to market in time for the next wave of construction in the electric utility industry. `` Many places have gone past the point where it's unlikely they can meet the power demands without brownouts no matter what they do in the short run,'' <PERSON> Slember </PERSON> said, citing <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. `` Something's got to happen.'' Success with the AP600 could also stretch the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> lead in nuclear power technology, he said. <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> on Thursday declined comment on published reports that <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> has also been picked for a $ 50 million grant to develop a similar reactor. <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> identified the members of its team as <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bridge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Iron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Bechtel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Avondale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Burns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Roe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> MK </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ferguson </ORGANIZATION> unit of <ORGANIZATION> Morrison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Knudson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. Together with the <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, the team would match the $ 50 million grant with cash and services, said <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Mimi </PERSON> <PERSON> Limbach </PERSON>. The AP600 will use sealed motor pumps, `` like the pumps used in the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Slember </PERSON> said. `` They run without maintenance for years and years. They're hermetically sealed so ... you do n't have to worry about leaks during an accident.'' The number of valves and large pumps and the length of pipe have all been reduced by 60 percent. There is 80 percent less control cable, 50 percent fewer heat exchangers and 35 percent less heating, cooling and ventilation ductwork. The portions of the powerplant that must be fortified to withstand earthquakes has been cut by 60 percent. `` If an accident occurs, if a pipe breaks, we're not dependent on a large number of pipes and valves operating to cool the reactor,'' <PERSON> Slember </PERSON> said. A large tank above the core would allow water to flow by gravity to cool the reactor, while the steel containment vessel would dissipate heat. Air, set in motion by temperature differences, would flow from the outside to pick up heat from the reactor and pass out the top of the building. `` Today, you have containment spray systems and fan coolers that depend on pumps and valves and a fair amount of electric power,'' <PERSON> Slember </PERSON> said. Contemporary cooling systems require safety grade diesel engines for backup power. <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> began considering the advanced passive design in 1984, while designing a major Japanese reactor `` with a lot of improved safety features,'' <PERSON> Slember </PERSON> said. `` What really made sense was to go back to the basics and start with a clean piece of paper.''

<HEAD>British Petroleum Chairman To Retire</HEAD>

 Sir <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Walters </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, plans to retire March 10 and will be succeeded by the former head of <ORGANIZATION> BP </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the company announced Thursday. British Petroleum, the world's third-largest oil concern in sales after <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dutch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Horton </PERSON> will replace <PERSON> Walters </PERSON> as chairman. <PERSON> Horton </PERSON>, 50, former chief executive of <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> subsidiary based in <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, was appointed deputy chairman on March 1. <PERSON> Walters </PERSON>, 58, has been managing director of the company for 17 years and chairman since 1981. He was knighted in 1984. He had been poised to step down this year and take over as chairman of <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Westminster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, but could not come to terms with the bank. He resigned from BP's board in August. Earlier this year, <PERSON> Walters </PERSON> drew criticism within the company for accepting a 48 percent increase in his compensation to 514,558 pounds, or about $ 800,000 at current exchange rates. When he became chairman in 1981, <PERSON> Walters </PERSON> said he hoped to restructure the company within 10 years and then retire. His first moves were to sharply reduce <ORGANIZATION> BP </ORGANIZATION>'s refining capacity in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, turning a $ 1 billion-a-year loss to a $ 1 billion profit within four years. Since the start of the decade, <ORGANIZATION> BP </ORGANIZATION>'s European refining capacity has been cut by 57 percent. <PERSON> Horton </PERSON> was in charge of cutting losses in <ORGANIZATION> BP </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemicals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> group. During <PERSON> Walters </PERSON>' term, <ORGANIZATION> BP </ORGANIZATION> acquired the outstanding 45 percent minority interest of <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> for $ 7.8 billion in 1987 and undertook the 2.5-billion-pound-takeover, about $ 4 billion, of Britoil last year. The full takeover of <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> has allowed <ORGANIZATION> BP </ORGANIZATION> to integrate its <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> operations under <ORGANIZATION> BP </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, and to call off a disastrous exploration program that cost Standard billions of dollars. Half of <ORGANIZATION> BP </ORGANIZATION>'s assets are now in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The acquisition of Britoil gave BP a major stake in the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> as a hedge against declining production. Although the company has said it can maintain production of 1.7 million barrels a day until the mid-1990s, its two main oil fields, Forties in the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Prudhoe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, have both peaked. <PERSON> Walters </PERSON>, a native of <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION> in central <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, joined <ORGANIZATION> BP </ORGANIZATION> in 1954 and was involved mainly with the company's international oil supply organization, including assignments to the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> office in 1960-62 and, as vice-president of <ORGANIZATION> BP </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, in 1965-67. In 1971 he was appointed <ORGANIZATION> BP </ORGANIZATION>'s regional director for the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hemisphere </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australasia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Far </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. He was named deputy chairman in 1980. The company did not announce <PERSON> Walters </PERSON>' plans following retirement. <PERSON> Horton </PERSON> joined <ORGANIZATION> BP </ORGANIZATION> in 1957, and was appointed general manager of the <ORGANIZATION> BP </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tanker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in 1975. The next year, he was appointed general manager of <ORGANIZATION> BP </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Corporate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Planning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. In 1980 he became chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION> BP </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemicals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>. He was elected to the board in December 1983 as a managing director with responsibility for finance, planning and the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hemisphere </LOCATION>. He resigned from British Petroleum in 1986 to become chairman and chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION>. Following the merger of <ORGANIZATION> BP </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> in 1987, he was appointed chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION> BP </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>. In February, <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> reported that after-tax profit in 1988 fell 13 percent to 1.21 billion pounds on an historical cost basis from 1.39 billion pounds in 1987. Current cost after-tax profit rose 10 percent to 1.44 billion pounds, or about $ 2.55 billion, from 1.31 billion pounds. Per-share earnings declined to 20 pence, or 35 cents, from 24.9 pence. Sales for the year fell 8 percent to 25.9 billion pounds from 28.3 billion pounds a year earlier.

<HEAD>Toy Companies Bet Big on Super Fast Cars</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 As American kids grow bored with video games and stop buying them, toy companies are hoping to pick up the slack by importing the latest craze from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>: 6-inch model cars that move at the equivalent, when scaled up to full size, of 320 miles per hour. But executives who gathered in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> for a toy industry conference Thursday expressed one nagging doubt about their new `` hyper cars.'' The darn things move so fast, how can kids possibly play with them? `` It's a real problem,'' conceded <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bloom </PERSON>, vice president for finance at <ORGANIZATION> Matchbox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> `` You put it down on the rug and let it go, and it's just going to shoot off and keep going until it hits something or flips over.'' The $ 5 to $ 12 cars, powered by two or three AA batteries, move at actual speeds of about 10 miles per hour. But in comparison with their scale, which is 1-32 of a full-sized car, they easily outrun Formula I racers. Matchbox and its major competitors _ <ORGANIZATION> Hasbro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Mattel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Tonka </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> _ plan to spend a total of $ 20 million to $ 25 million by Christmas to promote the flashy vehicles, most of which are just now hitting retail stores. It's an unusually late product introduction for the industry, and a marketing gamble driven by equal parts of excitement and worry. At the International Toy Fair in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> in January, when new products traditionally are unveiled, <ORGANIZATION> Mattel </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Tonka </ORGANIZATION> displayed their super-fast cars but were virtually ignored by retailers. Since then, however, two things have happened. One is that the cars have taken off in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, selling an estimated 45 million units and whetting the appetites of American toy store chains. The other is that the $ 2 billion-a-year market for video games may have peaked, and no `` hot'' new toys have emerged since <ORGANIZATION> Cabbage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dolls </ORGANIZATION> and the board game Trivial Pursuit racked up hundreds of millions of dollars in sales in the mid-1980s. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shank </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Tonka </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s chief executive officer, told the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> toy conference that he expects `` an orderly decline'' in video game sales starting next year, and <ORGANIZATION> Tonka </ORGANIZATION> has decided to drop its Sega video line in 1990. The last time there was a downturn in video games, in 1980-81, several toy companies' profits plunged and `` it got pretty bloody out there,'' said <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Eisenberg </PERSON>, a toy industry analyst for the investment firm of <ORGANIZATION> Bear </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stearns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the conference's sponsor. To avoid such a debacle again, toymakers have been casting about for something with enough sparkle to pull parents and children back into the toy stores. `` The industry has lacked a hot product for two years, and everyone thinks this -LRB- hyper car -RRB- thing could be it,'' said <PERSON> Bruno </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferretti </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Tons </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Toys </ORGANIZATION>, a chain of 25 stores in the Northeast. The cars come in numerous designs, inclding some with interchangeable motors and gear boxes. Although they are being marketed under various names, such as Hyper-Drivers and Record Breakers, most versions are made in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and are nearly identical in construction. Toymakers hope to solve the problem of how to play with the speeding vehicles by selling plastic track that kids can put together in their bedrooms, garages or backyards. In <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, arcades have installed elaborate tracks that junior racers pay to use. But some toy executives are doubtful the same thing will happen in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Tyco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Toys </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the leading maker of slot cars and radio-controlled vehicles, has decided to sit out the craze. `` We do n't think it's a good product, we do n't think it has good play value, and we do n't think it's going to be successful,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tyco </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Grey </PERSON> told the industry conference. `` We're prepared to be wrong But we're also willing to stand up and be counted.''

<HEAD>No More Bananas: RJR Sells Del Monte's Fresh Fruit Business</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday it would sell the fresh fruit operations of <LOCATION> Del </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Monte </LOCATION> to the British conglomerate <ORGANIZATION> Polly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peck </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> for $ 875 million in another major step toward reducing debt from its record buyout. The cash sale of <ORGANIZATION> Del </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monte </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tropical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fruit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> moves <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> past the halfway mark in its efforts to sell about $ 5.5 billion in assets to reduce the debt accumulated in the $ 25 billion buyout of the food and tobacco giant by <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roberts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co.. <PERSON> Del </PERSON> <PERSON> Monte </PERSON> is the world's largest supplier of fresh pineapples and No 3 in bananas. Its acquisition would make <PERSON> Polly </PERSON> <PERSON> Peck </PERSON> a major player in the fresh fruit industry by allowing it to use the well-known Del Monte brand name on its entire range of produce. <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION>'s plan to divest assets, particularly among its food holdings, began in June, when it sold five European food businesses for $ 2.5 billion to <ORGANIZATION> BSN </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> SA </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, and its <ORGANIZATION> Chun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> King </ORGANIZATION> unit for $ 52 million to a <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> syndicate. The following month it sold its biscuit and food businesses in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> for $ 44 million. `` We are significantly ahead of schedule in completing that plan,'' said <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerstner </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> said the amount received for the fresh fruit business was about 13 times the unit's projected 1989 operating income, a price tag generally in line with analysts' expectations. `` I'd say it's a good price. Of course, it's not as good as what they extracted from the -LRB- European -RRB- snack food operations,'' said <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, of the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> securities firm <PERSON> Sanford </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernstein </PERSON>. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Wheat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, said he expected <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> to proceed with plans to sell the rest of <LOCATION> Del </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Monte </LOCATION> as well, including <ORGANIZATION> Del </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monte </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> and separate units in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Far </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. He predicted the remainder of the division would fetch between $ 1.5 billion and $ 2 billion. <ORGANIZATION> Del </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monte </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tropical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fruit </ORGANIZATION>, with $ 600 million in sales of pineapples, bananas, papayas, mangoes and other fresh fruits last year, accounted for about a quarter of <ORGANIZATION> Del </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monte </ORGANIZATION>'s total sales. <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> had total revenue of $ 7.44 billion for the first six months of 1989. <PERSON> Gerstner </PERSON> acknowledged <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> already has received inquiries about acquiring other <PERSON> Del </PERSON> <PERSON> Monte </PERSON> businesses, `` but there has been no final decision yet.'' <PERSON> Polly </PERSON> <PERSON> Peck </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Del </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Monte </LOCATION> acquisiton is expected to boost its sales by 50 percent. `` The acquisition of <LOCATION> Del </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Monte </LOCATION> represents a remarkable opportunity for -LRB- <PERSON> Polly </PERSON> <PERSON> Peck </PERSON> -RRB- to establish itself as one of the world's largest suppliers of fresh fruit and vegetables,'' said <PERSON> Polly </PERSON> <PERSON> Peck </PERSON> Chairman Asil Nadir. `` The two businesses are truly complementary: PPI is strong in citrus fruits and in many European markets, whereas <ORGANIZATION> Del </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monte </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fresh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fruit </ORGANIZATION> is strong in bananas and pineapples and in the American and Far Eastern markets.'' <PERSON> Polly </PERSON> <PERSON> Peck </PERSON> said it planned to finance the acquisition through a rights issue and from bank loans. It said it hopes to complete the deal by Oct. 26. The rights issue will allow existing shareholders to buy new <PERSON> Polly </PERSON> <PERSON> Peck </PERSON> shares at 245 pence, or $ 3.77, about 20 percent below their recent trading range. The London-based company also has operations in electronics, textiles and hotels. Its sales totaled $ 804 million for the first six months of this year.

 The stock market edged upward today, bidding to rebound from Wednesday's broad decline. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which fell 24.89 points on Wednesday, rose 2.28 to 2,722.07 by 3 p.m. today on Wall Street. Gainers outnumbered losers by about 7 to 6 in the overall tally of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 753 up, 645 down and 575 unchanged. Analysts said traders had been encouraged to see the market stabilize in late trading Wednesday after an early selloff. They also noted a positive response to a strong showing by the dollar in foreign exchange today. In the last few days a debate has heated up on Wall Street over whether stocks are due for a pullback after their sharp runup to record highs this summer. The optimists argue, however, that the market's rise has not yet produced the excesses of speculation and exuberance that typically occur when prices are peaking out. <ORGANIZATION> Allergan </ORGANIZATION> led the active list, down 3 | at 20 The company said its sales this year would n't grow as much as it previously projected.

<HEAD>Soybean Futures Rise On Increased Exports, Crop Estimate</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Soybean futures prices posted strong gains Thursday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>, boosted by perceptions of increased foreign demand for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soy products and by a private crop analysts' bullish harvest forecast. Grain futures closed mixed. The export news came from three directions, beginning with the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s announcement late Wednesday that 200,000 metric tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soybeans had been sold to unknown destinations. Traders speculated the beans were bound for <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. Rumors that the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> would grant <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> $ 80 million in credit to purchase <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soybean oil prompted further buying in the soybean complex, as did talk that a vegetable oil sale to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> was in the works. The soybean market also was supported by new crop estimates by <ORGANIZATION> Sparks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commodities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, Tenn.-based analytical firm, that were lower than the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s August projections. Sparks pegged the 1989 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soybean crop at 1.85 billion bushels compared with the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s 1.91 billion-bushel estimate. <PERSON> Sparks </PERSON> projected the corn harvest at 7.13 billion bushels compared with the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s August estimate of 7.35 billion. The <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> will revise its crop estimates on Tuesday. If <PERSON> Sparks </PERSON>' estimates prove correct, soybean prices may be headed for an extended stay above $ 6 a bushel, said <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connell </PERSON>, a grain market analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Refco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. At the close, wheat futures were 1 \ cents lower to 1 -RCB- cents higher with September at $ 3.97 a bushel; corn was 1 cent lower to 1 \ cents higher with September at $ 2.36 -RCB- a bushel; oats were -RCB- cent to 2 cents higher with September at $ 1.36 \ a bushel; soybeans were 3 -LCB- cents to 9 -RCB- cents higher with September at $ 5.97

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Agriculture Secretary <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> met on Thursday with <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> officials but appeared to make little headway in solving some tough problems separating the giant trading partners. Both sides reported the talks were constructive, but neither indicated any moves to settle their disputes over European agricultural subsidies and a European ban on imports of hormone-treated beef from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Even so, <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> told reporters he was `` mildly encouraged'' that the current round of international trade negotiations could be wrapped up on schedule, by the end of 1990. Those talks, called the <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Round </LOCATION>, are being held under the auspices of the 96-nation General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade. Earlier, <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> MacSharry </PERSON>, the top agricultural official for the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>, raised the possibility that the two sides' dispute over the trading bloc's ban on beef from cattle treated with growth hormones might be easing The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has refused to comply with the prohibition, arguing the hormones used by its farmers are safe. It has retaliated with stiff duties on some European imports. <PERSON> MacSharry </PERSON> said more than 200 feedlots in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and about 10 slaughterhouses have been approved to ship hormone-free beef to the 12 nations of the community. A major packing company also has shown in interest in gaining approval for its products, he said. The recent shipments of hormone-free beef would amount to about $ 9 million if stretched out over 12 months, according to community estimates. As a result, <PERSON> MacSharry </PERSON> said he expected an easing of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sanctions shortly. <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON>, however, described the recent shipments of high-quality beef as nominal and said they did not include the lower grades which make up about 80 percent or 85 percent of the disputed meat sent to the community. `` We've still only solved about 15 percent of the problem,'' he said. <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> also said governments should wait for the results of scientific studies on another hormone, bovine somatatropin or BST, before deciding whether to ban its use. <ORGANIZATION> BST </ORGANIZATION> boosts the milk yield of a cow. <PERSON> MacSharry </PERSON> has proposed that the community hold off making a decision on the hormone until the end of 1990. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> and other nations are tackling agricultural policies as part of the <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION> Round talks. A sticking point has been an American demand for the community to get rid of import barriers and export and domestic farm subsidies that it says distort trade. To do that, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has suggested to <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> that steps be taken to convert subsidies or other trade barriers into tariffs so that these duties could then be negotiated to lower levels. The idea is to quantify the restrictions in order to reduce them. <PERSON> MacSharry </PERSON> said that plan was `` of major concern to us.'' If such action were taken to reduce support for European farmers, he said, the community would have to look at ways of slapping tariffs on `` an enormous amount'' of products that now enter the trading bloc duty free. <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON>, in turn, said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was `` vigorously opposed'' to those tariff adjustments, known as `` rebalancing.'' `` What is proposed by the community constitutes increased protectionism rather than icreased trade liberalization,'' he said. <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> was scheduled to travel to <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> before returning to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.

 Government farm programs must encourage alternative methods of food production that save the soil and use fewer chemical fertilizers, weedkillers and pesticides, a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> report said Thursday. Federal farm policies `` have generally made a plentiful food supply a higher priority than protection'' of the nation's soil and water resources, the report said. Instead of supporting `` environmentally benign'' ways of producing food, the report said, government programs have worked against those alternative methods. <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Worthington </PERSON>, a coordinator for Americans for a Safe Food, a subsidiary of the private, non-profit Center for Science in the <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interest </ORGANIZATION>, said she agreed with the report's charge that government farm policies have been an impediment. `` Some of the basic agricultural policies that have been in motion almost since World War II have pushed the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> farmer into a high-chemical -LRB- method of -RRB- farming and makes it difficult, if not impossible, for the farmer to move into more sustainable practices,'' she said. <PERSON> Worthington </PERSON>'s group earlier this year released a study showing that efforts to promote organic and low-chemical farming `` is flourishing at the state level,'' while the federal effort is moving slowly. The latest report, `` Alternative Agriculture,'' came after a three-year $ 625,000 study by a 17-member committee headed by <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Pesek </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Iowa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. The council is an agency of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> and Engineering. As used in the 450-page report, alternative agriculture is not a single system of farm production with a siple list of do's and do n'ts It is a generic term that includes a wide range of methodology and labels _ organic, biological, low-input, regenerative, sustainable. The <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> uses its own acronym _ <LOCATION> LISA </LOCATION>, for low-input, sustainable agriculture _ in a bid to help farmers find lower-cost ways of producing crops and livestock while helping protect the environment. Assistant Secretary <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hess </PERSON> said at <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has already authorized a number of program changes to give more choices to farmers and that flexibility will be an important part of drafting a 1990 farm bill to replace the 1985 law. <PERSON> Hess </PERSON> told reporters that the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> also has expanded its work in <ORGANIZATION> IPM </ORGANIZATION>, or integrated pest management, which uses a variety of methods to control crop pests instead of the old practice of dousing fields with pesticides. The report recommended that the department boost its spending on <ORGANIZATION> LISA </ORGANIZATION> to at least $ 40 million a year from the current level of $ 4.45 million. <PERSON> Hess </PERSON> said the total <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> research budget is about $ 1.2 billion this year and that a substantial upgrading of that is under review. <PERSON> Hess </PERSON> acknowledged that there has been `` a major step forward in the last five years'' in the recognition of alternative farm methods. This has been a `` shared repsonsibility'' of <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>, the land-grant universities and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, he said. Only a few of the nation's 2.17 million farms have adopted entire alternative systems of production. But the report said the need is there and that bits and pieces have been successfully used. <PERSON> Hess </PERSON> said there is `` no magic formula, and the practices will vary from farm to farm.'' Crop rotations, in which soil-building crops are grown after the production of corn or other grain for several years, are examples of alternative methods. The conventional method might call for the same crop year after year, with farmers heaping on costly chemicals to boost production. `` Many federal policies discourage adoption of alternative practices and systems by economically penalizing those who adopt rotations, apply certain soil conservation systems, or attempt to reduce pesticide applications,'' the report said. `` Federal programs often tolerate and sometimes encourage unrealistically high yield goals, inefficient fertilizer and pesticide use, and unsustainable use of land and water,'' it said. `` Many farmers in these programs manage their farms to maximize present and future program benefits, sometimes at the expense of environmental quality.'' A primary goal of commodity program reform should be `` the removal of the existing disincentives'' that discourage alternative methods of production. `` This step would ensure that farmers who employ crop rotations and recommended resource conservation practices are not deprived of farm-income support,'' the report said. Thus, it added, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would have to revise existing programs to eliminate penalties for farmers adopting crop rotations, and to allow more flexibility in substituting or adjusting acreage allotments to accommodate rotations. The American Farmland Trust, a non-profit conservation group based in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said the report `` documents the compatibility of economic concerns and conservation measures'' on the nation's farms `` Today many farmers successfully implement safe, sustainable agricultural practices,'' said <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Grossi </PERSON>, AFT president. `` However, there is no widespread coordination of these efforts.'' The study was financed mainly by a $ 410,000 grant from the W.K. <ORGANIZATION> Kellogg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>. Other private contributors put up the balance, and the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> provided $ 80,000.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said Thursday he will vigorously oppose a capital-gains tax cut, which he called a giveaway to the rich that would have to be financed by middle-income taxpayers. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said he favors preferential tax treatment for capital gains, but only as part of a fair, progressive tax structure that would include raising the maximum tax rate paid by wealthier Americans on all types of income. `` The present proposal is unfair, unwise and will increase the deficit,'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, told reporters. `` It will require middle-class taxpayers to make up that tax break for the wealthy.'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> cited estimates that on average, a capital-gains reduction would be worth $ 31,000 a year to a person with income over $ 200,000. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> is expected to approve a capital-gains cut next week. Until passage of the 1986 tax overhaul, capital gains _ which are profits from the sale of stock and other investments _ were taxed at a lower rate than other income. But the capital-gains preference _ as well as such breaks as deductions for sales taxes and universal <ORGANIZATION> Individual </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Retirement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounts </ORGANIZATION> _ was taken away so that tax rates on all kinds of income could be cut significantly. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> promised during the campaign last year to restore the preference for capital gains, arguing such action would spur investment and saving. He has asked <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to cut the maximum capital-gains rate, now 33 percent, to 15 percent. A compromise reduction, which has the president's support, was proposed by Rep. <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON>, D-Ga. It would cut the top rate for 2 -LCB- years to 20 percent, then raise it permanently to 28 percent and ensure that profits caused solely by inflation would not be taxed. <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON>' plan has the backing of a bare majority of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, but the panel's <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> leadership has delayed a vote in an effort to win support for a third plan. Offered by Rep. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ill </LOCATION>., the new proposal would `` index'' the value of investments so that inflation-caused gain would not be taxed But it would go a big step further for assets held for five or more years, exempting from taxation as much as half the price for which such an investment is sold. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said that because of the budget deficit, this is not the time to consider any cut in capital-gains taxes. Asked if he is `` prepared to go to the mat'' in opposition to a cut, he stomped his foot and replied `` yes.'' He said that if a preference is voted for capital gains, that would increase pressure to restore other breaks that were taken away in the 1986 overhaul. Coincidentally, Sens. <PERSON> Alfonse </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Conn </LOCATION>., introduced a bill Thursday that would restore slightly modified but fully deductible IRAs for all workers A worker, regardless of income, could avoid tax on up to $ 2,000 per year contributed to an <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>; one with an unemployed spouse could contribute another $ 1,000. The worker would be allowed a tax credit for 15 percent of the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> contribution. Thus, one who made the maximum $ 2,000 contribution could save $ 300 in taxes. The 1986 law retained fully deductible IRAs only for those not covered by a company pension regardless of income, and couples earning less than $ 35,000 and single workers earning less than $ 25,000.

 The head of <ORGANIZATION> Fluorocarbon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, who felt like a corporate <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Capone </PERSON> because people wrongly thought his products zapped the ozone layer, said Thursday he's received more than 9,000 entries in his contest to rename the company. The safe-sounding suggestions, from <LOCATION> Fluoroseals </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Notox </LOCATION> to <ORGANIZATION> Pro-Ozone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> to <ORGANIZATION> Oat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, came in letters from points as farflung as <LOCATION> Stuttgart </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, to a couple of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> jails, said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Churm </PERSON>, chairman of the <LOCATION> Laguna </LOCATION> Niguel-based company. `` One of the jailbirds was in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> and one was in the <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> pokey,'' <PERSON> Churm </PERSON> said. `` The guy from the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Jail apologized that he could n't have it typed.'' <PERSON> Churm </PERSON> decided to rename Fluorocarbon this year after brokers balked at pitching the stock to investors. The problem: A lot of people confused Fluorocarbon with chlorofluorocarbons, the compounds that are believed to erode the ozone layer that screens cancer-causing ultraviolet rays. In fact, the smallish company -LRB- $ 250 million in 1988 sales -RRB- makes custom seals, gaskets, bearings and the like from <LOCATION> Teflon </LOCATION> and related plastics known as fluorocarbons. <ORGANIZATION> Whirlpool </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Navistar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> are among Churm's customers, and Fluorocarbon seals are even used in the space shuttle. The deadline for postmarked entries was Aug. 31, so Churm figured nearly all of them had arrived by Thursday. `` As of this morning, we've had 3,647 letters with somewhere between 9,000 and 10,000 suggestions altogether,'' he said. Some suggestions were silly: Not <ORGANIZATION> Chlorofluorocarbon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, Fiber-Fab, <ORGANIZATION> Seals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> R </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Us </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Fluoraluralura </PERSON>. `` And any with American, <LOCATION> Laguna </LOCATION>, or my name will be instantly eliminated,'' <PERSON> Churm </PERSON> said. There went The <ORGANIZATION> Churminators </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Laguna </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Buna </LOCATION>. A committee headed by <PERSON> Churm </PERSON> will winnow the entries to 10 in the next couple of weeks. Then the lawyers will get busy starting with the first name until they find one that is n't yet taken by another company. The winner should be announced by late October. The prize is 100 shares of Fluorocarbon stock, which has been trading at about $ 16 per share. `` We'll do something special for the winner,'' <PERSON> Churm </PERSON> said. The flood of entries became so huge this summer after the Great Name Change was announced that Fluorocarbon assigned two workers to the contest, one hired temporarily to feed names into a computer. Most employees will be glad when it's over. `` It's been a bit overwhelming,'' <PERSON> Churm </PERSON> said. `` We're set up to be a manufacturing company, not some PR firm.''

 White House economic adviser <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boskin </PERSON> on Thursday reinforced the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration's call on the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> to lower interest rates. `` My own personal view is if there are signs of softness in the economy from where we are now, that further easing would probably be appropriate,'' said <PERSON> Boskin </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisers </ORGANIZATION>. `` We see the economy is continuing to grow, albeit at a slower rate than the fairly rapid pace of 1987 and 1988,'' he said. His remarks at a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> breakfast came three weeks after <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> budget director <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> complained that the central bank was keeping interest rates too high and would have to bear the blame if the country toppled into a recession after nearly seven years of economic expansion. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> later endorsed <PERSON> Darman </PERSON>'s statement, calling it `` very balanced.'' <PERSON> Boskin </PERSON> has generally avoided publicly criticizing the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>, which is considered an independent branch of government, and his statement was muted compared to <PERSON> Darman </PERSON>'s remarks. `` Picking fights between the administration and the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> is the best game in town and I do n't really intend to get involved. I think that's counterproductive,'' <PERSON> Boskin </PERSON> said. `` I'm sure the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> is monitoring the data as closely as we are and I'm certain they will adopt a sensible monetary policy because they themselves have said that their goal is to try to achieve the maximum sustainable economic growth consistent with controlling inflation,'' he said. Beginning in March 1988, the central bnk boosted short-term interest rates by 3 percentage points. Its goal was a so-called `` soft landing'' _ slower but continued economic growth that would prevent an acceleration of inflation. Then, when signs of sluggishness began to emerge, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> in June began loosening credit, allowing rates to fall by about three-quarters of a percentage point. However, recent statistics indicate the economy, although slower than last year, was doing better than most economists thought. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> has not nudged interest rates down further since mid-July, causing some impatience within the administration, which is depending on continued growth to generate tax revenue and help it reduce the budget deficit without a tax increase. `` We would not be satisfied with a definition of soft landing that merely avoids a recession,'' <PERSON> Boskin </PERSON> said. `` The economy can and should do better than that. It should sustain growth sufficient to provide rising employment and real income to Americans.''

 A bankruptcy judge on Thursday pulled former <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> financier <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Warner </PERSON>'s case out of liquidation and restored it to Chapter 11 reorganization so creditors can decide on a proposed $ 16 million settlement. The creditors are expected to vote on the plan within the next few weeks, and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ankrutpcy Judge <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Proctor </PERSON> scheduled a Sept. 27 hearing in <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION> to confirm the tally. The judge approved a motion to return <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>'s case to Chapter 11 protection from the liquidation he'd ordered on July 31, saying, `` The court does not plan to throw a monkey wrench'' in the proposed settlement filed earlier this week in court. Under the plan, <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> would immediately pay $ 10 million and make three annual $ 2 million payments beginning with the first anniversary of the plan's approval. <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> also will pay all legal fees and administrative costs, and an estimated $ 2 million in taxes associated with liquidation of assets to pay the settlement. <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>, 70, has been the target of a flood of lawsuits following the collapse of his Cincinnati-based <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in March 1985. He filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in October 1987 against creditors seeking more than $ 4.5 billion. <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> was convicted on <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> felony charges in Home State's collapse but was acquitted of federal charges in a separate trial He is appealing the state conviction and a restitution order. Home State collapsed four days after Fort Lauderdale-based <ORGANIZATION> ESM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> was shut down by federal regulators for insolvency. Home State had invested heavily with <ORGANIZATION> ESM </ORGANIZATION> through securities trades and lost $ 144 million when <ORGANIZATION> ESM </ORGANIZATION> was closed. The creditors, most of whom have already agreed to the settlement, will formally vote on the plan before attending the hearing in <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION>. At that hearing, the judge will determine whether it was approved by all classes of creditors and whether it meets the requirements of the bankruptcy law. If that is the case, he will sign an order confirming the plan and it will go into effect.

 The stock market lost ground for the third straight session today, yielding to a late round of selling. In the last few days a debate has heated up on Wall Street over whether stocks are due for a pullback after their sharp runup to record highs this summer. The optimists argue that the market's rise has not yet produced the excesses of speculation and exuberance that typically occur when prices are peaking out. But talk persists of an impending `` correction'' as traders seek to cash in profits built up over the first eight months of the year. Brokers say stocks have also been weighed down by doubts that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> will take any further steps in the near future to relax its credit policy.

 Assets of the nation's 463 money market mutual funds rose by $ 1.26 billion in the latest week to a new record of $ 344.65 billion, the <ORGANIZATION> Investment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday. It was the 10th straight weekly all-time high and reflected the growing popularity of such investments despite a recent trend toward lower interest rates. The rise in the seven-day period ended Wednesday followed a $ 53.7 million rise in fund assets the previous week, the Washington-based mutual fund trade group said. In the latest week, assets of 227 general purpose funds rose $ 770.1 million to $ 110.68 billion, assets of 95 broker-dealer funds increased $ 1.04 billion to $ 149.21 billion, and assets of 141 institutional funds declined $ 557.1 million to $ 84.77 billion, the institute said.

The 30-day average yield fell to 8.30 percent from 8.32 percent, <PERSON> Donoghue </PERSON>'s said. The average maturity of the portfolios held by money funds was 37 days, down from 38 days, <PERSON> Donoghue </PERSON>'s said. The newsletter Bank Rate Monitor said its survey of 100 leading commercial banks, savings and loan associations and savings banks in the nation's 10 largest markets showed the effective annual yield available on money market accounts fell to 6.45 percent as of Wednesday from 6.46 percent a week earlier. The <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, Fla.-based newsletter said the effective annual yield available on special savings accounts, called Super NOW accounts, was unchanged at 5.11 percent.

 Defense lawyers portray a former <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> director who admitted leaking secret data as a generous `` country banker'' seduced into the crime by a friend. A memorandum submitted Wednesday to the judge preparing to sentence <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> A. Rough described the ex-banker as a man shattered by betraying his trust. His attorneys asked for probation and a sentence of 200 hours of community service at <LOCATION> Newton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Memorial </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, where the 50-year-old man would be willing to perform the `` most demeaning manual tasks.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Debevoise </PERSON> could impose up to five years in prison at sentencing Sept. 13. The government has recommended no more than one year. Rough, while president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sussex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION>, sat on the board of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> from 1982 to 1984. In a plea agreement with the government last June, he admitted regularly disclosing advance word on <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> recommendations to the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> regarding the discount rate. Several times he revealed actual <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> decisions on the rate. Federal authorities called the case the first to involve insider trading of government securities, and the first such charges against a director in the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> system. The discount rate, which is the interest the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> charges on loans to member banks, can have a powerful effect on the securities market. Rough gave the information to principals of the now-defunct brokerage firm <PERSON> Bevill </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Bresler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Schulman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, and the government claims they used it to reap millions in profits and avoid losses. Five top executives, including company president <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schulman </PERSON>, who was Rough's neighbor and friend, were implicated in the firm's 1985 collapse and sent to prison. <PERSON> Schulman </PERSON> was described in the defense attorneys' memo as a `` nefarious individual well-known to this court ... the consummate flim-flam artist.'' The memo said <PERSON> Schulman </PERSON> saw Rough's position on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s board as a chance to profit `` Accordingly, <PERSON> Schulman </PERSON> constantly prodded, poked, cajoled and pleaded with Rough'' to reveal discount-rate data, the memo said. In his own statement to <ORGANIZATION> Debevoise </ORGANIZATION>, Rough blamed his actions on `` misguided notions of friendship;'' the `` rationalization'' that the discount rate was a market follower; and the fact that 11 other regional banks made recommendations. But Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Weissman </PERSON>, who handled the case, argued, `` Nobody twisted his arm. It was Rough's decision to reveal the information.'' <PERSON> Weissman </PERSON>, in his memo, had called Rough's actions `` serious criminal behavior'' by someone who `` grossly abused'' his position. The government charged that Rough was given $ 47,000 in interest-deferred loans in exchange for the information, but added in its memo that Rough probably did n't see the loans as a payback, only as unrelated personal loans from <PERSON> Schulman </PERSON>. Along with Rough's apologies to <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> officials and admission that he abused his trust, Rough's memo detaile how he `` has seen his entire world crumble before his eyes.'' From successful `` country banker'' _ the third generation of his family in banking _ who counseled the community, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jersey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> and local <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> director, Rough has lost his profession and is `` virtually penniless,'' said the memo. A supportor's letter cited $ 250,000 in legal fees. His wife has filed for divorce and his two sons, age 18 and 20, are unemployed and frequently in trouble with the law, it said. `` My career is finished in disgrace; I have tainted the Fed which I so revered; I have brought shame to my family; and finally my life is in personal and financial ruins,'' he wrote.

 <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> tax-writers, yielding to loud complaints from many older Americans, indicated Thursday they would join their <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> counterparts and go along with major changes in Medicare insurance covering the costs of a catastrophic illness. Several members of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, however, rejected a revision approved by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> to cut costs for the higher-income elderly but raise them for older people with lower incomes. `` I want to make it clear at the outset that, as chairman, I will oppose any increase in the flat premium paid by retirees of modest means,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, who heads the <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. `` We should neither repeal ... -LRB- catastrophic coverage -RRB- nor shift a greater share of costs ... to beneficiaries who can least afford them,'' said Sen. Spark <PERSON> Matsunaga </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Hawaii </LOCATION>. Meanwhile, Republican congressional leaders met with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> at the White House. Sen. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Domenici </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.M. </LOCATION>, told reporters afterward that several of the lawmakers told <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> the catastrophic care act `` ought to be repealed in toto.'' The program, enacted barely a year ago, is under heavy fire from some older Americans who say they do n't need the protection and from others _ mainly those with higher incomes _ who object that the coverage is financed only by the elderly and not by all taxpayers. About two-thirds of the cost of the catastrophic care insurance program is paid by the 41 percent of older citizens whose incomes are high enough that they owe federal income tax of more than $ 150. They pay a surtax of 15 percent on income tax above $ 150; about 1.8 million of the 33 million Medicare beneficiaries will pay the maximum surtax of $ 800 this year. The surtax rate is due to increase to 28 percent and the maximum surtax to $ 1,050 by 1993. The rest of the cost is financed through a flat fee of $ 4 per month per retiree. That fee is due to rise to $ 10.20 by 1993. Complaints from the elderly prompted the <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> to reduce some catastrophic care benefits, cut the surtax rate by half and raise the flat monthly fee significantly. Those changes have not been enough to mollify the protesters, as Rep. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON>, D-Ill., the Ways and Means chairman, learned; he was chased down a street in his hometown of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> by angry retirees last month `` You almost have a sense when you go home of being unwanted, unloved and unappreciated on this issue,'' Sen. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Packwood </PERSON>, R-Ore., told colleagues Thursday The <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> is likely to begin voting on how to change the program Friday. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration said it would prefer no change at all, but <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Diefenderfer </PERSON>, deputy director of the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION>, conceded `` that does n't seem to be what's going to happen. <PERSON> Diefenderfer </PERSON> noted that repeal of catastrophic care coverage would worsen the federal deficit in 1990 by as much as $ 7 billion because taxes earmarked for the program come in faster than benefits are paid out. Killing the program would automatically trigger across-the-board cuts in most federal spending. There is considerable support in the House for outright repeal of catastrophic care insurance, an idea that drew the support of Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Danforth </PERSON>, R-Mo. `` I question the kind of commitment we made last year,'' he said, noting the program leans toward long-term hospital care. `` This is n't something they -LRB- older Americans -RRB- want,'' <PERSON> Danforth </PERSON> said. `` It's something they fear ..., being hooked up'' to life-support equipment and the like. The <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> staff outlined seven options for changing catastrophic care coverage, most of which would require retirees to pay a larger share of expenses but also allow them to reject the insurance _ but only if they also drop Medicare Part B, which covers physicians' fees. The panel has two basic proposals for changing the way the program is financed: _ Freeze the surtax rate at 10 or 15 percent and reduce the maximum annual surtax to $ 585 This would require retirees to continue paying most of the costs of coverage. _ Require non-retirees to pay a share of the cost of catastrophic insurance by raising to $ 60,000 the $ 48,000 maximum amount of wages subject to the 1.45 percent Medicare hospitalization tax The tax, paid as part of the Social Security tax through payroll deductions, is matched by the employer.

 Stock prices showed some spotty declines Thursday after a modest early rally attempt failed to attract much support. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up about eight points in the early going, was down 12.91 at 2,706.88 by the close. That extended its loss over the last three sessions to 45.21 points. Advancing issues and declines ran about even in nationwide trading of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Stock Exchange-listed stocks, with 713 up, 714 down and 569 unchanged. Volume on the floor of the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 160.16 million shares, against 161.80 million in the previous session. Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market, totaled 194.08 million shares. In the last few days a debate has heated up on Wall Street over whether stocks are due for a pullback after their sharp runup to record highs this summer. The optimists argue that the market's rise has not yet produced the excesses of speculation and exuberance that typically occur when prices are peaking out. But talk persists of an impending `` correction'' as traders seek to cash in profits built up over the first eight months of the year. Brokers say stocks have also been weighed down by doubts that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> will take any further steps in the near future to relax its credit policy. <ORGANIZATION> Allergan </ORGANIZATION> led the active list, down 3 -RCB- at 20 -RCB- on volume of more than 3.16 million shares. The company said its sales this year would n't grow as much as it previously projected. <PERSON> Tiffany </PERSON> jumped 6 -LRB- to 60 -RRB-. Financier <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> received regulatory clearance to invest in the stock. Airline stocks were weak for the second straight session as traders continued to cash in the issues' dramatic gains of late. AMR fell 4 -RRB- to 82 |; <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> 5 -LRB- to 281 -RCB-, and <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> 4 \ to Losers among the blue-chip industrials included <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION>, down 2 at 164 \; <ORGANIZATION> Procter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gamble </ORGANIZATION>, down 1 \ at 124 -RCB-; <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION>, down -LCB- at 116 \, and <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION>, down | Applied Biosystems tumbled 3 -RCB- to 24 -RCB- in the over-the-counter market. The company said its earnings for the quarter ending Sept. 30 would fall short of their level in the comparable period a year ago. As measured by <ORGANIZATION> Wilshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>' index of more than 5,000 actively traded stocks, the market lost $ 6.06 billion, or 0.18 percent, in value. The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>'s composite index of all its listed common stocks slipped .40 to 193.78. <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's industrial index fell .95 to 399.21, and <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; P's 500-stock composite index was down .89 at 348.35 The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market rose .43 to 469.68. At the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the market value index closed at 383.19, up .32.

 Investor <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> has received government clearance to purchase more than $ 15 million of the jewelry firm <ORGANIZATION> Tiffany </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s stock, a <ORGANIZATION> Trump </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman said Thursday. `` Mr. <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> thinks that <PERSON> Tiffany </PERSON> is a very exciting company that represents a good investment opportunity,'' said <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Heilbron </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> Trump </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. She declined to disclose whether <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> already owns any <ORGANIZATION> Tiffany </ORGANIZATION> shares or how large a stake he contemplates acquiring. <PERSON> Tiffany </PERSON> issued a brief news release in which Chairman <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Chaney </PERSON> said <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> had advised him that a filing was made to the government so that <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> might acquire and hold more than $ 15 million of <ORGANIZATION> Tiffany </ORGANIZATION>'s stock `` as an investment and not as part of a takeover effort.'' <PERSON> Tiffany </PERSON>'s stock recently has gone up amid takeover speculation and talk on Wall Street that the stock was being accumulated. Responding to the rumors, <PERSON> Tiffany </PERSON> released a statement on Aug. 25 saying it had n't received any takeover offers and was n't seeking any. <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>, whose holdings include hotels, casinos and an airline, had n't been mentioned as a potential <PERSON> Tiffany </PERSON> suitor. He has n't made any filings to the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> involving <ORGANIZATION> Tiffany </ORGANIZATION>, which would be required if he owned 5 percent or more of the company's stock. <PERSON> Tiffany </PERSON> stock rallied on news of <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>'s interest. It closed at $ 60.37 -LCB-, up $ 6.12 -LCB- a share in composite <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> trading. New York-based <ORGANIZATION> Tiffany </ORGANIZATION>, which owns tony jewelry stores in numerous cities and a flagship store on Fifth Avenue adjacent to the Trump Tower building, was founded in 1837 by <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> <PERSON> Tiffany </PERSON>. It was acquired by cosmetics company <ORGANIZATION> Avon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in 1979, by which time <PERSON> Tiffany </PERSON> had become a public company traded over the counter. <PERSON> Tiffany </PERSON>'s management took the company private in 1984 in a buyout from <LOCATION> Avon </LOCATION> for $ 135.5 million. In May 1987, <PERSON> Tiffany </PERSON> made an initial public offering on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> at $ 23 a share. For the first half of <ORGANIZATION> Tiffany </ORGANIZATION>'s 1989 financial year, which ended July 31, the company earned $ 9.8 million, or 63 cents a share, up 44 percent from $ 6.8 million, or 44 cents a share, a year earlier. Sales in 1989's first half rose 35 percent to $ 159 million from $ 117.9 million. <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> obtained the clearance under the Hart-Scott-Rodino Act which generally requires advance notification of stock or asset acquisitions if a purchase would result in an acquirer holding 15 percent or more of the voting stock of a company or more than $ 15 million worth of a company's voting stock. A <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> spokesman Thursday confirmed that the agency granted <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> early termination of the legal waiting period specified in the act. The waiting period is 15 days from when notification documents are submitted to the government for purchases taking the form of cash tender offers and 30 days for other types of investments.

<HEAD>Oil Markets Maintain Upward Momentum But Rally Loses Some Energy</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Oil futures finished with small to moderate gains Thursday as the recent rally in the energy markets appeared to weaken. Wholesale gasoline prices, which spurted Wednesday on reports of refinery fires, maintained much of their upward momentum, helped by a bullish weekly report on stocks. But prices of crude oil and wholesale home heating oil ran into resistance. On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the contract for October delivery of unleaded gasoline rose 0.52 cent to 55.63 cents a gallon, adding to Wednesday's gain of 1.35 cents. The November, December and January contracts also moved up. Among other refined petroleum products traded on the exchange, the October contract of No. 2 heating oil edged 0.02 cent higher to 55.50 cents a gallon, stabilizing after Wednesday's jump of 0.91 cent Contracts for more distant months ended with minor gains. The October contract for West Texas Intermediate, the benchmark grade of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude oil, settled at $ 19.41 per 42-gallon barrel, up 13 cents from Wednesday when the contract settled with an increase of 23 cents. Other delivery months closed with small losses and gains. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Kane </PERSON>, a vice president of energy futures trading at <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said activity in the energy pits retained a positive tone even though some futures faltered. `` The market seemed to stall in crude but continued strong for gasoline,'' said <PERSON> Kane </PERSON>. `` On the day, we saw a very good consolidation period.'' Prices for gasoline recently have benefited from concerns about possible tightening in supplies temporarily. On Wednesday, a fire at <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION> refinery and one at <ORGANIZATION> Ashland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s refinery in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paul </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION> added to the speculation. After the close of business Wednesday, the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> issued its weekly inventory statistics that were viewed as bullish for gasoline. The API reported a 5.8 million-barrel drawdown in gasoline stocks and a 1.5 million-barrel drawdown in crude stocks. The drop in gasoline inventories was larger than the market had expected while the crude figure was in line with projections.

<TEXT>
 An experimental vaccine for a venereal disease that kills unborn calves appears to be controlling the illness that causes an estimated $ 500 million in losses annually nationwide, a researcher said Thursday. `` Within the next two or three months we'll begin to get a much better idea of just how efficient this product is,'' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Kvasnicka </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> Extension Veterinarian. `` But at this point, everything points toward the fact that this is going to be an extremely good vaccine for use in the field. `` We see it as a major breakthrough to controlling this disease.'' The vaccine for the sexually transmitted trichomoniasis is now available in 41 states under conditional license from the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION>. Researchers estimate the vaccine reduces the incidence of trichomoniasis by more than 90 percent. <PERSON> Kvasnicka </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>, a microbiologist at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nevada </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanks </PERSON>, department chair at <ORGANIZATION> UNR </ORGANIZATION>'s Veterinary Medicine Department, began developing the vaccine a few years ago `` <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>'s cattlemen asked us to develop something because so many cattle were infected with this disease,'' said <PERSON> Kvasnicka </PERSON>, citing statistics that 44.1 percent of <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> cattle tested positive for the disease in 1987. Adult cows do n't show symptoms of the disease when infected with trichomoniasis that's spread during breeding. But cows with the illness can become infertile, abort or their fetuses die, <PERSON> Kvasnicka </PERSON> said. Vaccinated cows tested so far in <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> are `` clearing'' the trichomoniasis disease within weeks and there appears to be no embryonic damages, <PERSON> Kvasnicka </PERSON> said. `` It's really amazing,'' he said. `` But we're still measuring the impact on whether we can save the embryos.'' Researchers are scheduled next week to check on a couple of <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> cattle herds that have been vaccinated to determine whether the disease has killed any unborn calves. `` A key test will come in October when we test the cattle after 120 days of pregnancy,'' he said. `` But we're pretty optimistic because the disease appears to have the biggest effect in the 30 to 60 day period of pregnancy.'' Cows have a 282-day gestation period. An acutely infected herd can lose up to 40 percent of its calves while one that has been carrying the disease for years can lose as many as 10 percent of its unborn calves, <PERSON> Kvasnicka </PERSON> said. If the vaccine is proven safe, <PERSON> Kvasnicka </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> is planning by Jan. 1 to decide whether to fully license the product that was refined by <ORGANIZATION> Fort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dodge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION>. In the early 1980s, researchers in <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> studied the disease, developing a vaccine for bulls. But <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> said that did n't stop the disease. `` The problem with that approach is that if one bull in a herd fails to develop immunity and becomes infected, he passes the disease to every heifer he breeds,'' he explained. `` That is not a good way to go. We need to protect the whole herd.''

 Traders carried the dollar to the highest levels in nearly three months on Thursday, although selling by central banks knocked the currency off its peak of the day. Central banks in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> confirmed they sold dollars to restrain the currency, and traders said the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canada </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> joined in the concerted action. The bankers are committed to keeping exchange rates stable to avoid damage to world trade. At its peak in late European trading the dollar went above 1.99 West German marks, just shy of the psychologically important level of 2 marks to the dollar. It ended the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> trading day below 1.98 marks. Propelling the dollar upward have been attractive <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interest rates and confidence in the health of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy and financial markets. The dollar is near its levels of mid-June, when a rally carried it to two-year highs. The volume of trading was not especially heavy, reflecting traders' uncertainty about the strength of the current rally, said <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Raphael </PERSON>, an assistant vice president at <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brussels </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. In the absence of heavy buying demand, central banks were able to get some results from a relatively modest amount of dollar-selling. Still, many traders expected the market to keep testing the central banks' resolve. `` There's fundamentally no reason for the dollar to come off,'' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Doyle </PERSON>, a corporate foreign exchange trader at the <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Shanghai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> branch in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, the dollar closed at 146.87 yen, up 0.22 yen from Wednesday's close. Later in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> the dollar was quoted at 147.10 yen. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> the dollar traded at 146.65 yen, below its levels of earlier in the day but above its close of 146.10 late Wednesay. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the dollar gained against the British pound. It cost $ 1.5460 to buy one pound, cheaper than $ 1.5552 late Wednesday. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> the pound traded at $ 1.5520, weaker against the dollar than $ 1.5525 on Wednesday. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, compared with late Wednesday's rates, included: 1.9798 West German marks, up from 1.9753; 1.7075 Swiss francs, up from 1.7048; 1.1859 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1802; 6.6685 French francs, up from 6.6560; and 1,419.3 Italian lire, up from 1,417.9. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, compared with late Wednesday's rates, included: 1.9845 West German marks, up from 1.9735; 1.7120 Swiss francs, up from 1.7045; 6.6880 French francs, up from 6.6480; 2.2423 Dutch guilders, up from 2.2280; 1,426.20 Italian lire, up from 1,417.50; and 1.1842 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1798 Gold fell in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to a late bid price of $ 359.50 a troy ounce, compared with late Wednesday's $ 360.25.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Seagram </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> reported Thursday that its second-quarter profit jumped 20 percent from a year earlier, due partly to continued strength in its beverage business The Montreal-based company said net income for the three months ended July 31 rose to $ 198.4 million, or $ 2.07 a share, from $ 165.5 million, or $ 1.74 a share, in the same period in 1988. Revenue totaled $ 1.3 billion, up 5 percent from $ 1.2 billion last year. For the first half of its fiscal year, <ORGANIZATION> Seagram </ORGANIZATION> netted $ 394.9 million, or $ 4.07 a share, on revenue of $ 2.5 billion. That was 20 percent higher than earnings in 1988 of $ 328 billion, or $ 3.45 a share, on $ 2.2 billion in revenue. <ORGANIZATION> Seagram </ORGANIZATION> attributed the increase in earnings to continued strength in its beverage business, which includes distilled spirits, wine and juice, and to favorable results of chemical giant <ORGANIZATION> Du </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, in which it holds a 24 percent stake. Among <ORGANIZATION> Seagram </ORGANIZATION>'s brand-name products are Chivas Regal, <ORGANIZATION> Martell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cognacs </ORGANIZATION>, Mumm and Perrier-Jouet Champagnes, <ORGANIZATION> Seagram </ORGANIZATION>'s Coolers and Tropicana Pure Premium Orange Juice.

<HEAD>Belly Futures Surge On Hopes For Polish Pork Aid</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Futures prices for frozen pork bellies soared the 2-cents-a-pound daily limit Thursday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> on speculation that <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s belly surplus could disappear in a package of food aid to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. On other markets, soybean futures posted strong gains while energy futures and precious metals futures were mixed. Frozen pork belly futures settled 2 cents higher across the board with the contract for delivery in February at 46.82 cents a pound. The rally helped lift livestock futures contracts: live cattle settled .12 cent to .55 cent higher with October at 72.70 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .30 cent to .58 cent higher with October at 82.05 cents a pound; live hogs were .03 cent lower to .40 cent higher with October at 39.75 cents a pound. The February pork-belly contract has risen about 21 percent in value since Aug. 1, when February bellies traded as low as 38.70 cents a pound. Most of the gains have occurred in the past week on hopes that some of the near-record supplies of bellies languishing in deep freeze will be given to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> along with other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> commodities. `` We probably will end up shipping bellies to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Durchholz </PERSON>, a livestock-market analyst with <ORGANIZATION> AgriVisor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bloomington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION> `` The question is how many and when.'' A pork belly is the part of a pig from which bacon is made. The Agriculture Department's last count showed 96.4 million pounds of pork bellies in cold storage as of Aug. 1, the largest supply for that date since the record year of 1971. Analysts say the resulting drop in bacon prices has led to greater consumption and a more rapid movement of bellies out of freezers, so that the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s Sept. 22 cold-storage report is expected to show 55 million to 60 million pounds in cold storage as of Sept. 1. When talk of a Polish pork-belly shipment first surfaced last week, traders were speculating the amount would be about 30 million pounds. On Wednesday, a financial news service reported the Poles were seeking 50,000 metric tons, or more than 110 million pounds each of bellies and beef. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have been cautious in their statements about a possible shipment. On Thursday, <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldthwait </PERSON>, an assistant administrator with the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s foreign agriculture service, said it was premature to talk about quantities or even about what commodities may be included in an aid package. <PERSON> Durchholz </PERSON> said the market may be overreacting, but he conceded the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> belly surplus no longer looked so enormous. `` When I start looking at the numbers being batted around, all of a sudden you're saying that what was an overabundance is not necessarily so,'' he said. Soybean futures prices reached two-week highs on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>, boosted by perceptions of increased foreign demand for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soy products and by a bullish harvest forecast from <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, Tenn.-based <ORGANIZATION> Sparks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commodities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. Sparks pegged the 1989 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soybean crop at 1.85 billion bushels compared with the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s August estimate of 1.91 billion bushels The <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> will revise its crop estimates on Tuesday. If <PERSON> Sparks </PERSON> is right, soybean prices could be headed for an extended stay above $ 6 a bushel, said <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connell </PERSON>, a grain market analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Refco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. Soybeans settled 4 \ cents to 9 \ cents higher with September at $ 5.96 -RCB- a bushel; wheat futures settled 1 cent lower to 1 \ cents higher with September at $ 3.97 a bushel; corn was 1 cent lower to 1 cent higher with September at $ 2.36 -LCB- a bushel; oats were \ cent to 2 cents higher with September at $ 1.36 On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intermediate </ORGANIZATION> crude oil settled 4 cents lower to 13 cents higher with October at $ 19.41 a barrel; heating oil was .11 cent lower to .04 cent higher with October at 55.50 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .10 cent to .54 cent higher with October at 55.63 cents a gallon. On <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, gold futures settled $ 1.40 lower across the board with October at $ 362.30 a troy ounce; silver was 1.3 cents to 1.7 cents higher with September at $ 5.117 a troy ounce.

 Seven large companies will offer at-home emergency child care to more than 13,000 employees in a yearlong experiment in day-care assistance. The employees will qualify for emergency assistance in a variety of situations that typically force parents to stay home from work: when a child becomes ill and can not go to school, when the family's regular child care arrangements fall through, or when a parent is suddenly called away on business An employee will be entitled to use the service up to three consecutive days. `` This is a perfect example of what I have in mind when I write about the concept of the family-friendly workplace,'' <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Zigler </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> professor and a longtime advocate of a national child care policy, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> in a story published Thursday. The seven companies, all in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, are Home Box Office, <ORGANIZATION> Colgate-Palmolive </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Westminster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Magazine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the accounting firm <ORGANIZATION> Ernst </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, the electric utility <ORGANIZATION> Consolidated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Edison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Skadden </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arps </LOCATION>, Slate, <PERSON> Meagher </PERSON>, & amp; <ORGANIZATION> Flom </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s largest law firm A mixture of bottom-line profit considerations and concern for employees spurred companies to create the program, officials said. `` We no longer live in communities where there are extended families, or where we even know our neighbors, so parents have no backup systems,'' said <PERSON> Karol </PERSON> <PERSON> Rose </PERSON>, manager of the Work and Family Program at Time. `` When an employee does n't come to work, or leaves a child in a situation he worries about, it is stressful for the employee and costly for the employer.'' Five participating companies will pay the full cost of the care, about $ 10.50 an hour, and the others will pay most of the cost, with employees covering the balance. Some companies expect the program to cut costs because of the high cost of temporary workers. For example, <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Box </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> pays $ 15 to $ 20 an hour to hire a temporary word processor, said <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Platt </PERSON>, a company spokeswoman.

 Chemical giant <ORGANIZATION> Du </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nemours </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> has been ordered to stop selling two fungicides which were contaminated with an herbicide during manufacture, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> announced Thursday. The two fungicides, Benlate and <PERSON> Tersan </PERSON>, were contaminated with atrazine during manufacture by a subcontractor, <ORGANIZATION> Terra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemicals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Blythe </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Ark. </LOCATION>, said spokesman <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentley </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>'s office Use of the tainted fungicides poses potential risks of plant injury and illegal residue on food crops, the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> reported. Benlate is registered for use on ornamental plants and certain food crops, while <PERSON> Tersan </PERSON> is registered for turf and ornamental uses. <PERSON> Bentley </PERSON> said since atrazine is applied early in the growing season, residue from the pesticide is not normally found on crops. Because of that tolerance standards for atrazine residue have not been established by the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>. Benlate, however, is applied later in the growing season and because of that atrazine residue could show up, <PERSON> Bentley </PERSON> said. However, the contamination does not pose a significant health threat, he said. The EPA issues between 1,000 and 2,000 stop-sale orders a year and the move is not considered unusual, <PERSON> Bentley </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Waltz </PERSON> said most of the product has already been sold and the company initiated a voluntary recall last month. The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> issued the stop-sale order after receiving numerous complaints of plant injury nationwide, <PERSON> Bentley </PERSON> said. Because atrazine is an herbicide, the contaminated Benlate was killing some of the plants it was applied on.

<HEAD>Money Supply Down</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The two broadest measures of the nation's money supply fell in the week ended Aug. 28, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> reported Thursday. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> said the measure known as M2 fell to a seasonally adjusted $ 3,137.3 billion from $ 3,138.4 billion the previous week. An even broader measure, M3, fell to a seasonally adjusted $ 4,005.4 billion from $ 4,010.4 billion. The narrowest measure of the money supply, M1, fell to a seasonally adjusted $ 777.2 billion from $ 779.6 billion. M1 includes cash in circulation, deposits in checking accounts and non-bank travelers checks. M2 is M1 plus accounts like savings deposits and money-market mutual funds. M3 is M2 plus less-liquid accounts, such as certificates of deposit in minimum denominations of $ 100,000. In judging its monetary policy, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> has indicated it is monitoring the value of the dollar, commodity prices and the difference between short - and long-term interest rates It also has shifted its attention from M1 to the two broader money supply measures. The annual growth rate in M2 so far this year is 3.3 percent, which is within the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s target range of 3 percent to 7 percent. The annual growth rate in M3 is 3.6 percent, which is within the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s target range of 3.5 percent to 7.5 percent. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> has not set a target for M1 growth since early 1987. For the latest 13 weeks, M2 averaged $ 3,112.2 billion, a 4.6 percent seasonally adjusted annual rate of gain from the previous 13 weeks. M3 averaged $ 3,994.4 billion, up 4.1 percent, while M1 fell 3.0 percent to an average of $ 775.2 billion. In other reports: _ The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> reported commercial and industrial loans at major <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> banks fell $ 3.03 billion _ The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> said bank borrowings from the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION> at the discount window, excluding extended credit, averaged $ 492 million a day in the week ended Wednesday, down from $ 540 million the previous week _ The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> said net free reserves averaged $ 535 million in the two weeks ended Wednesday, up from from $ 246 million in the previous two-week period _ The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Louis </ORGANIZATION> reported that the monetary base, the seasonally adjusted total of member bank reserves held at <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> banks and cash in bank vaults and in circulation, was $ 291.9 billion in the two-week period ended Aug. 23, up from $ 289.5 billion two weeks earlier

 Citing stock declines and losses exceeding $ 126 million, a <ORGANIZATION> Datapoint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> shareholder said Thursday he is trying to oust takeover specialist <PERSON> Asher </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Edelman </PERSON> as chairman and place his own nominees on the company's board. `` I think the company needs a workout or turnaround philosophy rather than its present philosophy,'' said <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ackerman </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> attorney who tries to revive troubled companies. <PERSON> Ackerman </PERSON> filed papers with the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday stating why he believes <PERSON> Edelman </PERSON> should be removed from <ORGANIZATION> Datapoint </ORGANIZATION>'s board. <PERSON> Ackerman </PERSON> is awaiting <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> clearance to submit a 25-page proposal to <ORGANIZATION> Datapoint </ORGANIZATION>'s estimated 4,500 shareholders seeking their consent. More than 40 percent of the computer company's stock is held by 46 large institutions, he said. `` If the institutions think they've had enough of <PERSON> Edelman </PERSON>, then I'll win,'' said <PERSON> Ackerman </PERSON>, who also is chairman and chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION> Authorized </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Distribution </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey-based </LOCATION> computer sales and service company. The motion should be put to the stockholders within 60 days, he said. <PERSON> Edelman </PERSON> ousted <ORGANIZATION> Datapoint </ORGANIZATION>'s longtime management in March 1985. He used some of <ORGANIZATION> Datapoint </ORGANIZATION>'s liquid capital for investments, mostly in bids to take over other corporations. In the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> filing, <PERSON> Ackerman </PERSON> said a review of public information indicates that <ORGANIZATION> Datapoint </ORGANIZATION>'s stock value has declined about 58 percent since <PERSON> Edelman </PERSON> took over in 1985, a period in which the <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Poors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Composite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Index </ORGANIZATION> increased 81 percent. Also, according to <PERSON> Ackerman </PERSON>, from fiscal year 1985 to 1988 <ORGANIZATION> Datapoint </ORGANIZATION> suffered net losses exceeding $ 106 million, and it had a $ 20.3 million net loss for the nine months ending April 29. He claims <PERSON> Edelman </PERSON> used <ORGANIZATION> Datapoint </ORGANIZATION> money for speculation in the securities of other companies and that <PERSON> Edelman </PERSON> and his associates on the board were paid large fees by <ORGANIZATION> Datapoint </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Edelman </PERSON> did not immediately return a telephone call Thursday seeking comment. By law, <PERSON> Ackerman </PERSON> said, he could only approach up to 10 <ORGANIZATION> Datapoint </ORGANIZATION> stockholder institutions about his plans for the company, and he has contacted eight. `` So far all of them have encouraged us to go forward,'' he said. <PERSON> Ackerman </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Datapoint </ORGANIZATION> stockholder since May, said if he is successful in taking control of the <ORGANIZATION> Datapoint </ORGANIZATION> board, he would immediately halt the company's involvement in investing in the stocks of potential takeover targets. He said <ORGANIZATION> Datapoint </ORGANIZATION> needs to get back into computers and `` out of the raid and trade business.'' <ORGANIZATION> Datapoint </ORGANIZATION> has about $ 330 million in annual sales and employs 2,600 people. It encountered trouble in the early 1980s because of a soft computer market, a fight with stockholders who claimed in a lawsuit the company misled them, and an inability to sell <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION> real estate and lease office space in Datapoint-owned buildings.

President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has nominated White House assistant <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Breeden </PERSON> to succeed him. <PERSON> Goldsmith </PERSON>'s consortium, <ORGANIZATION> Hoylake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investments </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, launched a $ 21 billion takeover bid for BAT, the world's largest tobacco company, in late July. BAT, whose <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> holdings include the <ORGANIZATION> Saks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fifth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Avenue </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Marshall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Field </ORGANIZATION> department stores as well as <ORGANIZATION> Farmers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, has vowed to fight the takeover attempt.

 <ORGANIZATION> Ashland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday it had settled a dispute with the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Iranian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> for $ 325 million, less than a week before a trial was scheduled to begin in <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>. The dispute has been the subject of litigation between <ORGANIZATION> Ashland </ORGANIZATION> and National Iranian since 1980 in courts in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bermuda </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, as well as other proceedings, <ORGANIZATION> Ashland </ORGANIZATION> said. It involved National Iranian's claim for about $ 283 million of unpaid invoices for crude oil shipments to <ORGANIZATION> Ashland </ORGANIZATION> in 1979, plus interest of about $ 285 million, for a total claim of about $ 768 million. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Ashland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION>'s chairman and chief executive officer, said in a statement the settlement was fair and in the best interests of both parties. `` Ashland never disputed receiving the crude oil or that it was obligated to pay a reasonable price for it,'' <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> said in the release. `` Ashland simply wished to recover losses it sustained in 1979 due to breaches of contract by <ORGANIZATION> NIOC </ORGANIZATION>. Considering Ashland had the use and benefit of $ 283 million for almost 10 years, we feel this settlement satisfactorily addresses our counterclaims.'' <ORGANIZATION> Ashland </ORGANIZATION> had counterclaimed in the courts for breaches of contract by National Iranian. A trial regarding National Iranian's claim was scheduled to start in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miss. </LOCATION>, on Sept. 11. No trial date had been set in a case in <LOCATION> Bermuda </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> said the settlement will result in a pre-tax charge of $ 42 million in <ORGANIZATION> Ashland </ORGANIZATION>'s fiscal fourth quarter, ending Sept. 30. <ORGANIZATION> Ashland </ORGANIZATION> is the nation's largest independent oil refiner.

<HEAD>Computer Printer Company Rejects Takeover, Announces Restructuring</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Dataproducts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> spurned a buyout bid from a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> investment firm Thursday and said it would restructure by laying off 400 employees, a fifth of its <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> work force, and selling its headquarters and a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> subsidiary. The computer printer maker said it expected to realize about $ 60 million in cash after completing the sales and paying costs of the restructuring and taxes. It said it would distribute the profit to shareholders as a special dividend worth about $ 3 per share. The regular semi-annual dividend of 8 cents per share will be dropped. The company is facing tough domestic and Japanese competition as well as the takeover proposal by <ORGANIZATION> DPC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Acquisition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION>, a group led by <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Castle </PERSON>, a former chief executive of the Wall Street investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Donaldson </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lufkin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jenrette </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> DPC </ORGANIZATION> owns 8 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Dataproducts </ORGANIZATION>' shares and proposed last month to buy the rest for $ 273 million, or $ 15 a share, with at least $ 10 per share in cash <ORGANIZATION> Dataproducts </ORGANIZATION> said neither that offer, nor another buyout proposal it declined to describe in detail, had adequate financing. It said its board decided restructuring was best for its shareholders after it and its investment bankers, <ORGANIZATION> Goldman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sachs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, discussed selling all or part of its businesses `` with more than 70 entities.'' <ORGANIZATION> Dataproducts </ORGANIZATION> shares fell $ 2.25 Thursday to close at $ 10 on the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. The company said it would save about $ 20 million a year through the layoffs. It said it intended to sell <LOCATION> Wallingford </LOCATION>, Conn.-based <ORGANIZATION> Dataproducts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION>, which makes heavy-duty computer printers and communications equipment for the military. <ORGANIZATION> DPC </ORGANIZATION> last month offered to buy the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> operation in exchange for $ 25 million cash and its existing stake in <ORGANIZATION> Dataproducts </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Dataproducts </ORGANIZATION> said it agreed in principle to sell its 21-acre headquarters property to <ORGANIZATION> Trizec </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Properties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> for $ 63 million.

<TEXT>
 A federal appeals panel Thursday upheld <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in an antitrust lawsuit filed by three companies that buy and resell replacement parts for Chrysler-produced vehicles. A three-judge panel of the 6th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> upheld a ruling by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> DeMascio </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> in favor of <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Logistics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Aargus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Truck </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Automotive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supply </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Guardian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supply </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> sued <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>, alleging the automaker illegally conspired to restrain trade. The companies also alleged that <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> attempted to monopolize the resale of Chrysler-produced auto parts to Chrysler-franchised dealers and to the government. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> argued that it and about 2,400 independent manufacturers or suppliers of compatible replacement parts compete for the replacement parts market. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> also argued that the plaintiffs failed to prove their monopoly allegations because <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s share of the replacement-parts market was only about 20 percent. DeMascio, presiding at a trial of the lawsuit, issued rulings in February and May 1988 in favor of <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>. The three plaintiff companies appealed. The companies buy and resell Chrysler-produced and compatible replacement parts for <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> vehicles. Businessman <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> Henke </PERSON> owns and operates the three companies through stock ownership.

<HEAD>Dollar Up, Share Prices Gain</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: New throughout to UPDATE with morning Nikkei, comments.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar was slightly lower against the Japanese yen during morning trading Friday, while share prices on the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> gained moderately. The dollar closed the morning trading session at 146.55 yen, down 0.32 yen from Thursday's close of 146.87 yen. After opening lower at 146.59 yen, the currency ranged from 146.40 to 146.90 yen. The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which lost 118.75 points the previous day, gained 72.03 points, or 0.21 percent, to close the morning session at 34,224.59. Currency dealers said there were strong dollar-buying incentives following Thursday's decision by <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s central bank to leave that nation's interest rates unchanged. A dealer with a major commercial bank in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, who spoke anonymously, said the dollar edged up from the opening with some early buying, but profit-taking quickly eased its upward path. On the stock market, the <ORGANIZATION> Nikkei </ORGANIZATION> index moved higher as investors welcomed the yen's reversal against the dollar, dealers said. But a dealer at <ORGANIZATION> Nikko </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, speaking anonymously, said, `` We still need to determine whether the yen-dollar rate has really stabilized or is just easing temporarily.''
