 A 74-year-old woman was convicted of killing another woman by trying to exorcise the devil from her and was sentenced to six years in a psychiatric institution. The Constance regional court convicted <PERSON> Magdalena </PERSON> <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohler </PERSON> on Thursday of causing the death of a 66-year-old widow over five years of exorcism rites. Mrs. <PERSON> Kohler </PERSON> told the court she believed the victim was possessed by the devil. <PERSON> Anna </PERSON> <PERSON> Wermuthaeuser </PERSON>'s bruised body was found at Mrs. <PERSON> Kohler </PERSON>'s home in February. An autopsy revealed she had been beaten for years. Mrs. <PERSON> Kohler </PERSON> admitted during testimony that she had locked the victim in her room, saying Mrs. <PERSON> Wermuthaeuser </PERSON> had `` gone crazy'' and that the devil had spoken through her. She denied beating the victim. Mrs. <PERSON> Kohler </PERSON> was convicted in <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION> in 1969 and sentenced to 10 years in prison in connection with another exorcism rite that claimed the life of a teen-age girl.

<HEAD>Bottle of Wine Sells For $30,000</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A 177-year-old bottle of French wine sold for $ 30,525. `` The buyer has n't told me what he's going to do with it, but if he has any sense he will probably drink it,'' said <PERSON> Christie </PERSON>'s auctioneer <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Broadbent </PERSON> The buyer at Thursday's auction was a Swiss bidding by telephone who did not want his name published. The seller was <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerlach </PERSON> <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Vedbaek </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>. The wine in an old green bottle was a Sauterne dated 1811 from the Chateau Yquem vineyards south of <LOCATION> Bordeaux </LOCATION>. `` We expected to get over 10,000 pounds -LRB- $ 18,500 -RRB- for it,'' said <PERSON> Broadbent </PERSON>. `` The 1811 vintage was highly successful in every European wine district and as there was a comet that year, it is known as the comet vintage. It is as celebrated as the vintages of 1784 and 1847, and arguably is the most renowned of all time,'' the auctioneer said. <PERSON> Broadbent </PERSON> said <PERSON> Christie </PERSON>'s had not sold a similar bottle but that he had tasted one two years ago. `` It had a lovely color with a warm glow and a raisiny bouquet, full of flavor and life _ a beautiful drink and a rare experience,'' the auctioneer said. The record price paid for a bottle of wine is 105,000 pounds, then about $ 150,000, for a 1787 Chateau Lafite red, sold Dec. 5, 1985. The bottle had been initialed for dispatch to <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON>, but it was never delivered.

 Acting on an optimistic weather report, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> decided to try again Friday to send <LOCATION> Atlantis </LOCATION> on the secret military mission that was scrubbed Thursday because of violently shifting 104 mph winds in the shuttle's flight path. Officials were briefed by weather experts late Thursday and shortly before midnight workers began refueling the spacecraft for a launch Friday during a three-hour period beginning at 6:32 a.m. EST. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said the launch management team was `` very upbeat'' about prospects for Friday because the weather system that postponed liftoff Thursday `` has left the area.'' `` The upper winds are essentially more benign than they were today,'' <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said. He added that surface winds were expected to be an acceptable 10 knots out of the north at the opening of the window but would `` tend to become more marginal at the end of the period.'' Earlier, <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> weathermen had said there was a 70 percent chance that winds would not interfere again if Atlantis could be launched soon after sunrise. Should Friday's launch have to be scrubbed, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> would have to wait until Sunday to try again. The space agency's policy prohibits putting work crews through the hectic launch schedule three days in a row. <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Cmdr. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON> and his four-man military crew, dressed in uncomfortable, bulky escapet suits, had been lying on their backs in cabin seats for nearly five hours Thursday when the decision was made to scrub. `` They took it in stride, so did the rest of the team,'' said launch director <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Sieck </PERSON>. `` We've been talking about the threat of this ... so it came as no surprise.'' The astronauts themselves were not heard from publicly because <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>, operating under strict <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> secrecy requirements, did not carry the usual shuttle-to-launch control conversations over its radio circuit. Using all the resources at its command _ high-altitude weather balloons, radar, and a shuttle pilot flying through the clouds _ <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> continuously sampled the weather before finally calling it quits. `` We were watching the weather all the way and finally scrubbed due to the winds aloft,'' <PERSON> Sieck </PERSON> said. `` There was no hope we were going to get out of the situation.'' Rain had left the area and skies had begun clearing, but eight miles above the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> winds exceeded hurricane force. <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> engineer, said the blasts were so powerful and erratic that the shuttle's computer could not be programmed to safely adjust its flight path. Such winds could cause serious damage to the shuttle's wings. Col. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Madura </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> weatherman, said the storm front that caused the problems would be offshore Friday but could be followed by strong ground winds that might affect a launch. Sources said the countdown, blacked out publicly for security reasons, had been held twice for one-hour periods. It was allowed to proceed to the nine-minute-to-launch mark so that quick advantage could be taken of a break in the weather. None came. After the scrub, technicians immediately started draining the half-million gallons of supercold fuel that feed the shuttle's three main engines. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s practice is to go through the loading and unloading cycle only twice in a 48-hour period, then calling a two-day break to give technicians a rest. So if weather interfered again with a fueled shuttle on Friday, the liftoff would be delayed at least until Sunday. The scrub extended <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON>'s unenviable shuttle record for suiting up and getting ready to fly, only to be disappointed. As commander of the 24th space shuttle mission, he had boarded his ship, <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION>, six times before it finally made the flight. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> had known for days that bad weather was expected at this seaside space port Thursday morning, but it gambled on beating the one-in-five odds that weathermen gave for acceptable conditions. The scrub cost of fueling-draining-refueling, of having ships waiting to retrieve the booster rockets and a myriad of other launch activities has been estimated at $ 250,000. Atlantis' mission is only the second since the Challenger explosion on Jan. 28, 1986, that killed seven astronauts. Though neither <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> nor the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> will discuss the caro, sources said the shuttle is to launch a $ 500 million spy satellite called Lacrosse. The sources said the satellite carries a powerful new radar that is able to penetrate clouds and gather images of military targets in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Lacrosse is expected to act as the radar `` eye in the sky'' for the new B-2 stealth bomber.

 Many of the bars, cafes and hotels where <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> lived and plotted his successful invasion of <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> three decades ago are gone, but a few people still remember the bearded revolutionary _ or think they do. <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> lived here for 18 months as an exile, but where he took his meals and hung out are questions that only he, or maybe his younger brother <PERSON> Raul </PERSON>, can say for certain. <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> returned to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> on Wednesday for the first time in 32 years, this time for Thursday's inauguration of <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON>. It was clear he had fond memories as he strode off his plane to a red-carpet welcome and saluted the crowd jovially. `` This is my second homeland, I'm thrilled to be back,'' said <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>, 61. When he first arrived here on July 8, 1955, <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> was an almost penniless young lawyer. His sister, <PERSON> Lidia </PERSON>, had to sell her refrigerator to raise money for the trip from <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> and his brother, <PERSON> Raul </PERSON>, had just spent almost two years in a <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> prison for leading an unsuccessful but now legendary attack on the <PERSON> Moncada </PERSON> barracks in a first effort to overthrow dictator <PERSON> Fulgencio </PERSON> <PERSON> Batista </PERSON>. The brothers quickly set to work organizing a network of Cuban exiles into a secret invading force. They lived as inconspicuously as possible, although the <ORGANIZATION> Cuban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> naval attache did take notice and made several inquiries about them with Mexican authorities. `` They were n't important people and there were a lot of exiles here in those days. So there was no reason for anyone to take much notice of them,'' said a retired military officer who worked in security for a time. He asked to remain anonymous. One of the few who remembers <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> is <PERSON> Filiberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Clemente </PERSON>, the cashier at the Bar Latino, a block from the <ORGANIZATION> Inter-American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. `` They used to sit there,'' <PERSON> Clemente </PERSON>, 52, said in a recent interview, pointing to a corner table. `` I was very young then, a sort of waiter's helper.'' `` <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> _ Fidel, I mean _ used to eat Spanish food. He drank little, cognac sometimes. And also manzanilla, a -LRB- sherry-like -RRB- <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> drink,'' <PERSON> Clemente </PERSON> said. `` He used to live a few blocks from here, at the Hotel Oxford.'' At Hotel Oxford's seedy bar, a white-haired barkeeper in her mid-60s also said she remembered <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>. `` He used to come here often because a lot of Cuban girls were living here at the time. But he did not live here,'' said the woman, who refused to give her name. `` He lived around the corner, at the Hotel Mariscala, which used to be known before as <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Casa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> la </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zorra </ORGANIZATION>,'' she added. The Hotel Mariscala is gone. <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> is supposed to have had breakfast often at the Cafe Habana, around the corner from a gym where the conspirators worked out daily. The Habana still stands on the corner of <LOCATION> Morelos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Avenue </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bucarelli </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION>, but the last owner and the old cook both died recently. At the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> used to chat with other Latin American exiles, among them <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Alberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Monge </PERSON>, the organization's general secretary, and <PERSON> Romulo </PERSON> <PERSON> Betancourt </PERSON> <PERSON> Monge </PERSON> later became as president of <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Betancourt </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>. As his movement grew to about 60 fighters, <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> split them into secret cells of 10 each and moved them to separate safe-houses. Among those <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> enlisted was <PERSON> Alberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Bayo </PERSON>, a Cuban-born officer who fought with the Republican army during the Spanish Civil War. In his memoirs, <PERSON> Bravo </PERSON> wrote the Cubans trained by jogging along <LOCATION> Insurgentes </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Avenue </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s main north-south thoroughfare, and by climbing Iztaccihuatl and <PERSON> Popocatepetl </PERSON>, two volcanoes to the southeast. The Cubans moved to a rundown ranch near <LOCATION> Chalco </LOCATION>, a town 21 miles southeast of the capital, and continued training while disguised as workmen. On June 20, 1956, <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> and two of his men were arrested, and on July 2 police raided the ranch and arrested a dozen fighters. They were released with help from former Mexican President <PERSON> Lazaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON>, a leftist sympathizer and a power in Mexican politics. <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON> was the father of <PERSON> Cuauhtemoc </PERSON> <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON>, the man <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> beat in a disputed election July 6. Many Mexican leftists feel <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> is lending support to an illegitimate government by attending the <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> inauguration. <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> and his men ended up on the <LOCATION> Yucatan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION>, 122 miles from <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, where they bought a battered 38-foot yacht, the <PERSON> Granma </PERSON>, from an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> named <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Erickson </PERSON>. The small band of Cubans repaired the boat and set off on a stormy nine-day trip to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and into history on Nov. 16, 1956. A 25-month guerrilla war followed, until <PERSON> Batista </PERSON> fled and <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> seized power on Jan. 1, 1959.

<HEAD>Suburban Philadelphia Residents Say $1,000 Parking Tickets Are A
Crime</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HORSHAM, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Ricci </PERSON> was incredulous when a policeman slapped his son with a $ 1,000 parking ticket for illegal parking in front of the family home. `` I flipped,'' <PERSON> Ricci </PERSON>, a retired policeman himself, said recently. But neither he nor others ticketed under a new ordinance are getting sympathy from officials in this suburban <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> township, where an ordinance passed Sept. 13 specifies the fine _ and court costs of $ 23 _ in an effort to keep narrow cul-de-sacs clear for emergency vehicles. `` If a fire engine can not get in there because of the way cars are parked, there is a danger to the lives of the people,'' said township Solicitor <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Del </PERSON> <PERSON> Ricci </PERSON>. `` When you consider the value of human life, I do n't think $ 1,000 is unreasonable.'' <PERSON> Ricci </PERSON>'s 25-year-old son, <PERSON> Ken </PERSON>, was tightening battery cables under the hood when an officer approached him Nov. 22. Moments later, he was showing his father the citation. The elder <PERSON> Ricci </PERSON>, who retired to <ORGANIZATION> Horsham </ORGANIZATION> from <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> `` because I wanted peace and tranquility,'' has company in his disbelief. `` We were astounded,'' said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Cowgill </PERSON>, an insurance agent who was ticketed that same night when he and his wife, <PERSON> Betty </PERSON>, were visiting their grandchildren. `` I thought it was ridiculous, but talk to my wife and you'll hear a different story They were scraping her off the wall.'' At least 11 car owners have received thousand-dollar tickets so far. <PERSON> Del </PERSON> <PERSON> Ricci </PERSON> said judges have discretion to suspend part of the fine. But District Justice <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Price </PERSON>, who expects to be hearing the cases, said the way the ordinance was written requires him to assess the full $ 1,000. The first court hearings are scheduled for the end of December, but Price said he expects the <ORGANIZATION> Township </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, which meets Tuesday, to change the ordinance and give him some flexibility. `` I hope this comes out as funny as it seems,'' said <PERSON> Cowgill </PERSON>, `` because I'm not going to pay that $ 1,000. You might have to visit me in jail at Christmas.''

 Former President <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> <PERSON> Doo-hwan </PERSON> spends his days in exile in an isolated Buddhist temple living the way his ancestors might have _ sleeping on a mat, reading by candlelight, chopping wood for heat and praying. While many Koreans are riveted by televised parliamentary hearings probing corruption and human rights abuses under his presidency, <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> passes his days in the timeless pattern of <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> monks, sharing a solitude that is centuries old. In the isolated 14th century temple <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> and his wife sought as refuge, there is no television, no telephone, and the toilet is a temporary latrine set up outside his room. `` I made a great mistake,'' <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> was quoted as telling monks at Paektam-sa mountain retreat, five hours drive east of <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>. `` I hope that future generations learn a lesson and do not repeat the same mistakes.'' The former president left <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> to go into internal exile Nov. 23 after apologizing to the nation on national television for abuses of power. Dissatisfied dissidents and students have staged mass protests demanding his arrest and return to <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> for punishment. Rural exile is a traditional form of repentance for disgraced Korean officials. President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> Tae-woo hopes <PERSON> Chun </PERSON>'s banishment will persuade Koreans to forgive the former general who took power with military backing in 1980. <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> has denied any personal wrongdoing, but took moral responsibility for widespread corruption and abuses under his tough rule. Many Koreans detest the man who ruled with an iron fist for more than seven years. The temple is in a northeast region called Sorak, or `` Snow Hills,'' a tourist idyll of picturesque mountains, forests, waterfalls and deep ravines. There, temples such as Paektam-sa have sheltered many political refugees in <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s turbulent 5,000-year history. Makeshift guard posts for <PERSON> Chun </PERSON>'s bodyguards and about 200 security police dot the perimeter of the grounds. Police increased security after several dozen radical students tried to storm the gate. Head monk <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Do-kong </PERSON> said he did not know the former president was coming until a few hours before his arrival. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> said he has been told his guests want to avoid contact with outsiders, and with few exceptions they have. <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> and his wife talked with reporters the day they arrived, but since have kept to themselves and have not left the temple grounds. A daughter, her husband and several friends have visited. Korean reporters say visitors usually arrive with faces covered to hide their identity. Meals, cooked by the monks, are vegetarian dishes such as boiled rice, soybean soup, sesame leaves and the spicy, pickled Korean cabbage called kimchi. Reading is by candlelight. <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> reportedly has at least 15 books in his room including some on Buddhism and one called `` Leadership and Politics in <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>.'' He was seen in fur cap and parka chopping wood for fuel. Temperatures in the mountains have been below freezing and heavy snowfalls in January and February usually cut off Paektam-sa. Monks at the temple rise before dawn and say 4:30 a.m. prayers, kneeling before a statue of <PERSON> Buddha </PERSON>. They say <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Soon-ja </PERSON>, have joined them. The monks say <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> told them he sleeps `` peacefully, without insomnia'' and appreciates the time to walk in the wooded grounds. Reporters given a tour of the Chun quarters said the bare 71-square-feet room is a traditional temple accommodation for guests with a small mahogany table and Korean floor bedding. Two black leather cushions and a small vinyl dresser were added specially for the Chuns. Three white towels and a set of winter underwear hung from a string on the wall, the <ORGANIZATION> Korea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> said, and some cosmetics were on the dresser. While <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> stays in rural isolation, a major drive is underway in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> to expunge him from the nation's life and even its history books. In the last week, <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> has resigned formally from the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Democatic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> which he founded in 1981. And the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> announced his photographs and some material lauding achievements of his government would be deleted from school textbooks.

<HEAD>US Orders American Soldiers Out Of UN Group In Lebanon</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has ordered all American military officers out of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> unit that patrols southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, saying the risk to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soldiers has risen too high despite their affiliation with the international peacekeeping group. The decision, disclosed Thursday by senior administration officials who asked not to be named, was attributed to a recent internal review that concluded the risk to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soldiers had `` simply grown too great.'' `` The situation inside <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> is not improving and wearing a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> badge does n't mean anything,'' said one source. The administration's decision affects a unit known as the Observer Group Lebanon of the U.N. Truce Supervision Organization, or <ORGANIZATION> UNTSO </ORGANIZATION>. It was not immediately clear Thursday whether any single recent development in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> had prompted the withdrawal order. Two officials insisted not, saying the order stemmed from `` a comprehensive review of the situation that was just completed.'' Nine months ago, a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> officer assigned to the group was kidnapped. Marine Lt. Col. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, at the time the senior American officer assigned to the group, disappeared last Feb. 17 while driving on a coastal road between the <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> city of Tyre and the border town of <LOCATION> Naqoura </LOCATION>. He became the ninth American to be seized as a hostage in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, all apparently by pro-Iranian Moslem fundamentalists. The administration sources said Thursday the Americans assigned to <ORGANIZATION> Observer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lebanon </ORGANIZATION> were ordered out over the past week. `` They are no longer in southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>,'' said one source. `` They've been withdrawn over the last several days.'' `` It's too risky,'' said another official. `` The risk to our people is now considered too high and we do n't want them traveling inside <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>.'' <ORGANIZATION> UNTSO </ORGANIZATION> has an authorized strength of 299 military personnel, who are drawn from 17 nations. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> each provide 36 men. Of the 36 Americans assigned to <ORGANIZATION> UNTSO </ORGANIZATION>, 16 have normally been assigned to the Observer Group <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Neither the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> nor the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> would discuss the matter publicly Thursday. The sources said, however, the decision had been coordinated between the two departments and the White House and that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had informed the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> it hoped to resume participation in the Observer Group <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> `` when conditions in southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> permit.'' The administration also made clear it would continue to support all other <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> operations in the region, the sources said. <ORGANIZATION> UNTSO </ORGANIZATION> was organized to observe and maintain the cease-fire ordered by the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> in July 1948 following <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s creation and supervise the general armistice agreements between <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> It serves as the focal point for all <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peacekeeping operations and monitors cease-fire violations along the Israeli borders. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has quietly reduced the number of Americans actually patrolling with the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> unit inside <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> since <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>' kidnapping But the administration had adamantly denied having any plans to withdraw <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> soldiers from the team entirely, stressing the need to demonstrate <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> support for the peacekeeping efforts. A third source noted that under normal rotation procedures, an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> would be expected to assume command of Observer Group <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in January and `` that timetable might have played a role.'' The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, in response to the continuing civil strife in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and the fighting between Christians and Moslems, long ago ordered all American civilians out of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and trimmed the staff of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. Only between 10 and 30 people now are assigned to the embassy, officials say.

 President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> acknowledges his selection of a <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION> secretary has been moving at a slower pace than expected, saying apparent front-runner <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON> `` knows that the process takes a while.''

In the case of Tower, the former <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> senator, there has reportedly been infighting in the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> camp over his appointment. Speculation is that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wants to get his defense team in place before he names Tower. `` We're trying to be prudent and do the proper work required to back up appointments at all levels,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said Thursday. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was asked about the reports that Tower is a paid consultant to several major defense contractors. `` Any time there seems to be stories that may be hurtful to somebody it concerns me no matter who it is,'' he said. `` Senator Tower's a friend of mine but he knows that the process takes a while to go forward.'' _ In other transition news, the name of former <ORGANIZATION> Wyoming </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> has surfaced as a possible secretary of the interior. Environmentalists object to <PERSON> Morton </PERSON>, whom they consider too pro-development. Another possibility is <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Broadbent </PERSON>, director of the <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nev. </LOCATION>, airport and former commissioner of the bureau of reclamation. Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> has also been mentioned, as has <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Milliken </PERSON>. Some conservatives are also pushing <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Teeter </PERSON>, the co-director of the transition office, for the post at interior. <PERSON> Teeter </PERSON> has been offered the position of deputy White House chief of staff, but he has n't accepted it yet. _ <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> is also mentioned for energy secretary, but former <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Henson </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>'s name is heard more often. _ <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Deland </PERSON>, the regional <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> administrator in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, is still the leading candidate. <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> Blake </PERSON>, former agency general counsel, is also a possiblity. _ The <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, a conservative think tank, is pushing former <ORGANIZATION> Transporation </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> to become the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> ambassasdor. She is the wife of Senate Minority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, R-Kan. _ Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, a failed <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> presidential candidate, is reportedly eyeing the job as secretary of Housing and Urban Development Both <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> attended a testimonial dinner for <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> Thursday night. _ Rep. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dornan </PERSON>, a hard-line conservative from <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, has let it be known that he'd like to be the new drug czar in the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration. A new name also surfaced for that post, former baseball commissioner <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON>. <PERSON> Ueberroth </PERSON> was once mentioned for the job at <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>, but that's apparently <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON>'s for the taking.

<HEAD>Witness Says Rent Payments Did Not Substitute For Royalties</HEAD>

 <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON>'s rent for two residences was paid by a publishing company that considered the perennial presidential candidate its `` prime asset,'' according to testimony at his tax fraud trial. <PERSON> Marielle </PERSON> <PERSON> Kronberg </PERSON>, former chief operating officer of the publishing house, told jurors Thursday that she made the payments as an expression of gratitude for the firm's best-selling author _ not as a substitute for taxable royalties. The prosecution contends that the rent payments should have been declared as taxable income, along with household and personal services purchased for <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> by his organizations over the last decade. The political eccentric is charged with conspiring to defraud the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> by failing to declare personal financial assistance as income, and by failing to file income tax returns beginning in 1979. In addition, <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> and six associates are charged with conspiring to defraud people who lent LaRouche organizations some $ 30 million, by intentionally failing to repay the bulk of the money. Two other witnesses told jurors in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday that <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> was waited upon hand-and-foot by employees who cooked for him, his wife and his dogs, bought his clothes, cleaned his house and performed concerts for him. Before the two-week-old trial recessed until Monday, Ms. <PERSON> Kronberg </PERSON> identified a $ 900 rent check for a residence used by <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> in 1980, and a $ 5,100 rent check for an apartment he used in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> the next year. The checks came from the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Benjamin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Franklin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publishing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Kronberg </PERSON> said <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> was not involved in the company's operation. The indictment identifies the firm as a company established `` ostensibly for the purpose of publishing the work of LaRouche'' and members of his political movement. Asked by Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> why she made the rent payments, Ms. <PERSON> Kronberg </PERSON> said, `` Because he was our principal author and in that sense our prime asset.'' `` I did n't think it was in lieu of paying'' royalties to <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON>, she testified, adding that many others also used the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> apartment. Ms. <PERSON> Kronberg </PERSON> said the publishing firm did write checks to <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> totaling $ 6,000 for royalty payments, but said she learned they were never cashed. The indictment says <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> signed a 1980 federal tax return showing $ 7,963 in taxable income, including the $ 6,000 in uncashed royalty checks. But the return was never filed. Another witness, <PERSON> Pam </PERSON> <PERSON> Cowdery </PERSON>, testified that she played the violin and sang at LaRouche's <LOCATION> Leesburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, estate when he and his wife `` just wanted to hear some music.'' The former employee of a LaRouche graphic company also said she cooked for the LaRouches, helped clean the house and even prepared `` very special meals'' of boned chicken breasts for the couple's dogs <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON>'s security chief, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Magraw </PERSON>, testified that <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> carried no money, and said he would buy suits, underwear, tobacco and even haircuts for his balding boss from a `` security'' fund. <PERSON> Magraw </PERSON> testified under a grant of limited immunity from prosecution. On trial with <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON> are his chief fund-raiser <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Wertz </PERSON>; his legal adviser, <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Spannaus </PERSON>; and four fund-raisers: <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Billington </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Small </PERSON>, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenberg </PERSON> and <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubinstein </PERSON>.

 A congressman's son who was running for office in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> while on the payroll of the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>'s delegate to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> says his House job consisted of little more than stuffing envelopes on a part-time basis <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Savage </PERSON>'s job came under scrutiny after The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> reported Tuesday that he claimed residency in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and was running for an <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> seat while on the payroll of Del. <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Fauntroy </PERSON>, the district's non-voting delegate to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Savage, son of Rep. <PERSON> Gus </PERSON> <PERSON> Savage </PERSON>, D-Ill., earned $ 21,398 while on <PERSON> Fauntroy </PERSON>'s payroll between September 1987 and June 1988 In order to run for state representative in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, he had filed a sworn statement declaring that he had lived continuously for two years in the district he sought to represent. House rules, meanwhile, say employees may work only in the member's office or district _ in <PERSON> Fauntroy </PERSON>'s case, the nation's capital When the issue was raised, <PERSON> Fauntroy </PERSON> said <PERSON> Savage </PERSON> worked diligently on behalf of a bill that would have granted statehood to the district. But on Thursday, <PERSON> Savage </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> that he did no work on statehood, and only showed up for work on a part-time basis. `` We did n't call out much -LRB- on statehood issues -RRB-,'' <PERSON> Savage </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>. He said he spent most of his time at work `` putting packages -LRB- of statehood material -RRB- together and getting them out.'' The rest of the time, <PERSON> Savage </PERSON> said, he spent `` working around the Hill,'' occasionally attending a hearing or dropping by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> offices. <PERSON> Fauntroy </PERSON> was not immediately available to comment on the apparent contradiction between his and <PERSON> Savage </PERSON>'s assessment of <PERSON> Savage </PERSON>'s job duties. The latest disagreement followed statements by <PERSON> Savage </PERSON> that he had lobbied congressmen on the statehood effort; <PERSON> Fauntroy </PERSON> had said <PERSON> Savage </PERSON> had been working with grassroots organizers. <PERSON> Fauntroy </PERSON> also said <PERSON> Savage </PERSON> used <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> offices and phones to do his lobbying work, but <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> staffers said Thursday that <PERSON> Savage </PERSON> did not use their offices. City officials active in the statehood movement said they had never met or heard of him. <ORGANIZATION> D.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Clarke </PERSON> and council members <PERSON> Hilda </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> and <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Kane </PERSON>, all three of whom are active on statehood issues, said they did not remember meeting Savage. Others have placed Savage in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> at the time he was on <PERSON> Fauntroy </PERSON>'s payroll and living in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. House rules require employees to regularly report to work in the member's <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> or district offices. <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> election laws require candidates to live continuously for two years in the district they intend to represent. <PERSON> Savage </PERSON> signed an affidavit three months after he went to work for <PERSON> Fauntroy </PERSON> verifying his residency in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> severed the electronic links between two of its computer networks this week after an unknown `` hacker'' gained entry to a contractor's computer, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said. Neither of the computer networks involved handled classified data or information, but the links between the two were `` temporarily severed ... in order to provide a barrier to protect users,'' the department said Thursday. The connections between the Arpanet network, which links academic and corporate computer centers, and the so-called Milnet system, which links thousands of military computers, were severed Monday. The Pentagon said the connection was broken after `` an unidentified hacker penetrated a VAX computer belonging to a defense contractor on the night of Nov. 27-28, 1988.'' `` The hacker used a weakness in the end user's computer software. The ` fix' for this problem has been developed by the vendor and is available electronically to users of the software,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> did not identify the contractor, but a spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> Mitre </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bedford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Marcia </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, said one of the company's computers had been entered.

 At least 42 Jews have been told by Soviet authorities that the barrier to their emigration is being removed, according to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> on Soviet Jewry. The Jews had previously been denied exit permits on grounds of state secrecy. Assistant Secretary of State <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shifter </PERSON> said Thursday he heard of the barrier being lifted from Jewish sources. He said he had no official confirmation from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. The move followed the apparent ending of Soviet jamming of American-financed Russian language broadcasts.

Among the `` refuseniks'' informed of the change was <PERSON> Yuli </PERSON> <PERSON> Kosharovsky </PERSON>, who has been waiting for more than 17 years for permission to go to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. He had been denied a visa for classified work he performed as an electronics engineer until 1968. The Jewish group announced, meanwhile, that 2,334 Soviet Jews had been granted exit permits in November _ the largest monthly total this year. Permits this year total 15,640, making the exodus the biggest since 1980.

 Police said they were investigating whether steel rods found near railway tracks caused a train crash that killed the wives of the <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cuzco </LOCATION> mayors and injured the politicians. A railway car carrying the couples careened off tracks in the Andes and tumbled down a ravine Thursday. Officials of the state railroad company <ORGANIZATION> Enafer </ORGANIZATION> and police said steel rods were found near the derailment site. Police said they were looking into reports someone might have planted the rods to cause an accident during a daylong nationwide strike Thursday. They said the likely target was a passenger train that was behind the tourist train, which was making an unscheduled trip. Mayor <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Cucci </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, and Mayor <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Chacon </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Cuzco </LOCATION>, their wives and six other people were on an outing to the <LOCATION> Inca </LOCATION> citadel of Machu Picchu when the crash occurred Thursday, officials said. Authorities said <PERSON> Anna </PERSON> <PERSON> Cucci </PERSON>, about 60, and <PERSON> Doris </PERSON> <PERSON> Chacon </PERSON>, 58, died in the 3:30 p.m. crash. The suvivors were treated at <LOCATION> Cuzco </LOCATION>'s Regional Hospital. Dr. <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>, hospital director, said <PERSON> Cucci </PERSON>, 66, was suffering from multiple bruises but was in stable condition and appeared to be out of danger. <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> said <PERSON> Chacon </PERSON> was in serious condition with multiple fractures and internal bleeding. <PERSON> Chacon </PERSON> underwent surgery late Thursday, the hospital said. Jersey City Councilman <PERSON> Jaime </PERSON> <PERSON> Vasquez </PERSON>, who was also on board, told reporters he suffered minor injuries. The Cuccis arrived in <LOCATION> Cuzco </LOCATION> on Thursday morning and planned to participate in a sister city celebration honoring <LOCATION> Jersy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cuzco </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Vasquez </PERSON> said. Officials said the conditions of the five other people in the car were not immediately available, but they were not believed to have been seriously injured. The vehicle, a modified version of an 11-passenger bus outfitted for rail travel, crashed about six miles outside <LOCATION> Cuzco </LOCATION>, a tourist area 355 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>, police said. The rail car had left <LOCATION> Cuzco </LOCATION> about 2:45 p.m. on a specially scheduled trip to <LOCATION> Machu </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Picchu </LOCATION>, 60 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Cuzco </LOCATION>. Police said the vehicle derailed and traveled about 30 feet along the tracks before going over a hill and tumbling 250 feet down a ravine. Some passengers apparently were able to escape before the car began rolling. <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> said preliminary indications were that the women died of skull fractures. They said the likely target of possible sabotage was a passenger train that uses the same tracks to carry residents between <LOCATION> Cuzco </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Quillabamba </LOCATION>, 20 miles beyond <LOCATION> Machu </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Picchu </LOCATION>. That passenger train left the <LOCATION> Cuzco </LOCATION> station shortly after the tourist car, officials said. In an effort to paralyze business activity, strikers Thursday blocked a mountain road between the cities with logs and rocks, officials said, adding possible saboteurs might have wanted to completely severe transportation by derailing the passenger train. <PERSON> Machu </PERSON> <PERSON> Picchu </PERSON> is a citadel hidden on a jungle mountaintop. In June 1986, a bomb exploded on a train headed for Machu Picchu. Eight people, including an American, were killed. Guerrillas of the Maoist Shining Path were suspected of planting the bomb.

 Inaugural day protests in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and in the streets of this restive capital marred the beginning of President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON>'s six-year term. <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON>, promising political and economic reforms, said Thursday in his inaugural speech to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that `` my administration will respond to the citizens' demand for respect for -LRB- political -RRB- plurality and effective participation.'' <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON>' July 6 presidential victory, the narrowest in the 59-year history of the governing <ORGANIZATION> Institutional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, or <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION>, has been clouded by allegations the election was fraught with fraud and vote-tampering. Defying heavy deployment of army troops, police and plainclothes security guards, thousands who claim the <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION> deprived <PERSON> Cuauhtemoc </PERSON> <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON> of victory in the election held scattered demonstrations. Unlike previous demonstrations, many protesters carried sharpened sticks. Police used tear gas to break up a demonstration by 1,500 people in Zocalo Plaza outside the National Palace, where <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> went after the inauguration. About 150 people, including some police and soldiers, were injured but none were hospitalized, <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> paramedic <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> said. As <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> spoke, a crowd of several thousand threw rocks at police outside the Legislative Palace. Several demonstrators and policemen were reported injured. One police department employee said there were `` many'' arrests, but police spokesmen refused to give figures. A crowd of 6,000 marched about 1 -LCB- miles cheering <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON>, who defeated <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> in populous <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> but finished second nationally to the president. According to the official tally, <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> won just over 50 percent of the vote, with <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON> getting 31 percent, and <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Clouthier </PERSON> of the conservative <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> a distant third with 17 percent. `` It falls to us to create the conditions so that this government ... leaves the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palace </ORGANIZATION> and that it is occupied by the people,'' <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON> told the crowd. <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON> supporters occupied at least 19 city halls in his home state of <LOCATION> Michoacan </LOCATION> last week to demand the ouster of the <LOCATION> Michoacan </LOCATION> governor and staged protests outside 20 others. Protesters outside the <ORGANIZATION> Legislative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palace </ORGANIZATION> said police removed 200 to 300 people early Thursday and left them outside city limits. <PERSON> Alberta </PERSON> <PERSON> Torres </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanchez </PERSON>, 75, claimed police put her on a bus to <LOCATION> Puebla </LOCATION>, 65 miles southeast of the capital. She said she took another bus back to rejoin demonstrators. Just before <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON>, 40, was sworn in, about 140 congressmen from the four parties making up <ORGANIZATION> Cardenas </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> walked out. `` Only the vote can legitimize him!'' shouted one congressman as the group filed out. The congressional delegation of the conservative <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which has not recognized <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON>' victory but says he can redeem himself by performing well in office, remained through the speech. At the end of his speech, however, the delegation of 40 raised signs telling <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> to `` show with actions your pledge to democracy.'' Under an agreement with the <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION>, leaders of the two opposition blocs were allowed to make televised pre-inaugural speeches critical of <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON>' election in return for a promise not to interrupt the ceremony. `` I take office in a complex hour: between collective hope and the weight of accumulated sacrifices; between the need for building for the future and the pressure for immediate accomplishments,'' <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> said. `` It is a singular moment in our history, heavy with risks but rich in opportunity.'' Six years of austerity under a program <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> designed as budget secretary under <ORGANIZATION> Miguel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> la </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Madrid </ORGANIZATION> cut workers' buying power by more than half. It combined with years of slowly mounting discontent with government corruption and elections where the result was a foregone conclusion _ victory for the <ORGANIZATION> PRI </ORGANIZATION>. To recover the economic initiative, <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> said he had given orders to <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Pedro </PERSON> <PERSON> Aspe </PERSON> to begin negotiating new terms with international banks on its $ 102 billion foreign debt, second highest in the developing world behind <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, who represented the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, applauded <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON>' address. `` Here was a man who loved his country with a passion and has a clear understanding of the opportunities and the problems ahead and is ready to roll up his sleeves and go to work,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said after meeting with <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Police Shoot And Wound Gunman In Central London, Free Hostage</HEAD>

 Police shot and wounded a gunman in the busy theater district today after he grabbed a bystander and held him hostage 2 -LCB- hours, dragging him through streets lined with crowded restaurants and pubs, <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> Yard said. The hostage, who was seized in a scuffle after the gunman apparently tried to mug someone else, was unharmed, police said. They said the gunman was taken to a hospital with a chest wound. His condition was not immediately known. More than 200 police, many carrying rifles, rushed to the <LOCATION> Trafalgar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Martin </LOCATION>'s lane area late Thursday where crowds of theatergoers were either heading home or dining in restaurants. <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Chandler </PERSON>, a radio producer with the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, said she was in a pub and ran to a room upstairs to telephone her office. She found herself sharing the room with two police marksmen. `` I looked out of the window and I could see this skinhead holding a dark-haired man around the neck and shoving a gun near his head. The police were calling out: ` Stop it, give it up.' `` The hostage was in a complete daze and the gunman kept dragging him up and down the street from the Strand to <LOCATION> Chandos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Place </LOCATION> and into <LOCATION> Maiden </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lane </LOCATION> ... `` There were still people from the restaurants wandering about and the police were trying to clear them but they were like helpless chickens because they did n't know where he was going to go next. `` -LRB- Later -RRB- they -LRB- the police -RRB- had the man cornered in the alley and I heard over the police radio an order to engage and saying they should open fire if they had a clear shot. Then I heard the bang and it was all over.'' Neither the gunman nor the hostage was identified. Police trailed the gunman and his hostage through side roads lined with theaters and restaurants as other officers sealed the area, ordering pedestrians and traffic off the streets. An officer with a bullhorn appealed to the gunman to surrender and release his hostage, a <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> Yard statement said. The gunman ignored the plea so the marksman shot him, the statement said. Police said the incident began at about 10.30 p.m. Thursday and ended just after 1 a.m. on <LOCATION> Maiden </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lane </LOCATION>, a narrow road near <LOCATION> Trafalgar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> in central <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Last </PERSON>, manager of Rules restaurant on <LOCATION> Maiden </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lane </LOCATION>, said armed police told the 50 diners and staff there to stay inside with the doors locked and keep away from the windows. Free-lance journalist <PERSON> Edmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>, said, `` We could see a man ... holding what looked like a small caliber revolver at a man lying between his legs.'' The British domestic news agency <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said the gunman was thought to have tried to fire the gun several times but that it misfired each time.

 Shouts from thousands of angry demonstrators drowned out the cheers of the few supporters who greeted <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON> on his presidential inauguration. Even uniformed police and army soldiers outnumbered the handful of citizens who showed up Thursday along the inaugural parade route to welcome President <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON>. The protesters claim <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON>, of the governing <ORGANIZATION> Institutional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, stole the presidency in a July 6 fraud-tainted election from <PERSON> Cuauhtemoc </PERSON> <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON>, leader of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, an organization of four leftist parties. `` We know that in this country an electoral fraud was committed and today an illegitimate presidency has been consummated,'' <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON> told 6,000 people who gathered for the afternoon march, the largest protest of the day. <PERSON> Cardenas </PERSON> urged his supporters to avoid violence and organize to work for fair elections and nationwide democracy. Before dawn, authorities removed protesters from the plaza in front of the Legislative Palace, site of the inauguration, and bussed 200 to 300 of them out of the city, demonstrators said. Most were back within hours for a demonstration at the <LOCATION> Zocalo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s central plaza, where police used tear gas to disperse them again. A police blockade around the legislative chamber failed to prevent angry protesters from throwing rocks at the building during the ceremony. Protesters then gathered at Independence Monument for what was planned as a silent protest, but was marked by drumbeats, catcalls at security forces and shouts of `` Death to <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON>!'' Many marchers carried sticks. Others wore black bows to mourn what they called `` the death of democracy.''

<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An explosion rocked a Syrian-policed west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> neighborhood today during the morning rush hour. At least two people were wounded, police said. A police spokesman said the 8 a.m. bomb was planted under a car only 50 yards from a Syrian army checkpoint in the <LOCATION> Lower </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mossaitbeh </LOCATION> district. The spokesman, who can not be named in line with standing regulations, said the explosion shattered glass in the neighborhood. A witness said a private car evacuated `` two wounded men from the scene.'' Police could not say if the wounded were Syrian soldiers. Syrian troops, according to the witness, `` fired their automatic rifles in the air to make way for the car carrying the wounded men,'' then sealed off the area. The Moslem-run Voice of the Nation radio station, based in west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, said the explosion was caused by `` a small bomb planted under a car parked in an empty lot near the Syrian checkpoint.'' <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, the main powerbroker in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, maintains about 40,000 troops in eastern and northern provinces as well as west and south <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. The explosion may have been part of a campaign to discredit the Syrians as peacekeepers. Scores of such attacks have been reported since the Syrians moved into <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> in 1986 to end militia rule. The blast came after a series of house raids mounted by the Syrians to halt renewed violence between rival Shiite Moslem factions. The pro-Iranian <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or Party of God, and the Syrian-backed Amal, Arabic for hope, fought for six days late last month. By police count, 40 people were killed and 87 wounded in the confrontation.

 <PERSON> Woody </PERSON> <PERSON> Guthrie </PERSON>'s songs rang out in a packed theater at a long-delayed tribute to the composer of `` This Land Is Your Land'' in his hometown, where some still maintain the folk-singing great was no folk hero. About 50 schoolchildren and adult accompanists Thursday sang and played fiddle, guitar, banjo, harmonica and piano in <LOCATION> Okemah </LOCATION>'s 450-seat Crystal Theater as the audience whistled and clapped along `` I sat there with chill bumps and with tears,'' said <PERSON> Guthrie </PERSON>'s 65-year-old sister, <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Jo </PERSON> <PERSON> Edgmon </PERSON>, who represented the <PERSON> Guthrie </PERSON> family His singer son, <PERSON> Arlo </PERSON>, did not attend the tribute just a few blocks from the overgrown lot where the <PERSON> Guthrie </PERSON> family's house once stood. Shows honoring the `` Dust Bowl Balladeer,'' who died in 1967, have been held in such grand auditoriums as Carnegie Hall. But Thursday's was the first in <LOCATION> Okemah </LOCATION> because people like city councilman <PERSON> Bart </PERSON> <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> think <PERSON> Guthrie </PERSON> was more of a subversive than a star. <PERSON> Webb </PERSON>, seething over the first of three tribute performances, said he would ask the council Monday to paint over the `` Home of <PERSON> Woody </PERSON> <PERSON> Guthrie </PERSON>'' sign painted on one of the central <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> town's three water towers facing Interstate 40. The ramshackle house where <PERSON> Guthrie </PERSON>'s family lived before he left <LOCATION> Okemah </LOCATION> at age 17 had been vandalized. Some of the graffiti scrawled on the building called him a communist, a label his family rejects. When the house started falling down, local officials did nothing. Leaders of this community of 3,300 also once opposed a move to proclaim a national Woody Guthrie Day. Mrs. <PERSON> Edgmon </PERSON>, a resident of <LOCATION> Seminole </LOCATION> about 75 miles southwest of here, bristled at any suggestion her brother lacked patriotism, saying he championed the downtrodden and jabbed the well-to-do. `` If you'd read what <PERSON> Woody </PERSON> wrote, you'd know how he felt,'' she said. <PERSON> Guthrie </PERSON>'s `` This Land is Your Land'' has become a patriotic standard, frequently played at political rallies. His songs provided a mournful but optimistic rhythm for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> as it endured the Dust Bowl and the Great Depression. Among the 1,000 songs he wrote from 1932 to 1952 were classics like `` <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>,'' and `` This Train is Bound for Glory.'' The 1976 motion picture `` Bound For Glory'' chronicled his vagabond life. <PERSON> Guthrie </PERSON>, stricken with the degenerative brain disease <LOCATION> Huntington </LOCATION>'s chorea, had indicated he wanted <LOCATION> Okemah </LOCATION> to be his final resting place. The town 72 miles east of <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, is a quiet agricultural town surrounded by cattle-grazing land dotted with oil wells.

 Bride selling is still prevalent in poorer areas of rural <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and more must be done to stop the practice, according to a women's organization quoted in today's official <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION>. The All-China Women's Federation said the selling of young women as brides, common in pre-Communist <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, still takes place in inland provinces such as <LOCATION> Anhui </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sichuan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Yunnan </LOCATION> where economies are less developed and education levels are lower, the <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> Daily reported. It said some farmers have given up their land to go into the business of abducting and selling brides. Some have lured women away from villages with the promise of jobs. In one county of coastal <LOCATION> Shandong </LOCATION> province, more than 3,200 women, including farmers, factory workers and a post-graduate, have been sold in the past few years, the federation was quoted as saying. It said a group of agents in a city in coastal <LOCATION> Jiangsu </LOCATION> province made $ 65,000 selling about 100 brides from October 1987 to January this year. The All-China Women's Federation is a government-supported organization that to some extent acts as an advocate for women's rights

<HEAD>Study Says Calcium Intake, Sex Hormone Production Prevent
Osteoporosis</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Women can help prevent brittle bones in old age by regularly consuming dairy products throughout their lives, but calcium supplements taken after menopause probably wo n't be effective, researchers say. In a study in today's Journal of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, researchers said the key factors in bone density among post-menopausal women were lifelong calcium intake and the naturally occurring hormone estrone. Moderate exercise and calcium supplements taken later in life do not appear to prevent osteoporosis, a frequently debilitating disease most common among women in which the bones become thinner and more brittle, they found. `` Swallowing calcium pills at 50 years of age probably is not going to make your bones thicker,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuller </PERSON>, of the <ORGANIZATION> Epidemiology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Kuller </PERSON>, a co-author of the study involving 174 healthy post-menopausal women over a four-year period, also said, `` There is no evidence that moderate exercise in these women increased their bone density.'' `` The most important message ... is that an adequate calcium intake during childhood, adolescence, post-adolescence and the reproductive years is probably a very important part of good health and will probably help prevent bone fracture and osteoporosis,'' he said. Osteoporosis results in a loss of bone density and can lead to bone fractures and spinal problems like dowager's hump. Some estimates project that by age 70, one-quarter of the women in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> will have suffered a fracture related to the disease. <PERSON> Kuller </PERSON> and his colleagues examined the relationship between bone density and dietary calcium intake, calcium supplement use and blood levels of estrone, the primary sex steroid hormone in women after menopause. Estrone is a component of estrogen, a hormone combination. The study found that estrone was also a key factor in maintaining bone density, a positive relationship that was not affected by `` age, time since menopause and the degree of obesity as well as other potential bone determinants.'' The researchers found that women who reported diets high in calcium throughout their lives showed higher bone density. However, observing little impact from use of calcium supplements after menopause, the researchers concluded: `` In our analysis, the only group in which a protective effect of calcium could be observed was in women who reported both a high milk consumption during periods of growth and development, as well as currently.'' <PERSON> Kuller </PERSON> said the jury is still out on other methods of increasing bone density and reducing fractures, but that estrogen therapy in post-menopausal women `` probably reduces osteoporosis.'' The study `` sounds like a reasonable observation supporting what's either been partly known or widely suspected,'' Dr. <PERSON> Murray </PERSON> <PERSON> Favus </PERSON>, director of the bone program at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Pritzker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION>, said Thursday Several recent studies have shown either no impact or minimal impact of calcium supplements on bone density, and the role of estrone has been shown to be important, he said. `` Most of those in the field now really question whether calcium supplements taken after menopause are useful,'' <PERSON> Favus </PERSON> said.

 More news organizations have protested a <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> demand that they surrender their film of the launch of the space shuttle Atlantis in the event of an accident. Some organizations removed their remote cameras from the area of the launch pad, where the flight of the Atlantis was postponed Thursday for at least 24 hours because of poor weather. Other news organizations accepted the requirement, but under protest. After <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> officers disclosed the new policy Wednesday, The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newsweek </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> magazine </ORGANIZATION> refused to sign the agreement and were denied permission to place remote cameras at the launch site. The AP described the arrangement as `` military censorship.'' Later Wednesday, the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times-Union </ORGANIZATION> withdrew its agreement and its cameras. <ORGANIZATION> Gannett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> did the same Thursday after the launch was postponed. The remote cameras, focused on the base of the launch pad, are 1,500 to 2,500 feet away and are activated by the tremors and sounds of liftoff. Photographers are kept about four miles from the launch pad. The agreement gives the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> the right to review any film of an accident and to keep any it feels would disclose classified information. <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Lt. Col. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Rand </PERSON> said the department needs to ensure that no photos show the classified payload, which might be exposed in an accident. Experts believe the payload to be a spy satellite. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> agreement had not been required for other shuttle missions with military payloads. Rand said it is linked to <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s signed agreement with news groups before the Discovery shuttle launch Sept. 29, the first launch after the Jan. 28, 1986, explosion of the Challenger `` <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> had a written agreement, so we needed something in writing,'' Rand said. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> agreement lets news organizations process their own remote-camera film and give it to investigators only after using what they need. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> eventually would return all film. `` We felt the agreement reached after the Challenger explosion was sufficient. This one did n't sound definitive enough,'' said <PERSON> Foster </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Times-Union </ORGANIZATION> assistant managing editor for graphics. At least a dozen news organizations accepted the agreement. Several said they would leave their cameras at the site while they made formal protests and their lawyers studied the requirement. `` We will formally protest because it is an unreasonable and silly attempt to impose censorship after the launch,'' said <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Terilli </PERSON>, general counsel for The <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION>. `` I thought it was a bad precedent,'' said <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, executive editor of <ORGANIZATION> Gannett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. `` ... The demand that film be confiscated was a clear case of a federal agency making an arbitrary decision restricting First Amendment rights.'' The Gannett cameras were put in place before the news service's executives were aware of the new policy, and were removed at the first opportunity, which was after Thursday's launch was scrubbed, <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> said

 <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> knows it ca n't do anything about the weather at its <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> launch site, but the space agency probably wishes it did n't have to spend so much time talking about it. Winds, clouds or storms have forced changes in liftoff plans for the space shuttle eight times, including Thursday's postponement of the Atlantis launch. Three times, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> landings have been canceled because of weather. Weather played a role in <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s worst moment _ the explosion of Challenger on Jan. 28, 1986, that claimed the lives of seven astronauts. The Kennedy Space Center sits on a marshy island that is captive to the shifting winds, frequent rain and powerful fronts moving in from the north that keep the coastal weather in a turmoil of change. The capricious weather has only a minor effect on conventional aircraft and mattered little in the early days of <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>, when unmanned rockets could easily cut through clouds or strong winds on their way into space. But the shuttle, which goes higher and faster, then returns to <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> as a glider, is more sensitive to the forces of nature. Launch-area winds as low as 20 miles an hour can keep the shuttle on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. High-altitude winds, smashing into the shuttle as it races upward, can be violent enough to destroy the spacecraft. It was the threat of such winds that forced the postponement Thursday. Weather rules regulating the launch of the shuttle fill a thick volume, and it takes a small army of forecasters and observers to monitor the subtle atmospheric changes that can affect the spaceship. Some of the rules are new, created after sub-freezing temperatures are thought to have contributed to the failure of a solid-fuel rocket booster that caused the Challenger accident. Shuttle flights depend not only on the weather in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, but also on conditions thousands of miles away. Since the spacecraft could be forced to land on emergency runways in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, bad weather at those distant sites can force a launch delay. Atlantis commander <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON> twice suffered through a weather delay in his first space command. His 1986 flight on <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> was postponed once because of poor weather in <LOCATION> Moron </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, an emergency landing site, and once because of heavy rains on the launch pad. After he got in orbit, <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON> three times made plans to land in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, and three times was disappointed. He finally ended his <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> flight with a touchdown on the desert lake bed at <ORGANIZATION> Edwards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, where weather is seldom a problem. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> has decided for the immediate future to land all shuttles at <LOCATION> Edwards </LOCATION>.

 A pathologist acquitted of charges he killed his cancer-stricken wife to end her suffering says his first job is putting his life back together, but he does n't know where he'll begin. `` I've got a lot of pieces. It's going to take a lot of work,'' Dr. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosier </PERSON> said Thursday after a jury cleared him of all charges in the Jan. 15, 1986, death of his 43-year-old terminally ill wife, <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON>. After deliberating a little more than three hours in the four-week trial, the <ORGANIZATION> Pinellas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Surrogate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> panel cleared Rosier, 47, of first-degree murder, attempted murder and conspiracy. As the verdict was read, <PERSON> Rosier </PERSON> wept and relatives in the courtroom screamed with joy. If convicted, he could have been sentenced to life in prison. <PERSON> Rosier </PERSON> hugged his children <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON>, 19, and <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON>, 21, who supported him and attended the trial daily. The physician said his family wants him to resume his medical practice, but he's doubtful about that. `` I've dealt with a lot of cancer and death,'' he said. Assistant State Attorney <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Volz </PERSON> said he was disappointed with the verdict, but felt the prosecution handled the case well. `` The jury made a decision based upon the facts,'' said <PERSON> Volz </PERSON>. `` I'm never surprised by what a jury does.'' Defense attorney <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenblatt </PERSON> said the case never should have gone to trial. For the state to charge first-degree murder `` bordered on insanity,'' <PERSON> Rosenblatt </PERSON> said. The state maintained that Rosier obtained sedatives for his wife to commit suicide, then administered morphine when they only left her comatose. Eventually, he manipulated her stepfather and brothers into finishing the job, the state argued. But the defense portrayed <PERSON> Rosier </PERSON> as a loving husband of 22 years who wanted to help his wife fulfill her wish of avoiding a painful end. `` If anything good has come out of this, it is perhaps that people in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> will start to look at the terminally ill and the rights of the terminally ill because of the terrible tragedy that befell <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosier </PERSON> and the rest of our family,'' Rosier said. <PERSON> Derek </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphry </PERSON>, president of the pro-euthanasia <ORGANIZATION> Hemlock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, hailed the verdict and called for a change in laws to allow a painless death to end suffering. The acquittal `` sends a signal ... that jurors are not likely to convict in assisted suicide cases _ otherwise known as euthanasia. It is time to modify the law to permit physicians to help terminal patients who request help with death,'' he said. The prosecution charged that <PERSON> Rosier </PERSON>, pained by his wife's fast-spreading lung cancer, obtained 20 Seconals for her to take and administered morphine injections and suppositories when the sedative failed to work Her stepfather, <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> Delman </PERSON>, testified that he went into her bedroom with his two sons, <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> and <PERSON> Farrell </PERSON>, after she lingered for 12 hours in a coma, and smothered her. The Delmans were key prosecution witnesses who testified under a grant of immunity given before the state knew the extent of their involvement. The charges were brought after Rosier appeared on a TV interview and talked about administering drug overdoses to his wife. <PERSON> Volz </PERSON> said <PERSON> Rosier </PERSON> used the broadcast to try to spark interest in an unpublished book about Mrs. <PERSON> Rosier </PERSON>'s life and death, which he wanted to parlay into a movie.

 Sinhalese militants fired guns and threw bombs at a presidential campaign rally, killing five people and wounding 25, authorities said today. Eleven gunmen staged the attack during a rally Thursday night in suburban <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION> for <PERSON> Ossie </PERSON> <PERSON> Abeygoonsekera </PERSON>, candidate of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>, authorities said. The victims included one of <PERSON> Abeygoonsekera </PERSON>'s bodyguards and <PERSON> Devabandara </PERSON> <PERSON> Senaratne </PERSON>, vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Sri </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lanka </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, one of four parties that form the alliance, officials said It was the second attack in less than a month on a campaign rally for Abeygoonsekera. On Nov. 17, suspected Sinhalese militants threw bombs at another campaign meeting, killing three people and injuring 50. All three candidates in the Dec. 19 presidential election have received death threats from the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, a radical Sinhalese group demanding the government's resignation. But <PERSON> Abeygoonsekera </PERSON> has been the only candidate to criticize the front, which has been blamed for more than 900 political murders in the past 16 months. According to police, six gunmen hijacked a passenger bus and drove to the rally site in <LOCATION> Kadawatte </LOCATION>, about 10 miles north of the capital. Five other gunmen were waiting among the spectators, police said. `` While the extremists opened fire from the bus, the others at the meeting flung five bombs,'' said one police official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. They escaped in the bus and another car, the official said. Sinhalese militants are upset at the government's efforts to end the 5-year-old insurgency by minority Tamils fighting for a separate homeland. They contend a peace accord signed in July 1987 grants too many concessions to the Tamils, who make up 18 percent of the island's 16 million people. The Sinhalese make up 75 percent of the island's population and control the government and the military. Sinhalese militants have been demanding the resignation of President <PERSON> Junius </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jayewardene </PERSON>'s government. <PERSON> Jayewardene </PERSON>, a Sinhalese, is not seeking re-election and has said he will step down and dissolve <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> after his successor is chosen.

<HEAD>Women Who Took Vitamins Showed Reduced Chance Of Birth Defects</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A new study suggesting vitamins taken by women helped prevent certain birth defects in their children needs further scrutiny, doctors say. Medical researchers interviewed more than 3,000 mothers and found that those who took vitamins about the time of conception were less likely to have babies with brain and spine defects than other women. But the researchers are unsure whether to credit the vitamins or some other factor, like diet. Evidence remains too thin to recommend that women planning pregnancies take vitamins to try to ward off birth defects, said Dr. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulinare </PERSON>, who led the study group at the national <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. `` Such a simple solution is almost too good to be true,'' said an editorial accompanying the study in today's Journal of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. `` We need confirmation of this finding from other studies.'' Still, the results are valuable because they are a starting point for further research into vitamins as a guard against defects, like anencephaly and spina bifida, <PERSON> Mulinare </PERSON> said Thursday. Anencephaly, the absence of major parts of the brain, usually is fatal after a few hours. Spina bifida, the incomplete closing of the bony casing around the spinal cord, typically causes mild to severe paralysis of the lower body. The defects are equally common and strike about 3,500 infants each year in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Mulinare </PERSON> said. He and his colleagues looked at data on all babies born with at least one of the defects in the five-county <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> area from 1968 through 1980. The researchers interviewed mothers of 347 babies born with the defects, and 2,829 mothers of defect-free babies chosen randomly for comparison. The mothers were asked if they had taken vitamins at least three times a week during the three months before they became pregnant and at least three months after conception. Fourteen percent of all the mothers reported taking multivitamins or their equivalent during the entire six-month period, and 40 percent reported using no vitamins. The remainder of the mothers either took vitamins only part of the time or could n't recall, the researchers said. `` We found that women who ... reported using multivitamins three months prior to conception and in the first three months after conception had a 50 to 60 percent reduction in risk of having a baby with anencephaly or spina bifida, compared with women who reported not having used any vitamins in that same time period,'' <PERSON> Mulinare </PERSON> said. The researchers made adjustments for differences in the ages of the mothers, their education levels, alcohol use, past unsuccessful pregnancies, spermicide use, smoking habits and chronic illnesses. All of those factors have been linked to differences in birth defect rates in past research. The findings come five years after a British report found multivitamin use by mothers who already had one baby with a birth defect seemed to help prevent similar defects in children, the researchers said. Dr. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> wrote in an editorial accompanying the new study that genetic factors may cause some kinds of spina bifida and that vitamins, even if effective, would be unlikely to prevent all cases.

 West Germans today marked the 50th anniversary of the discovery of nuclear fission with mixed emotions, recalling the breakthrough that led to atomic bombings of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION> nuclear disaster. The main ceremony was held in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hall </ORGANIZATION>, just a few miles from the laboratory where German scientists <PERSON> Otto </PERSON> <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> and <PERSON> Fritz </PERSON> <PERSON> Strassmann </PERSON> conducted their pioneering scientific work in December 1938. Words of homage were paid their work, but speakers also emphasized the troubling consequences of the discovery that splitting the uranium atom can lead to the release of massive amounts of energy. `` The bombs on <LOCATION> Hiroshima </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nagasaki </LOCATION>, more than anything else, have taken away any kind of relaxed attitude toward nuclear fission in today's thinking,'' said <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Staab </PERSON>, president of the Max-Planck scientific research institute. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> atomic bombs dropped Aug. 6, 1945, on <LOCATION> Hiroshima </LOCATION> and three days later on <LOCATION> Nagasaki </LOCATION> killed about 210,000 people and led to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s surrender to end World War II. <PERSON> Staab </PERSON> told about 1,100 guests, `` The euphoria of the 1950s for a peaceful use of nuclear fission for producing energy has given way to a skeptical judgment since Chernobyl.'' The 1986 Chernobyl accident that killed 31 people in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> sent clouds of radioactivity over <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Resistance to nuclear energy remains especially strong among young West Germans, who oppose the stationing of nuclear rockets on their soil. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Eberhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Diepgen </PERSON> said, `` This discovery changed the world like hardly any other one before it.'' `` Today we recall this great scientific deed, without being able to celebrate,'' <PERSON> Diepgen </PERSON> said. He said honor for the achievement must include a recollection of the consequences `` from <LOCATION> Hiroshima </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION>.'' The prestigious <ORGANIZATION> Max-Planck </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, along with four other scientific research organizations, sponsored the ceremony. It was held two weeks before the actual 50th anniversary of the key experiment, which started Dec. 16, 1938. <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> received the 1944 Nobel Prize in chemistry for the discovery at the <ORGANIZATION> Kaiser </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wilhelm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemistry </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> and <PERSON> Strassmann </PERSON> found that bombarding the uranium atom with neutrons leads to its splitting, but at first they did n't understand the full implications of their work. Then from her exile in <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, their Jewish colleague, <PERSON> Lise </PERSON> <PERSON> Meitner </PERSON>, furnished the theoretical basis showing that such a splitting could release huge amounts of energy through chain reactions based on <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Einstein </PERSON>'s theory of relativity. Her partner, <PERSON> Otto </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Frisch </PERSON>, also contributed to the theoretical work. Miss <PERSON> Meitner </PERSON> had been driven into exile by the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> several months before the discovery. The Nazi era cast a shadow over another part of the work. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Speer </PERSON>, a former top aide to <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>, strongly implied that <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> was one of a group of German scientists seeking ways to build an atomic bomb before the Americans beat them to it. <PERSON> Speer </PERSON>, <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s armaments minister and the Third <PERSON> Reich </PERSON>'s top architect, wrote that in 1942 he had heard of `` a group of scientists who were on the track of a weapon which could annihilate whole cities, perhaps throw the island of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> out of the fight.'' He wrote that two months later he visited with scientists in <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> to be briefed on `` atomic research,'' as the Nazi <PERSON> Reich </PERSON> struggled to find a way to win World War II. `` Along with scientists whose names I no longer recall, the subsequent Nobel Prize winners'' including <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> were present, <PERSON> Speer </PERSON> wrote in his memoirs, `` Inside the Third Reich.'' However, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Tagesspiegel </ORGANIZATION> newspaper last week said <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> wrote in his diary of having a clean conscience `` that neither during the discovery nor later did I want to work for the use of uranium fission as a war weapon.'' The newspaper said <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> wrote the passage shortly after the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> dropped the bomb on <LOCATION> Hiroshima </LOCATION>. At the time, <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> and other top German atomic scientists were being detained in a British camp, according to <LOCATION> Tagesspiegel </LOCATION>. On Thursday, scientists and officials of the <ORGANIZATION> Technical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> held a news conference to review the discovery and to outline the opening today of their documentary exhibit. `` The development of nuclear physics and its technology has found interest among the public like no other discovery,'' university vice president <PERSON> Ulrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinmueller </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Steinmueller </PERSON> continued: `` The technology carries implicitly in its use _ both in war and peace _ a threat for mankind. The well-founded worries and fears of people give scientists a challenge to be aware of their responsibilities to society.''

<HEAD>Anti-Apartheid Newspaper Returns After Four-Week Suspension</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The Weekly Mail, a prominent anti-apartheid newspaper, returned to newsstands today after a four-week suspension by the government. `` We're back,'' the newspaper declared on its front page. `` We're still strong And we're ready to carry on fighting.'' Home Affairs Minister <PERSON> Stoffel </PERSON> <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> suspended the Weekly Mail Nov. 1, saying the publication was a `` threat to the safety of the public.'' <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> has shut down three anti-government newspapers this year, but all resumed publishing after suspensions ranging from four to 12 weeks. The Weekly Mail, with a circulation of about 22,000 nationwide, is aimed largely at liberal whites and is considered by many to be <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s best-written newspaper. Since it was established in 1985, the newspaper has been a combative government opponent, known for aggressive reporting and sassy political commentary. `` The Weekly Mail may have offended <PERSON> Stoffel </PERSON> <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>, but it did not break any law,'' the newspaper said in a front-page editorial. `` Our ` crime' was to criticize the government and raise questions about its policies and behavior. We will continue to do this.'' <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> could again suspend the newspaper for up to three months. `` We ca n't deny that the month's suspension has hurt,'' the newspaper said, noting the loss of advertising and sales revenue. `` But the extraordinary level of support we have received makes us confident about our future,'' it added. The edition contained several advertisements purchased by its corporate and political supporters welcoming its return. The Weekly Mail has said that <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>'s complaints focused on the newspaper's coverage of security force actions and reports about banned organizations such as the <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla movement. Today's edition contained an article on blacks who have died while in police custody and a story about recently released prisoner <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Gwala </PERSON>, a long-time <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> member. Other stories focused on whites who have refused to perform compulsory military service and on a black man who was on trial for 3 -LCB- years before being acquitted of treason charges. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>'s powers to suspend newspapers are part of the numerous media restrictions imposed under the country's 29-month-old state of emergency. The regulations restrict reporting on security force actions, many forms of peaceful protest and a wide range of statements the government considers subversive. In another development, the government ordered the anti-apartheid Afrikaans-language newspaper Vrye Weekblad to pay a $ 13,000 deposit for a registration certificate. If the newspaper does not pay, the government could shut it down. The government has not said why it is seeking the amount, believed to be the largest security deposit ever demanded in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. There is no fixed amount required for a registration certificate, and some publications have paid less than $ 45. The government already has complained about articles in the weekly newspaper, which has been publishing for only a few weeks. Under apartheid, the nation's 26 million black majority has no voice in national affairs.

Sand set a tentative trial date of June 1, and scheduled a preliminary hearing for Jan. 3. The Garcias and a lawyer from <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Vallone </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, 41, were indicted last week in an alleged conspiracy to obtain $ 185,000 in cash, interest-free loans and jewelry from <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION>. The indictment came just a few days after former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON>, another <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Democrat </LOCATION>, and four others were sentenced to prison for their conviction in a Wedtech-related racketeering trial. <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> grew from a small machine shop into a multimillion-dollar business through a series of no-bid government contracts obtained through a federal minority business program. Federal and state investigations uncovered a web of corruption involving <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> payoffs extending from the <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The seven-count indictment accused <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> of using his official position to demand and obtain payoffs from <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION>, which was headquartered in his congressional district. <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>, a congressman since 1978, is charged with extortion, conspiracy, bribery and receipt of illegal gratuities. His wife, 48, faces similar charges.

<HEAD>TV Viewing Up Overall, But Network Share Declines</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By KATHRYN BAKER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Television viewing rose slightly during November, but the networks' share of viewership declined as independent stations' and pay cable's share increased compared with the same period a year ago. Independent stations, which have become more aggressive about programming during sweeps periods, racked up a 47 percent increase in ratings for November, compared to the same period last year, according to the <ORGANIZATION> A.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nielsen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Pay cable was up 33 percent The networks rebounded a bit during the month, thanks to <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s miniseries `` War and Remembrance. Overall network viewing had been off 6 percent so far this season. In November it was off about 3 percent. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>, which came in third last season, saw its viewing rise 10 percent. `` Look for January to be critical for the networks in terms of re-establishing series viewing patterns,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Poltrack </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> vice president for marketing. He predicted that in the January sweeps, without stiff competition from independent stations and cable, and with the full schedule of strike-delayed 1988-89 network shows finally on the air, the networks might have a chance to get back some of their audience. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, with five of the top 10 series and the five top-rated movies, won the sweeps _ one of four months a year when network affiliates' ratings are measured for purposes of negotiating local advertising rates. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> had an average, prime-time rating of 15.4, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> 14.0 and CBS 12.0. Each rating point represents 904,000 households with televisions. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` The Cosby Show'' was the highest-rated network show with a rating of 26.3, down from the 32.3 the show got in November 1987. In fact, all of the top-rated series' ratings declined. <PERSON> Poltrack </PERSON> said the four-month writers' strike last summer hurt CBS the most, leaving it without some new series and fewer movies to fill in the gaps. Because of strike-caused production delays on its regular series, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> rushed to the air with the first 18 hours of its more than 30-hour `` War and Remembrance'' sequel to `` The Winds of War.'' It ended with a disappointing 18.6 rating but helped save <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> from third place in the sweeps. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> will run the remainder of the miniseries in May, said spokeswoman <PERSON> Janice </PERSON> <PERSON> Gretemeyer </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Fox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, whose affiliates are counted as independent stations, experienced a rise in ratings, 5.5 compared with 3.7 a year ago. <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> had new episodes of its most popular programs, `` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s Most Wanted'' and `` Married ... With Children,'' when the networks were in repeats. Independent stations also did well by taking over what was previously a network source of programming _ threatrical release movies. The networks have all but abandoned them as a source of ratings, said <PERSON> Poltrack </PERSON>. Meanwhile, independent stations are garnering competitive ratings by running such films as `` 48 Hours'' and `` The Godfather.'' <ORGANIZATION> HBO </ORGANIZATION>'s rating was 8.3 compared to 6.9 a year ago. That was the first increase for <ORGANIZATION> HBO </ORGANIZATION> in the five years since the networks began analyzing pay cable performance during sweeps.

 An <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> counterterrorism expert who briefed Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on secret arms sales to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> died in a plane crash in a remote area of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> while traveling under an assumed name, officials said. The Cessna T210 crashed Wednesday at a ranch 110 miles west of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, killing the Israeli, <PERSON> Amiram </PERSON> <PERSON> Nir </PERSON>, 37, and the pilot. Three other passengers were badly injured, including <PERSON> Adriana </PERSON> <PERSON> Stanton </PERSON>, 25, of <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Nir </PERSON> was traveling under the name <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Weber </PERSON>, <PERSON> Isauro </PERSON> <PERSON> Gutierrez </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <LOCATION> Michoacan </LOCATION> state attorney general, said Thursday. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s ambassador to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dov </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmorak </PERSON>, said in an interview broadcast today on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s armed forces radio that he did not know why <PERSON> Nir </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> or why he used that name. <PERSON> Gutierrez </PERSON> said engine failure was the probable cause of the crash. But <PERSON> Schmorak </PERSON> told the radio that Mexican authorities said preliminary information that suggested the crash was caused by a violent rain storm. A Foreign Ministry official in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> who spoke on condition of anonymity told the radio <PERSON> Nir </PERSON> was on private business. <PERSON> Nir </PERSON>, a former adviser on counterterrorism to two Israeli prime ministers, was an important liaison in secret arms deals involving the sale of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> weapons to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, according to testimony given to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> congressional investigators. Former White House aide <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>, who was deeply involved in the U.S.-Iranian arms transactions, suggested during congressional testimony that the <ORGANIZATION> Contra </ORGANIZATION> link _ diverting funds from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arms sales to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> to Nicaraguan rebels _ was <PERSON> Nir </PERSON>'s idea. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> denied it. <PERSON> Nir </PERSON> was sought for questioning by Special <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Prosecutor <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> insisted <PERSON> Nir </PERSON> be granted immunity from prosecution. <PERSON> Schmorak </PERSON> told the radio <PERSON> Nir </PERSON> apparently missed a regularly scheduled flight and hired a private plane. <PERSON> Gutierrez </PERSON> said <PERSON> Nir </PERSON> arrived Sunday in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and traveled to <LOCATION> Uruapan </LOCATION>, 190 miles west, to stay with friends. `` It appears he had some possible business involving shipments of products from <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Gutierrez </PERSON> said. He refused to elaborate. A state attorney general's statement identified the dead pilot as <PERSON> Pedro </PERSON> <PERSON> Espinoza </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurtado </PERSON>, 34, and the others injured as <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Joaonde </PERSON> <PERSON> Amezqua </PERSON>, 35, and <PERSON> Ester </PERSON> <PERSON> Areaga </PERSON>, 23. An airport official in <LOCATION> Uruapan </LOCATION> said the <ORGANIZATION> Cessna </ORGANIZATION> was bound for <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. The plane, belonging to <PERSON> Aerotaxis </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Uruapan </LOCATION>, took off Wednesday afternoon from <LOCATION> Uruapan </LOCATION> and crashed 30 minutes later near <LOCATION> Ciudad </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hidalgo </LOCATION>, the statement said. <PERSON> Nir </PERSON> was a close associate of <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, now foreign minister of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, prime minister from 1984-86, appointed <PERSON> Nir </PERSON> adviser on counterterrorism in 1985 and assigned him to serve as liaison with <PERSON> North </PERSON>. In January 1986, <PERSON> Nir </PERSON> met in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> with <PERSON> North </PERSON> and Adm. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>, the National Security adviser, and proposed to renew arms shipments to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Nir </PERSON> also met with <PERSON> North </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, discussing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arms sales to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> through <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the diversion of profits to the Contras, despite a congressional ban on military aid to the rebels. <PERSON> Nir </PERSON> also traveled to <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, in May 1986 with <PERSON> North </PERSON> and former <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> Adviser <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON> to discuss the release of American hostages held by pro-Iranian extremists in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in return for the supply of anti-aircraft Hawk missiles. <PERSON> Nir </PERSON> briefed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on the program involving <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> weapons sales to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> on July 27, 1986. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has said he does not remember much about the briefing, but his aide <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> attended the meeting and took notes. <PERSON> Nir </PERSON>, a former journalist, remained on after <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> succeeded <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> as prime minister in October 1986, and the Iran-Contra affair exploded that November. He resigned this year. <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> leaders admitted selling weapons to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> but only in cooperation with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> also denied any knowledge of the Contra connection.

 <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> defense ministers tackled the potentially divisive issue of how to fairly share the cost of maintaining the alliance, officials said today at the conclusion to a two-day meeting. The defense ministers agreed `` there are significant variations in the scale and nature of their contributions,'' but the final communique said <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> remained steadfast partners. `` Once and for all it is clear this is not a matter of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> versus the rest of the alliance, this is a joint alliance effort,'' <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Manfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Woerner </PERSON> said. However, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Secretary of Defense <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> stressed the report showed `` nations are not bearing a fair share of the common defense burden,'' an issue that caused <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> congressional critics to raise the prospect of withdrawing some of the 326,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops stationed in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> said it was now <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s task to create an `` effective follow-up in a manner that serves to strengthen the cohesion of the alliance and allied defense capabilities.'' <PERSON> Woerner </PERSON> said the meeting achieved that. `` We did not only deliver words but deeds,'' <PERSON> Woerner </PERSON> said. `` We did not only speak of improving our defense effort and burden sharing but we took decisions.'' The ministers approved additional funds for transferring <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> F-16 fighter jets from <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and cleared the way for a study on a multinational European military unit in northern <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. A 79-page report approved Thursday has already produced a number of specific commitments by members to improve their contributions, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s secretary of state for defense, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Younger </PERSON>, said. The report asked <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> to make bigger budget contributions. `` The differences between some individual national contributions are glaring,'' said the report, which urged most <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> allies to boost defense spending, upgrade military equipment and become more active partners. The report offered a response to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> critics who claim <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> is not doing enough to maintain <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s strength, officials said. Guy Coeme, defense minister for <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, warned the report should `` not be used for mutual reproaches'' but to boost the `` collective effort'' for common defense. The report went beyond analyzing the financial cost to highlight the social cost of the <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> allies who provide facilities, territory and troops to maintain a credible defense in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Many European nations proposed additional efforts, officials said, including a plan to introduce a multinational European military unit in northern <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The project is only in the initial stage of study but <PERSON> Younger </PERSON> urged <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> as a whole should profit from the intitiative. The report estimated the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> spent an average 5.98 percent of its economic output on defense from 1983 to 1987. Tops was <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>, which spent 6.52 percent. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> devoted 5.01 percent of its gross domestic product to defense; <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> 4 percent, and <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> 3.2 percent. Others were: <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, 3.26 percent; <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, 2.17 percent; <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>, 2.2 percent; <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, 2.16 percent; <LOCATION> Luxembourg </LOCATION>, 1.18 percent; <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, 3.32 percent; <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>, 2.93 percent; <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>, 3.22 percent; and <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, 2.37 percent. <LOCATION> Iceland </LOCATION> was not included in the table.

 The arrests of seven people suspected of manufacturing and distributing the synthetic drug `` <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> white,'' which has been linked to 13 deaths, has shut down one supplier of the drug, police said. Authorities suspect as many as 60 people overdosed on the `` designer drug'' methylfentanyl, which was sold by itself or mixed with heroin or cocaine, <LOCATION> Allegheny </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Coroner <PERSON> Joshua </PERSON> <PERSON> Perper </PERSON> said. The drug also is suspected in seven other deaths, he said. The drug produces a euphoria similar to that of heroin but is hundreds of times more powerful. The small quantities needed to be effective makes it more difficult to detect. Police informants say the drug has disappeared from the street in the last 10 days, <ORGANIZATION> Assistant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> Chief <PERSON> Chester </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> said. The arrests shut down one <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> source of the drug, but there may be other sources, Police Chief <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Pampena </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Schaefers </PERSON>, 48, a professional chemist, was arrested Thursday night at his home in suburban <PERSON> Aspinwall </PERSON>, police said. Officers confiscated eqiupment from a basement laboratory in the house, where <PERSON> Schaefers </PERSON> lived with his elderly parents. `` We feel he's the one who put it together,'' said Detective <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Fox </PERSON>. `` All of our evidence points to that.'' Arrested earlier Thursday in raids on five Pittsburgh-area homes were <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Sunkin </PERSON>, 39, of <LOCATION> Springdale </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurley </PERSON>, 31, of <LOCATION> Bellevue </LOCATION>; <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hricak </PERSON>, 42, of <LOCATION> Bellevue </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, 33, of <LOCATION> Harmarville </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Kathryn </PERSON> <PERSON> McNally </PERSON>, 38, of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kensington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Westmoreland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>; and <PERSON> Brenda </PERSON> <PERSON> Ragland </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, 40, of <LOCATION> Bellevue </LOCATION>.

 Federal agents ended the <ORGANIZATION> Mafia </ORGANIZATION>'s days of wine and roses, busting up a drug ring in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> that smuggled heroin into this country in wine bottles and shipments of flowers. The sting operation, which began in a small suburban <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION> storefront, shut down a massive American and <ORGANIZATION> Sicilian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mafia </ORGANIZATION> narcotics operation that was selling millions of dollars worth of heroin in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and cocaine in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> and federal prosecutors said Thursday. As a result of the three-year investigation, which broadened to include <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> offices nationwide, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> and Italian authorities have charged more than 200 people, including Sicilian Mafia figures and associates of the Gambino crime family in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. A total of 68 people were charged in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and 133 in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. Some of the heroin smuggled into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was liquified and put into bottles purported to be Sicilian wine, without the knowledge of the vintner. The bottles were brought from <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> by female couriers who strapped the drugs to their bodies, officials said. `` It actually looked like wine in the wine bottle,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Fox </PERSON>, assistant director of the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> office. Heroin also arrived in shipments of roses, among other subterfuges, authorities said. Although the international food trading company set up in <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION> by agents never handled any drug shipments, it allowed the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> to establish contacts with organized crime operations in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Langford </PERSON>, special agent in charge of the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION> office, said Thursday. Agents traveled to <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and posed as buyers who discussed making major drug purchases, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> said. Substantial amounts of imported heroin were sold to the Gambino Mafia family in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, which allegedly arranged for nationwide distribution, according to a complaint filed in the case in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. Some of the heroin was passed to buyers in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> pizza parlors. Other drugs were concealed in wine shipments. One of those arrested in the police roundup was <PERSON> Giuseppe </PERSON> <PERSON> Gambino </PERSON>, a nephew of <PERSON> Carlo </PERSON> <PERSON> Gambino </PERSON>, the late reputed head of the Gambino crime family. A complaint filed in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> against 28 people alleged that the organization `` obtained cocaine in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, transported the cocaine over to <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, exchanged the cocaine for heroin, so the cocaine was sold in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, and the heroin was sold in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>,'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> said. `` They found the best market for their product,'' the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney added. `` This is the largest example so far of the Mafia's involvement in cocaine, which is something that was unheard of a few years ago,'' <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> said. `` They were selling kilos of heroin for approximately $ 200,000 a kilo; they were trading in multi-kilo quantities,'' said <PERSON> Fox </PERSON>. `` There were millions and millions of dollars.'' What had started as an independent <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> probe of drug trafficking in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, code-named `` Iron Tower,'' was coordinated with the <ORGANIZATION> Buffalo </ORGANIZATION> probe when some names of suspected traffickers turned up in both, said the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>. The <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> probe was named after a town in <LOCATION> Sicily </LOCATION> called <PERSON> Torretta </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> said. One of those being sought in the case in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Tommaso </PERSON> <PERSON> Scalici </PERSON>, is an Italian citizen from <PERSON> Torretta </PERSON>, said an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Knights </PERSON>. Scalici is charged with conspiracy to distribute heroin. The operation in <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION> began when agents learned from an informer in a 1983 drug bust that organized crime families in <LOCATION> Sicily </LOCATION> wanted to set up an import-export company as a front for drug operations. Buffalo was chosen because of its proximity to the Canadian border, <PERSON> Knights </PERSON> said, adding that the Peace Bridge connecting <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Erie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION>, was an entry point for earlier drug shipments from <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Undercover agents began working on the case, dubbed BUSICO _ an acronym for the Buffalo-Sicilian Connection, in 1985. With the cooperation of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Customs office in <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> rented a storefront in a shopping plaza in the <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Hamburg </LOCATION> and set up the company called <ORGANIZATION> BSC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wholesale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The export-import business, which did buy and sell tomato paste and olive oil, never materialized as a major drug distribution point. But at the same time, the <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION> agents began making purchases of heroin, cocaine and other drugs from various drug dealers who claimed to have international connections. Most of the deals took place in other cities and gradually came to involve <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> offices throughout the country, <PERSON> Langford </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Vacco </PERSON> called the operation `` a classic sting.'' Arrests were made in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>; and <LOCATION> Rockford </LOCATION>, Ill. In <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, arrests were being made in <LOCATION> Palermo </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Bologna </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Florence </LOCATION>.

 A woman who claims to be a <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> agent said today she hates <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> leaders for ordering her to blow up a South Korean jetliner last year with 115 people aboard, news reports said. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hyon-hui </PERSON>, 26, made the comment when government prosecutors questioned her behind closed doors to determine her role in the destruction of a Korean Air -LRB- KAL -RRB- Boeing 707 that disappeared near <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> Nov. 29, 1987. She has said she planted a bomb aboard the plane. Hundreds of students demanding a parliamentary probe into Miss <PERSON> Kim </PERSON>'s case battled riot police today at <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Yonsei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. Students hurled firebombs and rocks at riot police, who retaliated with tear gas grenades, but there were no immediate reports of injuries in the one-hour clash. Government prosecutors, who must determine whether to file formal charges against Miss <PERSON> Kim </PERSON>, said she admitted most allegations against her and aplogized for what she had done. They declined to elaborate on their interrogation. Local newspapers said Miss <PERSON> Kim </PERSON>'s voice cracked when she told prosecutors she had killed many people and must be be punished. Miss <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> strongly denounced <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Il </PERSON> <PERSON> Sung </PERSON> and his son and heir apparent <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Jong </PERSON> <PERSON> Il </PERSON>, according to <ORGANIZATION> Yonhap </ORGANIZATION>, the South Korean news agency. `` Now, I hate them most,'' she was quoted as saying. It was Miss <PERSON> Kim </PERSON>'s first public appearance since Jan. 15, when she confessed in a televised news conference to being trained and ordered by North Korean leaders to bomb the plane to disrupt this year's Olympic Games in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> have been bitter rivals since their land was divided in 1945. The North wanted to be a co-host of the Olympics. Miss <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> has been in custody of the <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Planning </ORGANIZATION>, the main <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> intelligence organization, since she was extradited from <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> last year. Tight security was in force hours before she arrived at the <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> District Prosecutor's office. Hundreds of plainclothes police were posted on the streets and atop nearby buildings. Miss <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> arrived in a sedan, accompanied by two intelligence officers. Unlike most suspects, she was not wearing handcuffs. <ORGANIZATION> Yonhap </ORGANIZATION>, quoting unidentified prosecution sources, said the day's questioning also centered on Miss <PERSON> Kim </PERSON>'s family and educational background in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> Miss <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> and a male companion, traveling on forged Japanese passports, were among passengers aboard the <ORGANIZATION> KAL </ORGANIZATION> flight from <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>. The couple, posing as father and daughter, left the plane during a stopover in <LOCATION> Abu </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dhabi </LOCATION>. They took poison when police tried to question them at <LOCATION> Bahrain </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. The man died. Under South Korean law, Miss <PERSON> Kim </PERSON>'s appearance before the prosecution was to determine whether formal charges should be filed against her. If formal charges are filed, she will be put on trial. Miss <PERSON> Kim </PERSON>, if found guilty, could be sentenced to death under <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s Criminal Code and national security and aviation laws.

<HEAD>DOE Prepares Formal Criteria For Restart Of SRP Nuclear Reactors</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AUGUSTA, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> officials have set guidelines for restarting the nuclear reactors that are the nation's source of tritium for nuclear warheads The guidelines, which include calls for unannounced inspections and setting training and safety standards consistent with those in place for commercial nuclear reactors, clear the way for a restart of the three <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plant </LOCATION> reactors _ the only ones now capable of supplying the nation's stockpile of tritium. Due to problems encountered during an August restart of P-Reactor, <ORGANIZATION> DOE </ORGANIZATION> officials have kept the reactors off line until the guidelines for reactor restarts could be written. The reactors remain shut down for maintenance and safety upgrades. On Tuesday, DOE Secretary <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Herrington </PERSON> said the department hopes to restart K-Reactor at the <LOCATION> Aiken </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, plant by late spring or early summer. Details on the new guidelines, which have not been made public, were obtained by the <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> bureau, according to a story published in the Augusta-based <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> newspapers. The news service quoted unidentified sources in the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> as saying the restart of the K-Reactor and other reactors will be keyed to implementation of the specific goals outlined in the report. Deadlines for complying with the goals set out in the report will be established in a few weeks, the news service said. The report calls for improvements in plant systems and components to assure that the reactors can operate as designed within pre-set margins of safety. Among its specific guidelines, the report calls for the addition of a fifth work shift per reactor, hiring shift supervisors with four-year science or technical degrees, adding of an engineer certified by the <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> to each shift, offering more advanced training for reactor operators and setting training standards that are consistent with the commercial nuclear industry. Another area of the report calls for standard maintenance and testing procedures, new safety analysis criteria and revised procedures for reporting unusual reactor incidents to DOE officials. The report also calls for improved on-site technical vigilance and monitoring, including increased use of on-site engineers backed by outside experts and consultants; implementation of more technical training programs; and requirements that reports be channeled to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Administration and congressional sources have said the nation's stockpiles of tritium, a radioactive isotope of hydrogen used to boost the yield of nuclear weapons, will be depleted badly within six months to two years

 A nursing homes representative said today a 75-volume federal consumers guide that reports poor sanitary conditions and other problems at many of the nation's nursing homes will confuse people looking for the best facility. The designer of the study, which seeks to make available the results of thousands of spot inspections, said the report gives valuable information but should not replace personal inspection by patients or relatives considering a home. The guide shows how each of the nation's 15,000 nursing homes fared in inspections conducted within the last 18 months, allowing anyone looking for a home to make comparisions within their communities. An overview showed 43 percent had substandard santitation in food services and 30 percent failed to administer drugs properly or to ensure basic hygiene for patients. The seriousness of violations was not indicated. Overall, the failure rate exceeded 15 percent in 10 of 32 categories chosen for inclusion in the report, but about 2,400 nursing homes received passing marks in all 32. `` We ca n't tell from the study what is trivial and what is important,'' said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Willging </PERSON>, executive vice president of the 9,000-member <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Care </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, the major nursing home trade group. `` The incompleteness of the data is going to conuse the American consumer.'' <PERSON> Willging </PERSON>, in an interview on <ORGANIZATION> NBC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Today'' show, noted that the report does not include serious violations, which he said are usually found in regular inspections and ordered corrected at the time they are found. By focusing on sometimes-trivial violations, it fails to give more important information about whether homes offer nutritious food that tastes good or has programs to deal with overweight patients or other problems, he said. `` The consumer does n't want to know whether two years ago -LRB- the temperature of the water in -RRB- a dishwasher was off by two degrees,'' he said. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roper </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Care </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> which oversees <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> and Medicaid and put out the report, said the 32 indicators checked in the inspections were the most important ones affecting care of the elderly. `` They are not trivial items,'' he said on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>. `` We think this is important information.'' But he also cautioned that the report should not substitute for visits to homes before one is chosen. `` It's not a definitive study of the level of care in all nursing homes,'' <PERSON> Roper </PERSON> said, referring to it as `` a snapshot of conditions fouind on a given day.'' <PERSON> Roper </PERSON>, in releasing the huge stacks of printed reports Thursday for each state, called the project `` a landmark achievement, not because it is an end in itself but because it will help people pose thoughtful, further questions in seeking out a nursing home.'' The most recent of the inspection reports forming the basis for the <ORGANIZATION> HCFA </ORGANIZATION> report were six months old, and some go back as much as 18 months. By law, the latest reports must be available for inspection on the premises of each nursing home, and both government and industry officials urged consumers to inspect them before making a final judgment on a particular facility. <PERSON> Elma </PERSON> <PERSON> Holder </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nursing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reform </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Roper </PERSON> `` should be embarrassed and ashamed to present these documents so proudly. ... At best they provide a teaser to the consumers to try to obtain a copy of the full survey report of the facility.'' She suggested conditions are worse in the nation's nursing homes than the report indicates. The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Retired </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Persons </ORGANIZATION>, on the other hand, praised the report as a `` good start'' toward full disclosure of information about nursing home quality. `` We are pleased that the federal government has taken valuable information about the quality of nursing home care out of its computers and made it available to the individuals and families who need it most,'' said <ORGANIZATION> AARP </ORGANIZATION> Executive Director <PERSON> Horace </PERSON> <PERSON> Deets </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> AARP </ORGANIZATION> has arranged to have copies of the report available at its regional offices around the nation. Copies also will be supplied to various government and private organizations concerned with nursing home standards in the various states. In addition to problems with food sanitation and drug distribution, the report found 24.7 percent failed to meet standards for isolation techniques to prevent the spread of infection and 21.6 percent failed in rehabilitative care to promote maximum physical functioning and prevent loss of ability to walk and otherwise move freely. None of the other 27 categories registered an `` unmet'' percentage above 20 percent. At the top end, the report shows that 99.7 percent of nursing homes meet requirements for discharging or transferring patients; 99.6 percent allow residents to communicate freely with others; 99.5 percent provide emergency medical services as necessary.

 Actors decorated in dollar signs pranced in the streets and posters called for boycotts of <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION> products today on the eve of the fourth anniversary of the world's worst industrial accident The death toll from the Dec. 3, 1984, gas leak at the Union Carbide pesticide plant has reached 3,329, according to the <LOCATION> Madhra </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pradesh </LOCATION> state government. In the last four months, at least 188 people have died of lingering effects of the methyl isocyanate gas they inhaled, officials said. `` We are registering more than one death a day because of the effects of the gas,'' Gas Relief Commissioner <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sathyam </PERSON> said in an interview. A year ago, the death toll recorded by <PERSON> Sathyam </PERSON> and his staff stood at 2,850. Activist groups and opposition politicians have called for two days of demonstrations to commemmorative the disaster and press for relief for the victims. A $ 3 billion damage case filed by the Indian government against <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Danbury </LOCATION>, Conn.-based multinational, has yet to be resolved. Police set up barricides around the derelict pesticide plant, which was operated by <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION>'s Indian subsidary, in an effort to thwart any attempts to invade the deserted premises. The <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> has vowed that some of its followers will force their way inside on Saturday. Local theater groups today sent actors into nearby streets dressed as devils. Garbed in black costumes decorated with white dollar signs, the actors denounced what they called the imperialism of multinational corporations. Speaking in Hindi, they enacted skits in which doctors demanded huge sums of money to treat gas victims and vote-hungry politicians made unfulfilled promises of relief. Posters appeared around <LOCATION> Bhopal </LOCATION>, a city of 1 million, calling for boycotts of batteries and other Union Carbide products manufactured in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>. Another opposition party, the <ORGANIZATION> Bharatiya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Janata </ORGANIZATION>, pitched a tent opposite the Union Carbide plant, recited Hindu scriptures and prayed for the souls of the gas victims. The gas leak began when liquid methyl isocyanate leaked out of a storage tank and turned into deadly vapor as it hit the air. Union Carbide maintains that sabotage by a disgruntled employee caused the leak. The Indian government claims it was the result of negligence.

 A kidnapped <ORGANIZATION> Swiss </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> worker today sent a letter urging <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> to cooperate with his captors to `` save my life.'' The Swiss government said the hijacking and the letter, which was authenticated by the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>, is an attempt to force the release of a Shiite Moslem hijacker held in <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>. The government urged all Swiss people to leave <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, the spiritual guide of pro-Iranian <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> militants charged that <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> has hindered the release of the nine American hostages. `` I have information that the Americans are the ones who complicated the issue of the hostages,'' <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Fadlallah </PERSON> said in an interview today in the weekly magazine Ash-Shiraa. `` America is after resuming ties with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. But it wants ties resumed without making any political concession. `` <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> rejects a resumption of ties unless <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> changes its hostile policy toward <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and works out some details related to bilateral relations, including the frozen Iranian assets,'' said <PERSON> Fadlallah </PERSON>. He was referring to assets frozen in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> after militants stormed the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> in November 1979 and held 52 Americans hostage for 444 days. In <LOCATION> Bern </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> official <PERSON> Edouard </PERSON> <PERSON> Brunner </PERSON> said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Winkler </PERSON>'s letter said his abduction was intended to pressure the Swiss government. `` I was not kidnapped as a Red Cross delegate but as a Swiss citizen. My government knows what my kidnappers want from it and it has to cooperate in order to save my life,'' said the letter. Swiss authorities say they have not received demands from the kidnappers and nobody has claimed responsibility for <PERSON> Winkler </PERSON>'s abduction But, `` it looks very much like blackmail,'' <PERSON> Brunner </PERSON> told a news conference. The plane hijacker arrested in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> is <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Hariri </PERSON>, 22, a Lebanese Shiite Moslem who commandeered an Air Afrique jetliner to <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> in July 1987. He killed a French passenger before being overpowered and arrested. <PERSON> Hariri </PERSON> is to go on trial on various charges Feb. 20 in <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>'s supreme court. He could face life imprisonment. The letter was received earlier today by a Western news agency in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. It is the first news of <PERSON> Winkler </PERSON>, 32, since he was abducted at gunpoint Nov. 17 in the southern Lebanese city of <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION>. Further abductions can not be excluded, <PERSON> Brunner </PERSON> said. The government urged the 150 to 200 Swiss citizens living in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> to leave and told all Swiss to avoid traveling there for non-essential reasons such as tourism, he said. The all-Swiss <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> suspended its operations in <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION> after <PERSON> Winkler </PERSON>'s abduction and withdrew five other delegates based in the city. <PERSON> Brunner </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> will ask <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> to help secure <PERSON> Winkler </PERSON>'s freedom. `` We appeal for the help of all governments who might be able to use their moral and political influence,'' he said. <PERSON> Winkler </PERSON>'s committee said in a statement that his abduction is `` an unacceptable attack against its humanitarian mission'' and appealed for `` absolute respect'' of its personnel.

<TEXT>
 The switchboard at a <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> TV station lit up like a Christmas tree after children were urged to hold a phone near the television for the tone-activated dialing of a toll call to <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Claus </LOCATION>, station officials said. <ORGANIZATION> KTZZ </ORGANIZATION> program director <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Lutgen </PERSON> said angry parents began calling Thursday afternoon about 10 minutes into a half-hour advertisement called `` Here Comes Santa,'' produced locally by a firm called Phone Quest. The ad, including a story line and Christmas music, offered children a chance to talk with <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Claus </LOCATION> for $ 2 for the first minute and 30 cents a minute thereafter. Reproducing the sounds used by tone-activated phones, the ad could `` dial'' a telephone if its handset was held up to the TV speaker. The ad was edited at the independent station, but was not prescreened by station officials, <PERSON> Lutgen </PERSON> said. Once the complaints began pouring in, he said, he ordered that the words `` ask your parents'' be shown continuously on the screen. Under the station's contract with the production company, <ORGANIZATION> Phone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Quest </ORGANIZATION> must reimburse parents for calls made without their permission, <PERSON> Lutgen </PERSON> said. Phone Quest audio development director <PERSON> Vaughan </PERSON> <PERSON> McKelvy </PERSON> said he was concerned about the `` auto phone'' device when he worked on the ad, realizing that `` some people would be upset about it.'' <PERSON> McKelvy </PERSON> said he did n't know how many other stations agreed to broadcast the paid program. <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernstrom </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> US </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION>, the local phone company, said she could not release figures on the number of calls placed during the program.

A <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> jury deliberated less than two hours before reaching its verdict Thursday and making the award to the family of <PERSON> Jessie </PERSON> <PERSON> Larez </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gates </PERSON> denounced the decision, saying it was based on faulty evidence. Comments <PERSON> Gates </PERSON> made earlier this week to reporters, in which he said that <PERSON> Larez </PERSON> was lucky that only his nose was broken, were admitted into evidence during the trial. `` The integrity of the whole system of justice at the federal level clearly mandated that these proceedings be declared a mistrial,'' the chief said. Mayor <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> issued a statement urging that the verdict be overturned. If the judgment is upheld, the <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> must decide whether the city or Gates would have to pay the damages. The Larez family's attorney, <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Yagman </PERSON>, said the family will only accept the punitive award if it comes out of Gates' pocket. `` We want to send a message to <PERSON> Daryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Gates </PERSON> and to City Hall that this kind of lawless behavior among officers that he has ratified by his own comments and behavior will no longer be tolerated by members of this community,'' <PERSON> Yagman </PERSON> said. In October, the same jury awarded $ 90,000 to the Larez family after family members testified that police conducting the 1986 raid broke <PERSON> Larez </PERSON>'s nose, pulled the hair of one of <PERSON> Larez </PERSON>'s daughters, intimidated other members of the family and broke personal property. That judgment, against the <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, involved six gang detail officers. The department delayed a decision on appealing the award pending Thursday's verdict. During the second portion of the trial, concluded Thursday, the jury had to determine whether <PERSON> Gates </PERSON> was accountable for actions of officers who raided the <LOCATION> Larez </LOCATION> home in search of a murder weapon used in a gang slaying. The weapon was never found. Speaking to reporters Tuesday outside the courtroom of Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Takasugi </PERSON>, <PERSON> Gates </PERSON> angrily denounced <PERSON> Yagman </PERSON>, <PERSON> Larez </PERSON> and the jury. <PERSON> Yagman </PERSON> has brought several civil suits against various police agencies over the years. `` How much is a broken nose worth?'' the chief asked. `` Given the circumstances in this case ... I do n't think it's worth anything. <PERSON> Larez </PERSON> is probably lucky that's all he had broken. `` People keep asking me, ` Chief, why do n't you do something about gang killings?' I tell my officers, ` Why do n't you do something about gang killings?' And we do something, and then juries give $ 90,000.'' Deputy City Attorney <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, who defended the police department in the case, called <PERSON> Takasugi </PERSON>'s decision to allow <PERSON> Gates </PERSON>' comments as evidence `` very, very damaging. <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> defended <PERSON> Gates </PERSON>' remarks, saying `` he is entitled to fair comment just like anyone else.''

 Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> told the Belgian premier today that his refusal to extradite a pro-IRA priest has undermined confidence between their countries, British officials said. A British spokesman, who demanded anonymity, told reporters: `` Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> spoke to Premier <PERSON> Wilfried </PERSON> <PERSON> Martens </PERSON> of being mystified and deeply wounded and of confidence being dented.'' <PERSON> Martens </PERSON> told reporters he defended his position during the private meeting with Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>. His aides said her attitude was `` acerbic.'' The confrontation came just before the start of a <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> summit during which the 12-nation west European trade bloc will review progress in moves to create a borderless, single-market <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> by 1992. Officials said the <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> leaders would seek to reassure the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION>'s main trading partners, that efforts to boost trade within the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> will not be at the expense of imports. A draft statement states that a single EEC market will also benefit `` non-community countries. 1992 <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> will not close in on itself ... will not be a fortress <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> but a partnership <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.'' Earlier today, a bomb damaged an <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> office in <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION>, 270 miles from the meeting site. It was one of four that exploded in the Greek capital. Police said no one was injured. The left-wing Revolutionary Popular Struggle claimed responsibility. The <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> leaders, accompanied by their foreign ministers, started the meeting with a luncheon hosted by Greek Premier <PERSON> Andreas </PERSON> <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON>, the summit's chairman. The summit was being held at the Knights' Palace, a 14th century castle. Greek commandos armed with automatic weapons stood guard on the battlement of the castle gate as the leaders arrived. This morning, Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> also met with West German Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>, and officials said they agreed it would be useful to have a summit meeting of the leaders of the 16 <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> nations in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> in May or June 1988. A meeting between Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> and <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Haughey </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> prime minister, was canceled by <PERSON> Haughey </PERSON>, who was said to be upset over Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s criticism of <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> for failing to extradite the pro-IRA priest. Last week <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION> turned down <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s request to extradite the priest, <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>, and sent him instead to the <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>, where he has taken refuge with an undisclosed religious order. <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>, 58, had been held in a Belgian jail since his arrest in June. <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION> said the British extradition warrant, citing unspecified charges of conspiracy to murder and to bomb, was flawed. In the meeting with <PERSON> Martens </PERSON>, Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> attacked the Belgian premier over the extradition of <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>, whom British police suspect was involved in a string of <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> bombings and other terrorist related offences. <PERSON> Martens </PERSON> said he told Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, `` this decision was taken completely legally ... it was not a political decision.'' The <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>, outlawed in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, is fighting to end British rule in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> and unite the Protestant-dominated province with the Irish republic under leftist rule.

<HEAD>Legislature Refuses To Deal With Shoreham Issue</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The Legislature has allowed Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>'s deal to buy the $ 5.3 billion <LOCATION> Shoreham </LOCATION> nuclear plant for $ 1 to fall through, leaving the utility free to try to open the generating station. State lawmakers wrapped up a special session Thursday without taking action on a bill to approve the deal <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> worked out in June with <PERSON> Shoreham </PERSON>'s owners, the <ORGANIZATION> Long </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Island </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lighting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. By failing to act, <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> and the utility said the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> missed a deadline that bound both sides to the agreement The governor predicted Thursday night that the deal was over and that state lawmakers had effectively decided to open <LOCATION> Shoreham </LOCATION>. `` As far as I'm concerned, tomorrow, 12:01, Dec. 2, 1988, you ought to think of it as Black Friday,'' said <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>, who added that allowing the deadline to pass could prove to be one of the `` most tragic blunders that this Legislature ever made.'' But the utility offered no indication of its plans. <ORGANIZATION> LILCO </ORGANIZATION> scheduled a meeting of its board of directors today in <LOCATION> Hicksville </LOCATION> to discuss `` our future course regarding the settlement,'' according to utility spokesman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Lois </PERSON>. <PERSON> Lois </PERSON> would not speculate about what options <ORGANIZATION> LILCO </ORGANIZATION> might consider. The deal called for the state to buy the $ 5.3 billion Shoreham facility for $ 1 and dismantle it. In return, the utility would get guaranteed rate hikes over the next decade totaling more than 60 percent. The state, under the auspices of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION>, would build non-nuclear power plants to provide <ORGANIZATION> LILCO </ORGANIZATION> with the electricity it would lose if <LOCATION> Shoreham </LOCATION> does n't open, the deal also stipulates. <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> says <PERSON> Shoreham </PERSON> should not be allowed to open because crowded <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> could n't be safely evacuated in the event of a serious nuclear accident. The <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION>'s refusal to act on a <LOCATION> Shoreham </LOCATION> bill this week was due mainly to the determination by the nine state senators from <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, all Republicans, that the agreement as now written would be too generous to the utility and cause rates to go up higher than they have to for the utility's customers. Most of the discussion at the Capitol Thursday night in the wake of the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION>'s departure was over whether the passing of the midnight deadline really meant the end of the deal. The pro-agreement Citizens to Settle Shoreham group said legislators had `` for all practical purposes opened Shoreham.'' That organization called <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> legislators `` gutless'' for not dealing with the issue. According to <PERSON> Lois </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Shoreham </LOCATION> agreement stipulates only that the parties involved are `` free to withdraw'' starting today, not that the pact falls apart. But <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> argued by the time any new agreement is reached, <LOCATION> Shoreham </LOCATION> could be on its way to winning a license to operate from the federal <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> LILCO </ORGANIZATION> would lose its incentive to renegotiate the pact. The governor maintained that the plant could be licensed to operate as early as Dec. 12.

 The remains of five bodies, four of them confirmed to be women, have been found along two highways in southeastern <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, prompting worry that a serial killer might be behind the deaths. `` There are things that are not coincidence, that are in common,'' <LOCATION> Bristol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> District Attorney <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pina </PERSON> said after the fifth body was found Thursday. `` It would appear ... they are connected.'' `` They are all in a geographic location which is very similar,'' he said of the bodies found a couple of exits from each other along Interstate 195 and Route 140 in southeastern <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Pina </PERSON> also said his office has turned up additional evidence that it has not disclosed. State police using specially trained dogs resumed a search today of the area near where the partially clothed skeleton was found Thursday. The body was located by police dogs along Route 140 in <LOCATION> Freetown </LOCATION>, less than three miles from where the first body was discovered in July, officials said. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibney </PERSON>, a spokesman for <LOCATION> Pina </LOCATION>, said police used searchlights Thursday night but found no evidence to help the investigation. An autospy was scheduled today, he said. `` We're hoping we found the last of them and we just have to put some of the pieces together,'' <PERSON> Gibney </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Gibney </PERSON> said investigators believed the fifth victim also was a woman because of the style of the clothing, dungarees and a light shirt. He said the body was severely decomposed and may have been there for up to a year. The district attorney has linked the bodies to the disappearance of several women from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bedford </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Weld </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> area, known by police as a center for drug trading and prostitution. <PERSON> LouAnn </PERSON> <PERSON> Silva </PERSON>, a resident of <LOCATION> Weld </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>, said she worried about her 15-year-old daughter. `` I'm scared to go to the store myself,'' she said. The four also may be connected with the deaths of two women from <LOCATION> Providence </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> R.I. </LOCATION>, whose bodies were found last spring in <LOCATION> Seekonk </LOCATION> near Interstate 195 and about 10 miles away in <LOCATION> Attleboro </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Interstate </LOCATION> <LOCATION> 95 </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Pina </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Pina </PERSON> said he believes the killer was familiar with the area. `` I personally do n't believe it could have been someone traveling through,'' he said. `` It looks like it was someone who was more local, someone who knew the area, someone who felt confident enough that they could go there and drop a body off by the road and leave.'' Officials undertook the search after a body was found last month along Interstate 195 in <LOCATION> Dartmouth </LOCATION>, not far from where two bodies were discovered in July. Police dogs Tuesday found the skeletal remains of a fourth woman along the interstate in <LOCATION> Dartmouth </LOCATION>. None of the women has been positively identified. Dental records of five women reported missing here in recent months were being checked to see if they match any of the bodies. Three of the missing women were either last seen, lived near or frequented the Weld Square area. <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Giammalvo </PERSON>, whose family has run a grocery store on the corner of Weld Square since 1922, said little has changed since the first body was found. `` They -LRB- prostitutes -RRB- come in and out of here all the time. It's business as usual,'' he said

 Kids may love <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION>, but when 25 of the jolly old fellows show up en masse, the pleasure turns to terror and tears, and children run for their mothers' skirts. So it was when a festive phalanx of red-suited, black-booted <PERSON> Kris </PERSON> <PERSON> Kringles </PERSON> _ excited graduates of a <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> school _ invaded a downtown hotel lobby to a chorus of ho-ho-hos. `` I really love kids, but I did n't realize they'd be so scared,'' <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, 19, of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>, said Wednesday. `` I reached out to shake one's hand and she started crying.'' Veteran Santa <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Utecht </PERSON>, 68, with 48 years behind the beard, used the incident to teach the new dogs old tricks. `` Do n't reach down to the little ones from above or they'll retreat,'' <PERSON> Utecht </PERSON> counseled `` If you stoop to their level, you can win them over.'' The basics? Know all the reindeers' names. Forgo alcohol, tobacco and garlic. Do n't make any specific promises. And gently hold the child's hand _ it's soothing and keeps him from grabbing the beard. The St. <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> novices were enthralled with their duties, although they found the outfit a bit stifling for climates south of the North Pole. `` I'm working up a real sweat,'' <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said. `` With a little practice, we'll get used to it,'' said <PERSON> Jaymes </PERSON> <PERSON> Regualos </PERSON>, 18, of <LOCATION> Battle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, of the pillow padding and warm, silky beards. `` I love doing this. It's lots of fun.'' The bravest youngster on hand was <PERSON> Nadia </PERSON> <PERSON> Sawtarie </PERSON> from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. The 3-year-old assessed the invaders from behind her mother's skirts and then gathered the courage to venture out and offer a tentative wave before scurrying back to safety <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> is known in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, but not on such a scale, her mother said.

<TEXT>
 Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Colin </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>, the career soldier who became national security adviser in 1987, has been chosen by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to command Army forces in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The move by the 51-year-old son of Jamaican immigrants from national security adviser to full general and command of <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Forces Command would put <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> back in the running to become <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> chief of staff eventually. <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> would also become only the fourth black officer to attain four-star rank in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> armed forces if the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> confirms the nomination. He would join <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Gen. <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Randolph </PERSON> as the second black four-star officer currently on active duty. The first such officer in American history was <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Gen. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> `` Chappie'' <PERSON> James </PERSON>, who won his rank in August 1975. He died shortly after retiring in 1978. The second was Army Gen. <PERSON> Roscoe </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, who won his fourth star on Aug. 30, 1982, and retired in November 1985. In taking over <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> McPherson </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> would succeed Gen. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Palastra </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, who has held the post since June 1986 and is retiring after 35 years of active military service. The change of command will probably occur in April, the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> said. The Forces Command oversees both active duty and reserve troops in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, except <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, which falls under the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> command. The Army has 11 full generals, but sources at the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said the Forces Command position was likely to be the only four-star post to open during the next year and that rumors had been circulating for some time that <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> was in line for the job. `` The White House handled this one directly,'' said one official. A tall, husky man described as a `` soldier's soldier'' who does n't particularly like staff jobs, <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> has received uniformly high marks from official <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for his performance at the White House. White House Spokesman Marlin <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> `` have had a close personal relationship.'' `` He was the general who guided preparations for the <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> summits, who helped restructure and give new direction to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> following the Iran-Contra investigation, and who, by his personal integrity and commitment, has restored confidence in the national <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> itself,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> succeeded <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> as <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s national security adviser after <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> was tapped to replace the retiring <PERSON> Caspar </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON> as <ORGANIZATION> defense </ORGANIZATION> secretary a year ago. <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> had replaced <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Rear Adm. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>, who resigned when the arms-for-hostage affair became public. <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> first came to the attention of <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON> and <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> when he was tapped as a White House fellow in 1972. He served as <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON>'s top military aide from 1983 to 1986, then joined the <ORGANIZATION> NSC </ORGANIZATION> staff as <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>'s deputy after brief service as commander of the Army's V <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> was born in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Jamaican </LOCATION> immigrants.

 A judge today rejected <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s remaining challenges to Iran-Contra charges against him, but the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's refusal to release classified document could still scuttle the major charges <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> rejected the last of the former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aide's pre-trial motions. North had moved to dismiss charges that he obstructed congressional inquiries into press reports he was violating a ban on helping the Nicaraguan rebels, known as Contras. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON>'s rulings capped a series of decisions on <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s 37 pre-trial motions that left intact 14 of the 16 charges against the former <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> aide. But major counts against <PERSON> North </PERSON> could be dropped if <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> decides the defense can not argue its case without classified documents being withheld by the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> insists that the documents are being withheld for national security reasons, and says the decision is not a ploy to prevent North from going to trial. `` The things we're blocking are the things that duty requires we block,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said Thursday. `` These are things that are national security secrets.'' Asked if the move were a backdoor maneuver to keep the case against <PERSON> North </PERSON> from going to trial, he replied: `` No, this is something that from the very beginning we knew we would have to do.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was questioned at the beginning of a meeting on forthcoming trade talks. Although he defended the decision to withhold documents from the trial, he backed away from his previous insistence that <PERSON> North </PERSON> and his former boss, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>, are innocent. On June 27, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had said: `` I believe in the innocence of the two men and I would like to see that established once and for all.'' On Thursday, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said, `` At this stage I do n't think I should comment on guilt or innocence or anything of this kind. I think the law has got to take its course.'' Still, the decision to withhold classified documents could enable <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s lawyers to claim that he is being prevented from presenting a full defense to the key allegation against him _ that he conspired illegally to divert more than $ 14 million in profits from the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's secret <LOCATION> Iranian </LOCATION> weapons deals to the Nicaraguan Contra rebels. <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s lawyers claim that they need some 40,000 pages of secret documents to defend him. Independent counsel <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>, the special prosecutor assigned to the case, has indicated he can proceed without use of the classified information. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said heads of government agencies concerned with national security decided in July not to release some material sought for the trial. He said <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> indicated at the time that he could prosecute North on the basis of unclassified material. North's lawyers, however, are insisting on use of the classified material. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> today resumed closed hearings on defense objections to deleting classified material from 350 prosecution exhibits. The secret materials bear most heavily on two charges relating to the diversion _ conspiracy and theft of government property. However, <PERSON> North </PERSON> also could be tried on charges he made false statements to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and conspired to use a tax-exempt foundation for a non-exempt purpose _ raising money for the Contras. In a court filing made public late Thursday, <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> disclosed some of the types of information that the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration is preventing him from using. It includes the already widely publicized names of several Central American countries, and the names of officials from those nations, involved in aiding the Contras. <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>'s document also indicates that the administration is trying to suppress the names of nations from which it tried to solicit secret contributions for the Contras, including <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> has offered a briefing to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON>, who is scheduled to preside over <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s trial, but had not received a response. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said it was `` up to the judge'' to decide if the classified material is relevant to <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s defense and, if it is, whether the indictments against him should be dismissed or he should be tried. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> said recently that he would have little power to control the flow of information once the trial started, but noted that the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> had legal and constitutional means at its disposal to prevent disclosures. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said White House officials realized, when they heard this, that <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> had not been advised of the action that had been taken in July. Consequently, White House Counsel A.B. <PERSON> Culvahouse </PERSON> wrote <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> a letter on the issue. Of the 40,000 or so pages sought by <PERSON> North </PERSON>, the administration advised <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> that `` there is information in those documents that we know we can not declassify,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, meanwhile, reiterated that he is opposed to a presidential pardon for North and the other Iran-Contra defendants while the criminal case is pending. He said pardons would leave them `` under a shadow of guilt for the rest of their lives.''

<HEAD>Blood Bank Held Responsible For Transfusion-Related AIDS Case</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A jury verdict that found a blood bank negligent for allowing an infant to get AIDS through a transfusion will affect hundreds of similar cases across the country, an attorney says. Additionally, the nation's blood supply could be significantly improved if blood banks raise their standards in light of Thursday's decision, a key witness in the case said In a verdict believed to be the first of its kind, a jury found the <ORGANIZATION> Irwin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Blood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> was negligent in failing to properly screen its blood supply for the virus that causes AIDS. The jury also found that the blood bank, which supplies blood to about 40 hospitals in eight counties in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, erred when it rejected requests by the boy's family and friends to donate blood for the transfusions. `` It shows blood banks that they are indeed vulnerable to jury verdicts,'' said plaintiff's attorney <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Moriarty </PERSON>. The suit was filed on behalf of <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Osborn </PERSON>, now 5 -LCB-, who was three weeks old when he received AIDS-contaminated blood in 1983 during surgery for a congenital heart defect. He tested positive for the AIDS virus in September 1987. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> now has a brain tumor and lymphoma. He has only a few months to live, said <PERSON> Moriarty </PERSON>. The jury awarded <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> $ 550,000 in compensatory damages. His parents were awarded $ 200,000 to pay for past and future medical and nursing bills. Superior Court Judge <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Ertola </PERSON> did not allow the jury to consider awarding punitive damages, nor was the jury allowed to give the parents any damages for pain and suffering, said <PERSON> Moriarty </PERSON>. <PERSON> Moriarty </PERSON> said the financial cost may motivate blood banks to `` police themselves more than they are now.'' He said hundreds of similar cases are pending across the country. The blood bank plans to appeal, said <PERSON> Irwin </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON> <PERSON> Barr </PERSON>. <PERSON> Barr </PERSON> defended <PERSON> Irwin </PERSON>'s decisions in the case. `` In February of 1983, there was only one case of AIDS from a transfusion in the world,'' he said. `` There was not evidence at that time that this was a disease transmitted by blood.'' But Dr. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Asher </PERSON>, a key witness for the family, disputed <PERSON> Barr </PERSON>'s assertion that there was no evidence in 1983 that AIDS was transmitted by blood. `` Everybody knew it,'' he said. <PERSON> Asher </PERSON>, founder and chairman of <ORGANIZATION> HemaCare </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a private, for-profit blood bank in <LOCATION> Sherman </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Oaks </LOCATION>, called the verdict `` a marvelous thing.'' `` Any time more pressure is put on the blood bankers to improve the quality of their product, the better it'll be for the members of the public who receive it,'' he said. Both <PERSON> Barr </PERSON> and <PERSON> Asher </PERSON> said it was the first time a blood bank had been found responsible for a transfusion-related AIDS case. Other cases have gone to court, but have not resulted in verdicts. <PERSON> Asher </PERSON> said that although many blood banks have improved their screening and recruiting in the past few years, others have not. `` Much of the blood industry is still dragging their feet,'' he said. `` Rather than working harder and recruiting harder, they're willing to let questionable blood and questionable donors go through their system. <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Osborn </PERSON>, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON>'s mother, said she and her husband were thrilled by the jury's decision. `` We just feel this is a great moral victory,'' she said. `` I think the blood industry, particularly in high-risk areas like <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, has got to shape up.'' Acquired immune deficiency syndrome destroys the body's immune system, leaving victims vulnerable to infections. The virus is spread most often through sexual contact, needles or syringes shared by drug abusers, infected blood or blood products, and from pregnant women to their offspring. As of Dec. 1, 79,389 cases had been reported since June 1981, and 44,590, or 56 percent of all victims, had died.

 A senior <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> diplomat said today that member states will pass a resolution to move the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> to <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> so <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, barred from entering the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, can address the body. On Thursday night, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> refused the assembly's request to grant <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> a visa <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> planned to speak about the Palestinian situation. `` This reply from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is negative and will be contained in a report by the secretary-general to come out tomorrow morning,'' <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> said Thursday night. A diplomat who saw the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>' response said it was `` extremely negative.'' It replied to a <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> resolution urging <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to reverse its decision and respond within 24 hours. The resolution passed 151-2 Wednesday, with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> opposed. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said it denied <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> a visa because he encourages and condones terrorism by the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> has said it does not object to the assembly shifting to <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> and would participate in a session held there. The senior <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> diplomat, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the resolution would be introduced to the General Assembly this afternoon and would pass by tonight. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> comptroller <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON> confirmed the Arab nations introduced their resolution before one of two budgetary committees that must consider it before it goes before the whole Assembly. Arab and <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> sources said the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> session would be held sometime Dec. 12-16. Revised estimates put the cost of the session at $ 500,000, said the Arab diplomat. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> has said he wants to explain the new position taken by the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> in its recent meeting in <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION>. The council, the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s parliament-in-exile, implicitly recognized <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right to exist, accepting key <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> resolutions on the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> calling for negotiations with states in the region. A rally planned to welcome <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> on Thursday turned into a protest outside the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. About 400 people including Palestinians and a few dozen anti-Zionist Orthodox Jews denounced the visa denial. Waving <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> flags and pictures of <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, the demonstrators chanted `` Long Live the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>.'' Holding anti-Zionist banners were ultra-Orthodox Jewish men in long black coats and wide-brimmed hats. Orthodox Jews Against Zionism believe God has forbidden the Jewish people to have their own state. <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> is the European headquarters of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>.

 A leader of <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>'s anti-communist insurgency today criticized the pending agreement that will provide for the withdrawal of Cuban troops from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, contending that the accord undercounts the Cuban presence by 10,000. <PERSON> Jeremias </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Chitunda </PERSON>, vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> forces since 1986, said the agreement being negotiated in U.S.-mediated talks calls for the withdrawal of 50,000 Cuban forces over a 27-month period. <PERSON> Chitunda </PERSON> said in an interview that the removal of that number of Cubans would still leave 10,000 at the disposal of <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>'s leftist government after the withdrawal timetable ends. In addition, he said, 20,000 other Cubans have been given Angolan citizenship and are capable of providing assistance to the Angolan Army. `` There is very little in it for us to rejoice about,'' <PERSON> Chitunda </PERSON> said, alluding to the agreement being worked out by officials from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said it stands by its estimate that the Cuban troop presence numbers about 50,000. It also disputed <PERSON> Chitunda </PERSON>'s claim that 20,000 Cubans have acquired Angolan citizenship. Final details of the agreement were being negotiated this week in the Congolese capital of <LOCATION> Brazzaville </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Chester </PERSON> <PERSON> Crocker </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s top official for <LOCATION> African </LOCATION> affairs, is serving as mediator for the talks. In addition to the withdrawal of Cuban troops, the accord is also aimed at bringing about independence and black majority rule in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, a colony of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. A treaty implementing the agreement is expected to be ready for signature in a few weeks. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has been providing assistance to <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> since 1985 but <PERSON> Chitunda </PERSON>'s remarks reflect what has been an undercurrent of uneasiness between the two allies. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> has been <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION>'s main supplier but that role is expected to end once South African forces depart <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> as part of the independence process in the territory. <PERSON> Chitunda </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> has become increasingly self-sufficient and should be able to survive a South African aid suspension. Another shortcoming of the agreement, <PERSON> Chitunda </PERSON> said, is that it does not provide for a process of national reconciliation in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, which has been plagued by civil war since independence in 1975. He said that <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION>'s main political objective is negotiations with Angolan authorities leading to a process of national reconciliation and multi-party democracy. `` We do not seek military superiority,'' he said. `` We do not seek military victory.'' Angolan officials have refused to hold national reconciliation talks, calling instead on the <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> rebels to take advantange of a government amnesty offer.

 Two South African government ministers joined U.S.-mediated talks today aimed at wrapping up an interim agreement on a <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> troop withdrawal from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and independence for <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. But Defense Minister <PERSON> Magnus </PERSON> <PERSON> Malan </PERSON>, who flew to the Congolese capital today with Foreign Minister <PERSON> Pik </PERSON> <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>, said there was a `` serious hitch'' in the talks, the independent <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Africa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> reported. `` This is the time when the pitfalls start appearing,'' <PERSON> Malan </PERSON> was quoted as saying by the news agency. The report did not elaborate. One reported disagreement has involved <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s insistence on a reliable system for verifying the withdrawal of 50,000 Cuban troops supporting <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>'s Marxist government in fighting a rebel war. A statement issued in <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION> before their arrival in <LOCATION> Brazzaville </LOCATION> said it was hoped the agreement would be signed today or Saturday. In any case, further negotiations will be required after the signing of what is to be called the <LOCATION> Brazzaville </LOCATION> Protocol, before a formal treaty is signed. The formal agreement was to be signed in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, perhaps next month. Delegations from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> arrived earlier this week for what was expected to be a final round of negotiations on the details of agreements ironed out in the past six months of U.S.-mediated talks. <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>'s government is fighting a 13-year-old war with the <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> rebel movement. <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> receives assistance from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION>, which has not been a party to the peace talks, has vowed to continue fighting. The protocol also calls for <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> to begin granting independence to <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, also known as <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> has administered the territory for 73 years. The Weekly Mail newspaper in <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> reported that <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> forces have been moving from southern <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> into <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>. However, the South African military has denied <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> has any guerrilla fighters in <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 A school reform measure for <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> that calls for the creation of local school councils and a new central <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> has overwhelmingly won the approval of the <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>. Final approval came on a 98-8 vote in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> late Thursday. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approved it 56-1 earlier in the evening. `` I think that it is a good bill, well-balanced, well-founded, and I am very hopeful that it will make significant change in the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> school system,'' said House Speaker <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Madigan </PERSON>. The bill represents the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>'s second effort on school reform. A Democratic-drafted bill was approved in July but was abandoned early in the fall session amid a partisan dispute over changes proposed by Gov. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>. Drafted by a bipartisan legislative group, the measure is designed to shift the balance of power in the school system by trimming the central school bureaucracy and creating local school councils with authority to appoint principals at each of the city's 592 public schools Principals will be given more authority over hiring and over attempts to improve the work of teachers who are deemed unsatisfactory. The current 11-member <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> will be replaced with a seven-member interim board to be appointed by the mayor. A school board nominating commission will make recommendations to the mayor for a permanent 15-member board. The existing <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> will serve as a watchdog over the reform effort, and can suspend or fire any school board member or employee who does n't comply with its directives. Lawmakers of both parties acknowledged the bill dealt primarily with the management of the school system but did not address such issues as overcrowding, dropouts and early childhood education that require major funding increases.

 Infantry units mutinied today at a large army base outside the capital, and a rebel officer said the move was aimed at replacing the army chief and not civilian President <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON>. It was unclear how many soldiers were taking part in the insurrection, and there were no reports of gunfire or injuries by early afternoon. The <PERSON> Campo </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Mayo </PERSON> base was the fourth military outpost reporting unrest in two days. The army sent loyal troops to the base and reported other bases nationwide were calm. Vice President <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> convened emergency meetings to discuss the rebellion with <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> ministers and military chiefs. <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> is in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to address the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>. The rebel officer, who identified himself only as an aide to Col. <PERSON> Mohamed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Seineldin </PERSON>, said the revolt was not against <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> government. `` Our posture is one of absolute respect for the Constitution,'' he said in a telephone interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. He said the rebellion was aimed at toppling the army chief, Gen. <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Dante </PERSON> <PERSON> Caridi </PERSON>. <PERSON> Seineldin </PERSON> `` is raising arms against the authorities of the force in a definitive attempt to restore the honor of the army and its historic role,'' the officer said from the base, 20 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Buenos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aires </LOCATION>. The insurrection followed incidents Thursday in which 53 coast guard men armed themselves and deserted their base and an captain attempted to incite infantry troops at <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tablada </LOCATION>, west of <LOCATION> Buenos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aires </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said the captain was arrested. Government officials had believed those incidents, and another failed uprising at an army communications facility in <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bell </LOCATION>, 25 miles south of the capital, had been isolated. Today they were treating the Campo de Mayo revolt as part of the same unrest and trying to make sure there were no other pockets of dissent. The elite <ORGANIZATION> coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> guard </ORGANIZATION> unit on Thursday deserted their base in three trucks, into which they loaded four light machine guns, 200 rifles, 30 handguns and 100,000 rounds of ammunition, officials said. The <ORGANIZATION> Diario </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> y </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Noticias </ORGANIZATION> news agency reported the <ORGANIZATION> coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> guard </ORGANIZATION> unit was inside the <ORGANIZATION> Campo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mayo </ORGANIZATION> base today. At the base, no clashes were reported, but rebels in combat gear put a heavy machine gun at the entrance to the military school and took in weapons. The military action was denounced on all sides. `` No action of this type is capable of threatening democracy,'' said <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Angeloz </PERSON>, presidential candidate of <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Radical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Menem </PERSON>, the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Peronist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> candidate in the May 1988 elections, said: `` If it were necessary, I do n't doubt the Argentine people would mobilize in defense of democracy.'' Elements within the army have complained about <PERSON> Caridi </PERSON>'s leadership, the selection of officers for promotion and retirement, the military budget that under <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> has shrunk by half, and pay that has not kept pace with 332 percent inflation Officers also are unhappy about the resumption of trials against colleagues charged with human rights abuses in the crackdown on leftist subversion during the 1976-83 dictatorship. The 1987 and 1988 uprisings led by Lt. Col. <PERSON> Aldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Rico </PERSON>, now discharged and imprisoned, were motivated to support fellow officers being prosecuted in civilian courts, and reflected the unwillingness of colleagues who were called to testify. During the dictatorship, kidnappings, bombings and assassinations by leftist groups were curtailed, but at least 9,000 Argentines `` disappeared'' and were presumed executed by security forces, a government commission reported. In December 1985, five former junta members, including former military presidents <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Videla </PERSON> and <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Viola </PERSON>, were convicted in civilian court for crimes including kidnapping, torture and murder.

 A federal judge today approved a precedent-setting order requiring the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> to be subject to <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> environmental regulations in a $ 1 billion cleanup of the agency's Fernald uranium processing plant. <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> Attorney General <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Celebrezze </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> and Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, said the decree, negotiated by federal and state attorneys, is historic because it gives the state a court-enforceable order to pressure the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to clean up the plant. <PERSON> Celebrezze </PERSON> and <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> said it is the first such agreement they know of. <PERSON> Celebrezze </PERSON> and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shank </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> director, said <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> will use the order to force the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to clean up the plant and pay for its cost, estimated at $ 1 billion. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Spiegel </PERSON> signed the agreement this morning in <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Celebrezze </PERSON> said. The accord covers the Feed Materials Production Center in <LOCATION> Fernald </LOCATION>, which state officials blame for contamination of air and water at the 1,050-acre site 18 miles north of <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>. The plant enriches uranium for nuclear power plants and for the government's nuclear research efforts The announcement of the agreement Thursday came as the plant's operator announced plans to lay off 350 workers because of decreased demand for its product <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> said <PERSON> Fernald </PERSON>'s problems date through 35 years of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> administrations and predecessors to the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, as well as today's administration. `` There's plenty of blame to go around,'' said <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON>, who conducted a 1984 congressional hearing to help bring to public attention <PERSON> Fernald </PERSON>'s environmental problems of stored radioactive wastes and atmospheric releases of radioactive uranium oxide dust. Production at the 37-year-old Feed Materials Production Center has been halted since the start of a strike by union workers Oct. 7. <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> estimates it will cost $ 175 billion to clean up 17 federal nuclear sites during the next 35 years. He said only $ 300 million is budgeted for the job in the coming year. Today's agreement resulted from negotiations prompted by two <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> lawsuits, filed in 1986 and 1987, against the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. The agreement, in the form of a court decree, requires the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to pay more than $ 1 million as a result of the lawsuits. The plant also is the subject of a $ 300 million class action in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> on behalf of <LOCATION> Fernald </LOCATION> neighbors who contend the plant has radioactively contaminated the environment, posed a health hazard and ruined property values. <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON>, spokeswoman for <ORGANIZATION> Fernald </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Residents </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>, declined to comment specifically on the agreement until she reviews it. But, she said, `` I want to see this thing written in stone, etched in stone, and it's got to be enforceable.'' <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Oak </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ridge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, operations, which include the Fernald plant, said the agreement is evidence of the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s intent to clean up <PERSON> Fernald </PERSON>, but is not an admission of wrongdoing. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Grone </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s manager of <ORGANIZATION> Oak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ridge </ORGANIZATION> operations, said this week that the government will have spent $ 355 million by the end of fiscal 1989 on cleanup and work place safety efforts already under way at <LOCATION> Fernald </LOCATION>. The plant sits above the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> aquifer, a water source for 2 million people. The Energy Department has admitted the plant has emitted at least 300,000 pounds of radioactive uranium dust into the atmosphere. <PERSON> Shank </PERSON> said the state is concerned that contaminated wastes from the plant could eventually pollute the aquifer. Water sampling has not revealed any notable contamination in regional public water supplies, but monitoring will continue, <PERSON> Shank </PERSON> told reporters. Also Thursday, <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Materials </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, the plant's operator, said it would lay off 350 workers Spokesman <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelley </PERSON> said the layoffs will affect about 250 hourly and about 100 salaried employees. He said the layoffs were not prompted by a strike by the plant's 625 union production workers, which has idled the facility since Oct. 7. Some employees foresaw difficulties in cleaning up the 37-year-old plant if workers are laid off. `` It will about destroy the place as far as cleanup goes,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Warren </PERSON>, who has worked at the <LOCATION> Fernald </LOCATION> plant for seven years. `` If they're being honest about cleaning up the plant, then they would n't lay off 250 of the people who know how to do the cleanup,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Atomic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trades </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, which represents the 14 unions at the plant. <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> laid off 70 employees at the plant in April because of declining orders for uranium and said then that more layoffs were likely. <PERSON> Fernald </PERSON> currently employs about 1,500 people.

<HEAD>Grand Jury Blames Philadelphia Inspections Office For Six Fires</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A grand jury has blamed mismanagement in the city's <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Licenses </ORGANIZATION> and Inspections for at least six fires since 1984 that caused more than $ 23 million in damage and killed two people. The agency is a `` bureaucracy that does not react to danger,'' said District Attorney <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Castille </PERSON>. The <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> grand jury condemned the city department's exclusive enforcement of the fire code, but did not accuse any official of wrongdoing. The grand jury said the system was at fault rather than the people. `` The present system promotes inefficiency by permitting decisions without accountability, ignoring advice from the fire department, failing to follow up field inspector requests for action and failing to coordinate and utilize the information in its system,'' the grand jury said Thursday. <PERSON> Castille </PERSON> sent a letter to Mayor <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> <PERSON> Goode </PERSON> urging him and the <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> to strip the department of its fire code enforcement power and put the fire department in charge. City officials had no response today. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolfe </PERSON>, the assistant district attorney who handled the grand jury investigation, said inspectors did their jobs on the six buildings that later burned, but their reports `` went into the black hole of L & amp; I, where their supervisors did nothing.'' The grand jury review of inspection and licensing agency practices covered six fires between May 1984 and December 1987, including the Nov. 7, 1984, explosion at the Publicker Distillery, where two workers died, and a nine-alarm fire on May 3, 1984, that caused an estimated $ 20 million in damage to 17 buildings. The panel also recommended that criminal charges be filed against one building owner who allegedly ignored safety citations and the owner of a company that installs fire alarm and sprinkler systems for allegedly illegally obtaining an occupancy permit.

 <LOCATION> WINSTON-SALEM </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ The record buyout of <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> has stirred dreams of big stock profits and hopes that the company's corporate headquarters would return to this tobacco city, but it also brought fears of layoffs `` I think the general feeling is one of uncertainty,'' <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Nordenholz </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Winston-Salem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>, said Thursday. `` There are lots of mixed feelings about what's happening. The food and tobacco giant was auctioned off to buyout firm <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roberts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> late Wednesday in a $ 24.53 billion deal valued at about $ 109 a share in cash and securities. That is virtually double the stock's price before management started a bidding war six weeks ago and represents a big windfall for this city. Analysts estimate that about 9,000 people in the area plus local trusts, foundations and retirement plans own stock now worth a little more than $ 2 billion. At <ORGANIZATION> Windsor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jewelers </ORGANIZATION> in downtown <LOCATION> Winston-Salem </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Lois </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> said she has already noticed an influx of potential new customers who appear to be looking for ways to spend the proceeds they will get from the sale of their stock. `` These are definitely not typical of the clientele that would be pricing our emeralds and diamonds,'' she said. However, <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said stories of production-line workers becoming millionaires were `` a bit overstated.'' `` There are some people who are suddenly quarter-millionaires, on paper anyway,'' he said. Some local businessmen hope <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> will return its corporate headquarters, which were shifted to <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> last year, to <LOCATION> Winston-Salem </LOCATION>, bringing jobs and prestige back as well. The company has kept its <ORGANIZATION> R.J. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary, the nation's second largest cigarette maker, based here throughout Expectations of any windfalls are tempered because <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> will use unprecedented amounts of borrowed money to acquire RJR. Locals expect belt-tightening measures to enable the company to pay off its massive debt which could include layoffs, even in the hugely profitable tobacco business. `` Some people are going to have greater personal wealth than ever before, and that's balanced by a certain amount of anxiety about where the company's headed and what's going to happen to their careers,'' <PERSON> Nordenholz </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, who is also a managing partner of the investment firm <PERSON> Alex </PERSON>. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> and Sons, said the city could emerge in better shape when the financial smoke clears. `` Tobacco is fairly recession-resistant, as is most of the food business,'' he said. `` Things may be tight for a year, 18 months. But profits have been in the 20 to 25 percent range. ... What are you going to do, lay people off because you're making more money? It does n't work that way.'' <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Weddle </PERSON>, director of <ORGANIZATION> Winston-Salem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said layoffs could actually help his firm lure other industry to the area. A local unemployment rate of about 3 percent has left the area short of skilled labor, he said. `` I am probably one of the few people alive who sees opportunity in employment reductions,'' he said. Many local shareholders may seek to spend some of their sudden windfall, business owners said. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said other shareholders are looking to reinvest their profits. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> <PERSON> Spache </PERSON>, a maintenance technician at <ORGANIZATION> R.J. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION>, said he sold some of his stock earlier at $ 84 a share, far below the buyout's $ 109 value but way above the stock's price of roughly $ 56 before the bidding war began Oct. 20. The stock fell $ 1.25 Thursday to close at $ 91.75 and dropped another 75 cents this morning to $ 91. `` I just wanted to be on the safe side,'' he said. `` I did n't want everything I had in speculation.

 A recently sluggish Wall Street received a burst of energy from the record bidding contest for <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, and it's bracing for even more takeover activity before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> reconvenes next year. `` The takeover activity has lent a real spark of life to a market which otherwise would be in the doldrums,'' said <PERSON> A.C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, director of equity research at <ORGANIZATION> Argus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION>. `` There's been a lot of things going on here, but there's nothing nearly as big,'' said <PERSON> Eldon </PERSON> <PERSON> Grimm </PERSON>, a senior vice president at <ORGANIZATION> Birr </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wilson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, who has been trading stock for nearly 60 years. `` It's livened up the place. Still reeling from the October 1987 stock market crash and worried about higher interest rates, a sluggish economy and the dollar, many investors had shied away from stocks in recent weeks. But their interest was revived when the <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> bidding war erupted in late October, amid a wave of other multibillion-dollar takeover attempts of big companies. Late Wednesday, buyout specialist <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roberts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> emerged the apparent victor in the bidding war, when the company's board of directors accepted its $ 24.53 billion offer over a slightly larger proposal by <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> management Some of the biggest winners so far are <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> stockholders, who have seen their shares more than double in value from a year ago, from $ 43 to $ 91 at mid-morning today. They stand to reap tens of billions of dollars in profits once the $ 109-a-share merger is consummated. Then there are the investment bankers, such as <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Salomon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, whose business had slowed since last year's stock market crash. They will receive substantial fees for helping the <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> bidders put their proposals together. And there are lucrative fees for the commercial banks lending money to finance the deal and for the battery of lawyers providing contractual advice. The new owners and their investors also are likely to reap big profits once the consumer products giant is restructured. Among the losers have been holders of <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 5 billion in corporate bonds, which slipped 20 percent in market value during recent weeks. What troubles bondholders is that the buyout will be financed primarily by borrowed money, mainly through new issues of high-yield, high-risk `` junk bonds,'' that will give the company higher levels of debt than traditionaly have been considered prudent. Many other outstanding corporate issues have been hurt by the takeover frenzy, but more money has gone into less volatile <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bonds, particularly short-term issues. Other recent big takeover offers include the $ 12.6 billion merger of <ORGANIZATION> Kraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> with <ORGANIZATION> Phillip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cos. </ORGANIZATION>, and British conglomerate <ORGANIZATION> Grand </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 5 billion-plus takeover attempt of <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. The stock of those target companies also has risen in value. <PERSON> Michale </PERSON> <PERSON> Metz </PERSON>, a technical analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Oppenheimer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, and other analysts predict more giant takeovers offers may surface before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> reconvenes next year and considers how to limit buyouts, as many lawmakers have threatened to do. `` I think that there is mounting pressure from various circles to curtail activity of this sort. All this money is changing hands ... but in the end we're not becoming any more productive or creative,'' said <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>. `` Until <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> takes action, though, I imagine any company is up for grabs. Under this scenario, share prices of these future targets and others could be driven up even further. And as more and more companies are bought and taken private that will mean less stock available to the public, which also could boost prices. According to Federal Reserve figures, the amount of available stock has shrunk by about $ 75 billion in each of the past two years. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> predicts that by the end of this year another $ 100 billion in equity will be gone, or about 3 percent of the $ 3.3 trillion outstanding. So, where will all this money be reinvested? <PERSON> Metz </PERSON> predicted, `` The old conservative investor will probably be buying <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bills and CDs with it. They're still wary after the 1987 crash. Others will buy more stock and look for more profits.''

 The ex-lover of a man accused of beating to death his illegally adopted daughter testified today that she thought he had `` godlike powers,'' but she also described how he beat her and ruptured her spleen. <PERSON> Hedda </PERSON> <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> said she had been cut off for years from her family and friends and spent most of her time in the apartment she shared with <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>, who is on trial for murdering the 6-year-old girl they called their own.

 Here is a message from President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on the Jewish holiday of Hanukkah, which begins Sunday, as released by the White House Friday: I am pleased to send holiday greetings to the Jewish community during this season of Hanukkah 5749. Of the many messages found in the Hanukkah story, the one that has always inspired me most is this: with a strong faith in the Almighty, nothing is impossible; and without the help of our Creator, we labor in vain. When the <ORGANIZATION> Maccabees </ORGANIZATION> vanquished the Syrians and recaptured the Holy Temple, they found only a small portion of the pure oil needed to light the Menorah and rededicate the sacred place. Men of less faith would have despaired, but the leaders of that time knew that trust in the Almighty would see them through. Their determination was, of course, rewarded; and today, many centuries later, the miracle of the lights is celebrated with undiminished wonder, thanks and joy. This is the last occasion I will have as president to send warm wishes to the Jewish people on a holiday. It is my hope that this festival will renew and strengthen the spirit of Jewish families everywhere, just as it lifts the hearts of all who look to the care and mercy of our eternal Father. May he bless you and grant you his abiding peace.

 Five Cubans with criminal records left the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> today for their homeland in the first deportation of Mariel boat people since Cuban prisoners rioted last year to protest an agreement to return them to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. A <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Marshal's Service airplane, carrying about 50 people, took off from the <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION> airport at 10:55 a.m. Security was tight, with the five Cubans, shackled in handcuffs and guarded by armed agents, led one by one to the plane. They earlier had been taken to the airport from the federal prison at <LOCATION> Talladega </LOCATION>, where they had been held pending a final ruling on deportation. The flight had been scheduled for Thursday, but was delayed when <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> asked for more time to prepare to receive the five, three of whom lost a series of court fights in their effort to avoid going home. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, by a vote of 8-1, today cleared the way for the deportations. Justice <PERSON> Thurgood </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> was the lone vote to grant an emergency request by the three to remain in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. There was no other comment by the justices. On Thursday, <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Justice <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> denied without comment an emergency application from the three for a stay of repatriation. The day before, the 11th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> also had rejected their plea. The other two Cubans ticketed for the return flight did not oppose deportation. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge U.W. <PERSON> Clemon </PERSON> earlier in the week rejected an appeal by the three that he overturn their deportation. <PERSON> Clemon </PERSON> is expected to rule in the next few days in the cases of 10 others, who also have been held at the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correctional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Talladega </LOCATION>, 60 miles east of <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION>. The 15 were among 114 of the Cubans placed at <LOCATION> Talladega </LOCATION> after the prison riots. Last year's uprising by Cuban prisoners at federal lockups in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oakdale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La. </LOCATION>, was sparked by an agreement for some of the 1980 Mariel boatlift people to be returned to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. In 1980, 125,000 people, some of them convicts or mentally ill, sailed illegally from <LOCATION> Mariel </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, to this country. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> began a repatriation program in 1984, and sent back 201 Cubans before <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> stopped the effort in 1985. Last year he agreed to accept 2,746 <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> natives, with the prison riots coming on the heels of that agreement. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> wants to return as many as 2,500 Marielitos either as `` excludable aliens'' or those convicted of serious crimes in this country. Attorneys for the inmates claim they will be persecuted if sent home. The three who were turned down by the courts this week are <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Beitia-Socarraz </PERSON>, 28, who pleaded guilty to second-degree burglary; <PERSON> Onel </PERSON> <PERSON> Calzado-Garlobo </PERSON>, 43, convicted in 1982 of attempted sexual assault charges involving a 13-year-old girl; and <PERSON> Rene </PERSON> <PERSON> Maurin-Oliva </PERSON>, 25, who pleaded guilty to theft and battery.

Embassy Minister <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubio </PERSON> said that <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> for the inauguration of President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON>, was being treated for a high temperature. <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> was in stable condition and had not changed his plans to return to <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> on Saturday as scheduled, <PERSON> Rubio </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Peralta </PERSON> said <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> `` was somewhat ill, he has a temperature, but in general terms he is all right. `` He only has a little temperature, but these are the normal results of chemotherapy ... He's a bit tired and the altitude probably affected him.'' But government sources in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> said the 63-year-old <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> was in `` very grave'' condition today. An operator at the <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> hotel where <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> had been staying said she was under orders not to transfer any press calls to the <LOCATION> Salvadoran </LOCATION> delegation. <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> attended <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON>' inauguration Thursday morning, but did not attend a dinner the new president hosted for visiting Latin American leaders. <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> had until Thursday exhibited in the past two months what doctors called remarkable improvement in his health. They said the spread of the cancer in his liver had been arrested and that other organs had not been affected. When he arrived in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> on Wednesday, he went directly from the airport to the Basilica of <LOCATION> Guadalupe </LOCATION>, the holiest shrine for this country's predominant Roman Catholic population. He told reporters he had thanked the Virgen of <LOCATION> Guadalupe </LOCATION>, to whom the basilica is dedicated, for a recent improvement in health. Since diagnosis of his cancer in early June, <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> had undergone two weeklong treatments of chemotherapy in <ORGANIZATION> Walter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and follow-up applications in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. Doctors had said that, though the liver cancer had been arrested, it will eventually kill <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>. In June, they gave him six-18 months to live. <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>, one of the the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>' staunchest allies in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, assumed power in June 1984. His presidential term ends next year; elections are due in March 1989. He began his political career in 1960 and was a founder of the Salvadoran <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>.

 The penny-stock brokerage firm <PERSON> Blinder </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Robinson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and its founder have been implicated in an alleged stock fraud and international money-laundering scheme, according to court documents. The operation allegedly poured thousands of dollars into penny stocks without reporting the source of the money to federal authorities as required by law, <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> agents in <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nev. </LOCATION>, have testified. The funds were funneled through phony investors and shell companies with no assets to inside investors of penny-stock firms, according to allegations in the documents. The operation reached across the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> and other European countries, according to a court affidavit submitted by <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> agent <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Salisbury </PERSON>. The allegations were outlined in more than 300 pages of documents made public Thursday. The documents, originally sealed by a court order, were unsealed after The <ORGANIZATION> Denver </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> filed suit in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. Federal authorities agreed Thursday to release the documents. <PERSON> Blinder </PERSON>, <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, which has offices nationwide, fought the release and refused repeated requests to comment on the material. `` We wanted it sealed to give us a chance to review what is in there,'' said <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobson </PERSON>, an attorney for <PERSON> Blinder </PERSON>, <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>. `` If there is to be a trial, it should be in a court of law and not in the media.'' The government's allegations were the basis of a four-day search by federal agents beginning Nov. 19 in which virtually all of <PERSON> Blinder </PERSON>, <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>'s books and records were seized from its headquarters in <LOCATION> Englewood </LOCATION>. According to the court documents, the main targets of the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> investigation are <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Kimmes </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>. Beginning in 1985, the two formed `` shell companies,'' with no known assets, and sold the stock to `` straw parties'' _ people who allowed <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kimmes </PERSON> to use their names in transactions although they had no control over the stock, the documents alleged The proceeds from the sales were shipped to <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> and other European countries. The affidavit states that <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON> <PERSON> Blinder </PERSON>, who founded <PERSON> Blinder </PERSON>, <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, and his brother, <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>, are under investigation for aiding and abetting securities fraud. <PERSON> Blinder </PERSON>, <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, whose revenues have dropped 50 percent this year, has begun closing some of its 80 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> branches.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> <PERSON> Tae-woo </PERSON>'s plan to restore credibility in his administration by revamping his <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> and party has snagged in the selection process, officials said Friday. In other developments, the opposition-controlled <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> issued a subpoena Friday ordering former President <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> <PERSON> Doo-hwan </PERSON> to testify for parliamentary inquiries into corruption and irregularities. It was not known if <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> received it. Hundreds of protesters again took to the streets demanding punishment of <PERSON> Chun </PERSON>, who apologized for corruption and repression during his government and went into self-imposed internal exile. Officials in the governing <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> plans to replace several dozen key leaders as quickly as possible in what they say would be the most extensive shake-up since he took office in February. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> has promised to remove the vestiges of the Chun government to help soothe public furor over his repressive rule. But one party source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> was having trouble finding `` fresh and competent faces'' without military background or past service in the Chun government. The president has a limited pool of senior party officials able to take on the responsibilities of a high ranking government job, the sources said. Party infighting has also delayed the new appointments, which originally were to be announced this week, sources said. Among the most significant Cabinet changes would be the replacement of incumbent officials who have military backgrounds with competent civilians. Past authoritarian governments have been dominated by former army generals. Opposition parties have persistently demanded civilian control of the government. <PERSON> Chun </PERSON>, who resigned in February, went into rural exile Nov. 23 after publicly apologizing for corruption, human rights violations and other abuses during his seven years in office. <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> has denied any personal wrongdoing, but a dozen of his associates and family members, including two brothers, have been convicted or charged with taking bribes and embezzling government funds. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> has asked the nation to forgive <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> and promised speedy democratic reforms, which include the govenment shake-up. But <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>'s proposals failed to satisfy dissidents and radical students who have staged demonstrations demanding <PERSON> Chun </PERSON>'s arrest and punishment On Friday about 200 students armed with iron rods and firebombs attacked a building of goverment prosecutors, demanding <PERSON> Chun </PERSON>'s arrest The attack caused no injuries but shattered dozens of windows. Clashes also broke out in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> at <LOCATION> Yonsei </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> National Universities between hundreds of students and riot police. Students hurled scores of firebombs, shouting `` Arrest <PERSON> Chun </PERSON> <PERSON> Doo-hwan </PERSON>, Punish <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> Tae-woo!'' No injuries were reported.

<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Defense Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> said Friday a new push to get <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> allies to shoulder more of the defense burden should stall any efforts in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to withdraw <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> troops from <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. He praised defense ministers at a two-day meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> for taking the `` remarkable step'' of approving a report critical of some for not doing more for the Western alliance. `` They unanimously approved a report that makes clear that some of their nations are not bearing a fair share of the common defense burden,'' <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> told a news conference. The 79-page report made public Thursday was <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s effort to defuse the potentially divisive issue of `` burden-sharing.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> congressional critics contend the allies are not pulling their weight in <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>. Some have raised the possibility the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> might withdraw some of its 326,000 troops stationed in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Manfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Woerner </PERSON>, a former West German defense minister, told reporters the study sent a signal that `` this is not a matter of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> versus the rest of the alliance. This is a joint alliance effort.'' <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> said the work must continue. `` As long as Cognress perceives we are dealing with this issue fairly, there will not be efforts per se to reduce our troop strength in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` We must remember we are not in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> as a philanthropic gesture to the Europeans,'' he said. `` We are there because of our collective security.'' <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> also said his recommendation for a 2 percent increase, after adjustment for inflation, in the 1990 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> defense budget would allow for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops to remain in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. If <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> pressed for zero-growth budgets for the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>, he said, $ 116 billion would have to be sliced from spending over five years. In a final statement, the ministers said they were encouraged by signs of change in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> since they could lead to `` improved and progressively more stable East-West relations.'' But the ministers's statement added: `` We have, as yet, seen no evidence of relaxation in the scale of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s military effort.'' <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, it said, earmarks about 15 percent to 17 percent of its total economic output for defense spending, nearly three times the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> level. The ministers also said they agreed to provide additional money in the 1991 and 1992 <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> budgets to relocate the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>' 401st <ORGANIZATION> Tactical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fighter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wing </ORGANIZATION> from <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> The move is expected to cost about $ 800 million. <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> has said the 72 F-16 fighter jets must leave its territory by 1991 as part of a drive to reduce the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military presence there. Ministers from 15 of <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>'s 16 member nations met at headquarters in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> as part of the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Planning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> does not belong to the committee. Foreign ministers from all 16 nations gather in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> late next week for a regularly scheduled meeting.

 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, conceding he had hoped to be `` here in another capacity,'' today made his first trip to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> since losing the presidential election, visiting Democratic leaders before meeting with President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. He said he felt no bitterness from the campaign, remarking before his <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> meeting with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, `` When it's all over, we do n't throw bombs at each other; we sit down with each other. After arriving in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> this morning, the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor headed immediately to the Capitol for separate meetings with <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and new <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> was proud of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. `` He fought a good fight,'' the speaker said, adding that the party still considered <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> among its leaders. `` He's young. He's vigorous. He has a lot to offer the country,'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> told reporters before a private meeting with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. `` His future is not behind him, it is ahead of him.'' The governor thanked <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> but added: `` I think in the long run I'll probably emerge stronger but I'd be less than candid if I did n't say I wish I was here in another capacity.'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, too, referred to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as `` a national leader of our party.'' Asked if he considered himself the party's national leader, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> smiled and said, `` We have a good, strong <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> with lots of leaders.'' During his meeting with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, he said, he planned to raise most of the issues that he spoke about during the campaign. `` Education is important; the environment is important; child care is important, good health care is important. These are the things we believe in very strongly,'' he said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> dodged a question about whether he would run for national office again, saying only that he was busy catching up on gubernatorial duties. He also met with <PERSON> Massachusetts </PERSON> <PERSON> Sens </PERSON>. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON> and had lunch with <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, who was the No. 2 man on the defeated Democratic ticket. Some leading Democrats have privately _ and occasionally publicly _ criticized <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and his campaign operation. But <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said he expected <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> to play `` a very major role'' in the party. Aides said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> also would meet briefly with Washington-based campaign aides to thank them for their help. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said he hoped to discuss a broad range of issues with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in `` a spirit of partnership, cooperation.'' The meeting of the former presidential rivals, which was requested by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, came a day after the president-elect met with <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> and two days after he had lunch with <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, one of the men <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> bested to win the Democratic nomination. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, at a Thursday news conference in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, had little to say about his meeting with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> but did say he and other Democrats stood ready to support any `` real efforts'' by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to reduce the federal budget deficit. Since the election <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has expressed concern over reports quoting <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> transition aides as saying Medicare and other entitlement programs could face spending cuts as part of a deficit-reduction plan.

<HEAD>Official Press Credits Walesa with Conciliatory Tone</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WARSAW, Poland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> newspaper on Friday gave <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> credit for being conciliatory during his TV debate with an official union leader, but it said the Solidarity leader usually takes a different tone. The 43-minute debate Wednesday night with official unions' chief <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Miodowicz </PERSON> was the first time <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> had appeared on Polish television in five years, and the first time he was ever given such a forum to discuss his views at length. Supporters believed <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> took the offensive and won the debate easily, but the official press continued to avoid any judgments on who was the victor. <PERSON> Miodowicz </PERSON>, in an interview published Friday with the <ORGANIZATION> Flag </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Youth </ORGANIZATION> newspaper, said in answer to a question about why he did not speak more aggressively that, `` The idea of this meeting was to get closer, not confrontation. As the host, I felt obliged to make my style of the debate conform to this.'' `` We did not indulge in a verbal fight which would bring disgrace on ourselves,'' he said. `` What matters in the end is the future of Polish trade unions and not who won more points.'' He also said he would support a proposal made by <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> during the debate for further televised debates between experts on various problems from both the official unions and representatives of opposing viewpoints. `` I propose twice a month discussions about the problems of workers,'' he said. Meanwhile, the party newspaper <PERSON> Trybuna </PERSON> <PERSON> Ludu </PERSON> said the fact that the debate could be televised in itself proved that authorities are not `` marking time'' in making reforms. `` One should note with appreciation and even satisfaction that <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>'s address contained several statements and theses in a conciliatory tone,'' said a <ORGANIZATION> Trybuna </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ludu </ORGANIZATION> political commentator. `` By rejecting anarchy or destruction and stating that the territory of an enterprise should not be an arena for political struggle, <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> presented himself in a different way that in other times,'' said commentator <PERSON> Ryszard </PERSON> <PERSON> Drecki </PERSON>. `` Millions of Poles on Wednesday listened to a <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> who was rather conciliatory, calm and leaning toward agreement. Not many people know however the speech he delivered last Sunday, an address unequivocally confrontational. Did some change occur in his views in three days?'' The official press had criticized hostile remarks attacking <PERSON> Miodowicz </PERSON> allegedly made by <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> on Sunday, but <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> has denied making the quoted statements. The official <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> news agency later conceded some of its quotations of <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> were erroneous, and issued a retraction.

 A man who stabbed his heroin-addict son to death was acquitted of murder and manslaughter Friday. A jury took 40 minutes to find <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Albertina </PERSON> innocent in the killing of his 21-year-old son, <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON>, on March 11. <PERSON> Albertina </PERSON>, 51, hugged weeping family members at the end of the three-day trial. He told the court he acted in self-defense after his son came at him with a wrench during a family fight. Since becoming a heroin addict, the youth sometimes attacked his family. He broke a sister's jaw, broke another sister's fingers and was arrested for threatening to kill them, the court heard. On the night of his death, he flew into a rage after his father told him, `` I do n't hate you, I despise you.'' The young man was stabbed as he and his father wrestled.

 Five armed Soviets who hijacked a busload of school-children in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and released them in exchange for a plane out of the country surrendered today after landing in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> with a hostage crew. The Ilyushin-76 plane landed at <LOCATION> Ben-Gurion </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> at 5:45 p.m. -LRB- 10:45 a.m. EST -RRB-. <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> radio said the plane was allowed to land after officials received a request from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. `` It's all over,'' an army spokesman told reporters about 10 minutes after eight people were seen leaving the aircraft. There was no word on whether the eight crew members who were freed had been injured during the ordeal. Army officials said that shortly after the plane landed, two men and a woman came out of the plane and asked for a translator. They then began negotiations in which the hijackers surrendered a gun. The standoff ended a short time later. State-run <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> said the hijackers, who were described as four Russians and an Armenian with criminal backgrounds, had large sums of money with them. The five had hijacked a school bus with 30 children aboard in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and traded their hostages for the plane and about 2 million rubles -LRB- about $ 3.3 million -RRB- worth of ransom, said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s chief of staff, Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Shomron </PERSON> One of the Soviet crew members, flight engineer <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> Yermilov </PERSON>, said the five `` wanted to fly out of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. That's why they kidnapped the bus with the children.'' Transportation Minister <PERSON> Chaim </PERSON> <PERSON> Korfu </PERSON> told reporters the Soviets had requested extradition of the hijackers. `` We know there are no children aboard,'' <PERSON> Korfu </PERSON> said. `` There are five hijackers, four men and a woman, and eight crew members.'' <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> radio said there had been constant contacts between Israeli and Soviet airport officials and some diplomatic contacts as well. It said the hijackers had not asked to land specifically in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> but only included it on a list of possible destinations. Reporters were kept in the terminal building and could only see the movements of vehicles on the darkened runway once the plane landed. Earlier, radio monitors said that <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>'s control tower had contacted the hijacked plane. `` Can I talk with the hijacker?'' a controller asked. `` No,'' the pilot responded. <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> radio said the plane at first headed toward <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, but then changed course and flew toward <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, an official said the incident began Thursday in the city of <LOCATION> Ordzhonikidze </LOCATION> in southern <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION>. `` A group of armed bandits hijacked a bus with 30 school-children and a teacher and demanded a plane to deliver them abroad,'' <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Vlasov </PERSON>, head of the Soviet news agency <ORGANIZATION> Novosti </ORGANIZATION>, told a news conference. `` In order to save the children and the teacher a decision was made to give a plane,'' <PERSON> Vlasov </PERSON> said. He said the hostages were released unharmed. In a later report, the Soviet news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said the hijackers included four men and one woman armed with three pistols and an automatic rifle. The hijackers `` demanded a huge sum of money and an airliner for a flight out of the country,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. The bus was taken to the airport in <LOCATION> Ordzhonikidze </LOCATION>, but the hijackers could not find a big enough plane there so they took the bus and hostages to neighboring <LOCATION> Mineralniye </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vodi </LOCATION>, where they boarded the plane, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. It was not clear from the report whether the children were taken onto the aircraft and then released, or whether they were freed as the hijackers got onto the plane. <PERSON> Vlasov </PERSON> said the hijackers wanted to go to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. The last reported hijacking in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> occurred in March, when members of a family musical group from <LOCATION> Irkutsk </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION> hid guns and explosives inside their instruments and seized an <ORGANIZATION> Aeroflot </ORGANIZATION> jet en route to <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION>. The plane landed near <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> after the pilot said he was running low on fuel. An army assault team stormed the plane, and the hijackers opened fire and set off a bomb. Five of the hijackers died. Three passengers and a flight attendant also were killed.

<HEAD>Agency Says It Destroyed 60 Percent of Marijuana in National
Forests</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LES BLUMENTHAL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Federal agents eradicated roughly 60 percent of the marijuana grown in national forests during 1988, while sharply increasing the number of cultivation arrests and plant seizures, a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> official said Friday. At the same time, the number of physical assaults against agents and members of the public in cases related to marijuana growing was down, but the number of sites that were booby-trapped were up, according to <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> figures. The statistics also indicate that growers now apparently are concentrating their efforts on more potent forms of marijuana, such as sinsemilla, and on hybrids that produce more pounds of saleable marijuana per plant. The crackdown on drug growers in the forests has become one of the agency's top priorities, and agents are armed with increased enforcement powers and more money than in the past. `` In essence, 1988 is the first full year in which we have been able to see the sucess of our efforts,'' said <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Few </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>'s assistant branch chief for law enforcement. `` We now have policies and strategies in operation to attack this problem.'' Few said federal agents wiped out an estimated 60 percent of the marijuana grown in national forests in 1988, compared with an estimated 40 percent of the crop in 1987. He said agents and rangers seized more than 340,000 plants in 1988, compared with 255,000 plants in 1987. The estimated street value of the plants seized in 1988 was more than $ 1.2 billion, said Few, adding that the <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> considered that a `` conservative estimate.'' Few said the agency was `` comfortable'' with it estimates, which are based on intelligence from field agents and surveys of marijuana plantations that were harvested before being detected. `` It would be nice to get 100 percent'' of the crop, Few said, `` but we would be foolish to predict that. The objective is to seize enough so that is becomes apparent to the grower that it is not cost-effective for them to use national forest lands.'' Few said that while once agents used to find plantations with 4,000 or 5,000 plants in a forest clearing, most sites now contain about 100 plants that are growing near other trees or brush. The number of marijuana-growing arrests made by the <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> was up almost 400 percent, from 134 nationwide in 1987 to 527 this year, Few said. `` We've dealt with the problem to some extent over the past 10 years handling it as a misdemeanor crime and concentrating on eradication,'' Few said. `` The 1986 drug act gave us the tools we needed to do the job.'' Drug growers now face felony charges and agents now are allowed to pursue suspects even after they leave federal lands. This year also was the first year in which the <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> received the funds for drug enforcement progams it had requested, a total of $ 3.2 million, Few said. The number of physical assaults on agents or members of the general public using national forests dropped from 19 in 1987 to 11 in 1988, while the number of sites found with `` potentially lethal'' booby-traps grew from 83 in 1987 to 116 in 1988. Few said there was a `` dramatic'' increase in the number of marijuana plantations found that exclusively contained the more potent sinsemilla plants, with 1,255 such sites found in 1987 and 2,268 such sites found this year. He said the street value of sinsemilla can be almost twice that of less potent types.

 A homeless man was arrested today for arson, and police said he was a suspect in at least one of 10 fires that broke out in an inner-city neighborhood overnight, destroying eight buildings. Tips from witnesses led to the arrest of <PERSON> Booker </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, 46, who was picked up in the neighborhood while attempting to drink from a container of gasoline, said police spokeswoman <PERSON> Yvonne </PERSON> <PERSON> Bechet </PERSON>. He was booked with simple arson and taken to Charity Hospital for observation. `` He was one of the city's homeless, living in an abandoned car,'' said <PERSON> Bechet </PERSON>. No one was injured in the fires, which occurred mainly in vacant residences. A passer-by said he pulled two elderly women from what was believed to be the only occupied building. Eight buildings were destroyed, and at least six others were heavily damaged. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> was booked for a one-alarm fire that broke out just before 8 p.m. Thursday, about the same time most of the city's firefighters were working on a six-alarm blaze that razed much of a nearby city block, said Fire Department spokesman <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitman </PERSON> Police and fire officials said <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> may be linked to the other fires also. Fire Superintendent <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> McCrossen </PERSON> said there was `` no doubt in my mind'' that the blazes were arson. Police said a witness reported seeing a man running with a gasoline can just as the flames started leaping from the first fire, which swept through six houses on one street. Two more fires engulfed an abandoned bar and a vacant house, respectively, and seven more broke out over the next few hours, all but one within three or four blocks of the first fires, <PERSON> Whitman </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Dandey </PERSON> said he was in a nearby restaurant when some children told him there were people in one of the burning buildings. `` I smelled smoke and I ran out and there were two young kids saying, ` Fire! Fire!' So then, we go over the house and tried to kick the door down. After I kicked the door down, they had two old ladies in the house and I pulled them out,'' <PERSON> Dandey </PERSON> said.

 Atlantis and its crew of five military astronauts rocketed into orbit today on a secret mission that reportedly will deploy a powerful radar satellite to spy on the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and guide the new stealth bomber. The shuttle blasted away from its seaside launch pad at 9:30:34 a.m. EST _ with less than 90 seconds to go in the launch window _ after a blacked-out countdown that was delayed by the same weather worries that had forced a postponement on Thursday. The spaceship etched a fiery path in the sky as it headed straight up on a northward path _ a course that will allow the $ 500 million satellite it releases to fly over 80 percent of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> on its intelligence-gathering mission. `` A very clean ascent for Atlantis; there were no problems encountered on the way to orbit,'' said <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Welch </PERSON>, the commentator at <ORGANIZATION> Mission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. An hour later, <PERSON> Welch </PERSON> reported `` the vehicle is in very clean shape. There are no systems problems whatever to report.'' With those words, the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> clamped a security lid on the flight, cutting off the normal <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> commentary on the mission and the broadcast of crew-to-ground conversations. Only two further announcements were planned during the flight. The first, about four hours after launch, was a brief report that `` the crew of <LOCATION> Atlantis </LOCATION> is go for orbit operations. All crew members are doing well and all systems of the orbiter are performing satisfactorily.'' The second announcement will be an alert that <ORGANIZATION> Atlantis </ORGANIZATION> will land exactly 24 hours later at <ORGANIZATION> Edwards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>. The flight is expected to last three or four days. <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Aldridge </PERSON>, who observed the liftoff from the control center, thanked the launch team, saying `` the payload was extremely important and you did a great job all around.'' Added <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> Administrator <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fletcher </PERSON>: `` You gave us some heart failure there toward the end, but we got it off ... my thanks for another great job.'' Atlantis' liftoff on the 27th shuttle flight and the third all-military mission was witnessed by a smaller-than-usual crowd of a few thousand space enthusiasts along nearby rivers and roadsides. The launch had been delayed 24 hours by strong winds along the shuttle's flight path. Strong, shifting winds five miles up also threatened today's liftoff, but weather balloon data read late in the countdown showed they were acceptable. New doubts cropped up even at the 31-second mark, when <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> again stopped the clock briefly because of concern about weather at a trans-Atlantic landing site in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> had said the launch could occur in a period starting at 6:32 a.m. and ending at 9:32 a.m. Two minutes, eight seconds after liftoff, the flight passed a critical milestone when the two solid fuel booster rockets burned out and jettisoned on schedule, falling into the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION>. The failure of a booster rocket joint led to the destruction of Challenger and loss of its seven-person crew on Jan. 28, 1986. With the boosters gone, Atlantis' three liquid-fuel main engines burned for an additional 6 -LCB- minutes and propelled the ship into an orbit more than 100 miles high. The astronauts, who boarded the spacecraft about 5 a.m., spent 4 -LCB- hours lying on their backs in their bulky escape suits awaiting the decision that finally sent them aloft. <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> meteorologists were watching an area between 25,000 feet and 28,000 feet where there were shear winds of varying speeds and directions that could break up the shuttle as it roared upward toward orbit. `` The speed of the wind is not as much a factor as their direction and the shuttle's direction of flight,'' <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> commentator <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> said. The fueling of Atlantis was halted for about an hour at 12:30 a.m. while a minor leak was fixed on an oxygen tank on a `` fuel farm'' near the pad. Had today's launch been postponed, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> would probably have waited until Sunday to try again. Policy forbids putting work crews through the grueling launch schedule three days in a row. The crew commander, <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Cmdr. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON>, is no stranger to launch postponements. As commander of <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> on the 24th shuttle mission in 1986, he experienced a record seven postponements and had to board the ship six times before finally lifting off. The other crew members are <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Lt. Col. <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON>, the pilot; Col. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mullane </PERSON> and Lt. Col. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Cmdr. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shepherd </PERSON>. Sources who spoke on condition of anonymity say the crew will release a giant 18-ton satellite named Lacrosse that is capable of gathering extremely sharp radar images of military targets in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The information should help <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence officials verify Soviet compliance with arms control treaties and serve as a `` radar eye'' for the new B2 stealth bomber, the sources said. Defense officials contend the secrecy is necessary to make it more difficult for Soviet satellites and spy ships off the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> coast to monitor the flight and learn its purpose. However, the Soviets, have indicated through the official news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> thrst post-Challenger flight.

 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> shook hands with defeated Democratic rival <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> today as the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor arrived for a private fence-mending session that the president-elect had suggested. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had no words for the throng of reporters on hand before going into the vice president's residence at the <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Observatory </ORGANIZATION>. A minute later, Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, the future occupant of the house, emerged and left in his limousine, presumably after greeting <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> inside. Earlier, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> warmly greeted onetime Republican rival <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> at the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, hailing the way ex-political foes can be post-election friends and accepting <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s praise for Cabinet appointments so far. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> turned aside questions about further appointments in a less cheerful manner, criticizing `` early, premature needless speculation.'' He also met with <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Swan </PERSON>, the premier of <LOCATION> Bermuda </LOCATION>, and was to meet this evening with another foreign leader, Argentine President <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON>, in whose country military units were reported to have mutinied today at a large army base outside the capital of <LOCATION> Buenos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aires </LOCATION>. Swan and <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> are the fourth and fifth heads of state meeting with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> since his election Nov. 8. At the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> told reporters he gave <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> a private message from the foreign minister of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. `` The time has come to recognize that the South African government needs a little encouragement,'' said <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, who returned last week from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. He is a longtime critic of sanctions against that nation's white-ruled apartheid government. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told him he would like to see <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and other American black leaders visit <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> `` and explore firsthand what's happening because there have been some significant changes over the last 10 years.'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> cited the government's movement of <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> from prison to a halfway house, the commutation of the death sentences of the <ORGANIZATION> Sharpeville </ORGANIZATION> 6 and other steps. `` They have broken down a great deal of institutionalized and social apartheid and I think it would be nice to just say, ` You're on the right track and we'd like to encourage you a little bit,'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who was not available to reporters after the <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> meeting, also was hosting 20 evangelical leaders at his home Friday night. Before the meeting with <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was asked if he had a place in his Cabinet for the television evangelist. `` Just good friend,'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> interjected. `` Some people do n't understand the campaign,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` They think that when you run against someone in a campaign that that injures friendship. ... It's wonderful the way the American politcal system works.'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> told <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> that in the transition period he had `` played it as well as you possibly could. ... I think it's an extraordinarily competent Cabinet so far.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> declined to say when he would appoint his defense secretary or other top officials. `` The more I answer your questions on the subject that needs to be treated in an orderly, procedural fashion, the more I add to that which I do n't like which is a lot of early, premature, needless speculation, and so I'm not going to do it,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told reporters. `` We are way ahead of where other presidents-elect have been and I'm going to stay ahead. And so all I say is stay tuned and please do n't press me,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. He paid tribute to retiring Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, another erstwhile rival, at a dinner Thursday night. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who reviled <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> during the campaign as `` another liberal governor coming out of nowhere who will take us back to the bad old days,'' made clear immediately after the election that he hoped to bury the hatchet as quickly as possible. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, for his part, had spoken during the campaign of sleaze among top <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration officials, drawing strong retorts from <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> after saying, `` There's an old <LOCATION> Greek </LOCATION> saying ... ` The fish rots from the head first.''' <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> spokesman, said the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor planned to raise with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> a number of the issues he campaigned on. `` Education, health care, day care, drugs, housing and other issues that he felt were important during the campaign and still feels are important,'' <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON> said. In a meeting Thursday, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, that he will take the lead in proposing a solution to the budget deficit, as Democrats have insisted. `` That is exactly what I intend to do'' after Jan. 20, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also said he wo n't be rushed into making Cabinet appointments despite persistent news media speculation that may be troubling to prospects such as <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tower </PERSON>, the former <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> senator keeping a long vigil for the Pentagon opening.

<HEAD>Little Bit of Pesticide Residue Not Hazardous, FDA Chief Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Pesticide residues in food do not pose a health hazard, even though more than 3 percent of the food tested by the government had illegal amounts or types of pesticides, the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> said Friday. `` Many seem to believe that we are consuming large and harmful amounts of pesticide residues,'' <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> Commissioner <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said in a statement. `` That's a myth, and another myth is that any residue, no matter how little or how legal is harmful.'' However, a report by the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s Office of Inspector General said the government system to assure that meat is free of dangerous chemicals has broken down. Predictable inspections and ineffective follow-up methods hamper federal efforts to detect chemical contamination, trace it back to its source and determine if violations are continuing, acording to the report, a copy of which was obtained by the <ORGANIZATION> Des </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Moines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Register </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> said Friday that less than 1 percent of the fresh foods tested show more pesticides than allowed by federal guidelines. An additional 3 percent had illegal pesticide residues, which the agency called `` technical violations, such as an otherwise approved pesticide residue being found on the ` wrong' crop.'' `` The actual residues found are almost always much lower than the tolerances allow,'' <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said. `` Furthermore, residues usually will disappear or decrease during processing, washing and cooking.''

 Here are economic reports Friday by the government:

<BYLINE>UNEMPLOYMENT</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 The nation's civilian unemployment rate in November edged upward from a 14-year low to 5.4 percent despite an increase of 463,000 new jobs and a record percentage of the population at work. The 0.1 percentage point increase from October's rate of 5.3 percent was due almost entirely to a 560,000 increase in the civilian labor force _ people holding jobs or looking for them. Despite the slight increase in the unemployment rate, 116 million Americans held jobs last month, or 62.6 percent of the adult population age 16 or over.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>HOME SALES</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Sales of new, single-family homes rose 3.5 percent in October to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 733,000 units, the highest level in more than 1 -LCB- years. It followed a drop of 1.4 percent in September, revised up from a previous estimate of minus 7.8 percent and a gain of 2.1 percent in August. Sales for the first 10 months of 1988 are 0.4 percent higher than for the 1987 period, suprising analysts who were expecting a decline this year. The average price fell 2.1 percent to $ 140,100 after an identical increase a month earlier.

<BYLINE>FACTORY ORDERS</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 New orders to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> factories for manufactured goods rose $ 3.5 billion, or 1.6 percent, in October to a seasonally adjusted $ 226.2 billion on the strength of big gains in orders for military ships and tanks. Military orders shot up 42.5 percent to $ 10.6 billion after falling 7.0 percent in September. The key category of non-defense capital goods, considered a good barometer of industry investment plans, fell 3.0 percent to $ 33.8 billion, following a large 10.2 percent drop in September.

 ` Tis is better to give than to receive, especially if what you give is a fruitcake. An <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> survey about Christmas gifts found that the fruitcake was chosen most often from a list of `` worst'' holiday gifts. It even finished ahead of `` no gift at all,'' the second choice. Fruitcake was picked as the worst gift by 31 percent, `` no gift'' by 18 percent. Anything that has to be assembled was third on the list of bad ideas, followed by damaged gifts, another tie or blouse, and a gift that needs batteries but does n't come with them. The same survey asked people what they would do with a bad gift. Thirty percent said they would hide it in the closet, 21 percent said they would return it, and 19 percent said they would give it away. Nine percent specified they would give it to someone else as a gift, suggesting the Christmas fruitcake might get recycled as a gift for the host of a New Year's party. The survey was conducted this fall By <ORGANIZATION> R.H. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bruskin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>, which questioned 1,000 men and women nationwide, age 18 or older.

 The decision by Soviet authorities to permit armed hijackers to fly out of the country Friday marked a sharp reversal from the two previous known air piracies, both of which ended in fatal shootouts. But the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>'s statement that the decision was made `` to save the children'' was consistent with Soviet tradition and policy that focuses considerable official attention on the care and upbringing of the nation's young. The five hijackers seized a busload of children in the city of <LOCATION> Ordzhonikidze </LOCATION> in southern <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION>, then traded the hostages for a plane out of the country. They surrendered after landing in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> with a hostage crew of eight. Before <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> rose to power in March 1985, incidents such as hijackings rarely were mentioned by the tightly controlled official press. The labor newspaper Trud reported in July that there have been more than 50 attempted hijackings in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in the past 15 years. Few of them were reported by the Soviet media. In March, an 11-member family musical troupe from <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION> seized an <ORGANIZATION> Aeroflot </ORGANIZATION> jet in March with 76 passengers aboard over the Urals and demanded to be flown to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. According to published reports, authorities ordered the plane to land at a small airstrip near <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION>, tricking the hijackers into thinking they were landing in nearby <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION>. The hijackers shot a stewardess when they realized they had been duped, the reports said, and after two hours of negotiations, a police assault team stormed the plane, prompting the hijackers to detonate a bomb that destroyed the aircraft. Nine people, including five of the hijackers, three passengers and the stewardess, were killed. Nineteen people were seriously wounded. The other reported incident took place Sept. 20, 1986, in the <LOCATION> Ural </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Ufa </LOCATION>, when armed members of the internal security forces hijacked an airliner. Media reports at the time said five people, including two hijackers, were killed when authorities stormed the plane. The other perpetrators were tried and sentenced, the report said, but few details were provided. Air piracy is a capital offense in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. In one of the best known cases, Soviet authorities arrested 26 people in connection with an abortive attempt on June 17, 1970, by 11 Soviet Jews to board and hijack an aircraft in <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> to fly to <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>. Several of those arrested were refuseniks, or Jews who have been refused permission to emigrate. The 26 were convicted in four separate trials. Two were sentenced to death, with their sentences later commuted, and the rest received lengthy prison terms. The same year two Soviet planes were hijacked to <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> in separate incidents. In 1977, two were commandeered and forced to fly to <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>. Four unsuccessful attempts to hijack Soviet airliners were reported between 1961 and 1966.

 Police answering a report that a man was holding his girlfriend hostage mistakenly surrounded the house next door, then shooed the man away when he tried to surrender, police and witnesses said. `` I did n't know what was coming down,'' said the man, <PERSON> Jessie </PERSON> <PERSON> Cobb </PERSON>, 37. `` I came out and they started cussing me and told me to go back inside. I thought they were going to pull a ` Rambo' on me.'' Both he and his girlfriend, <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaines </PERSON>, said later that the incident was an argument that had been blown out of proportion. She denied that she told police by telephone that <PERSON> Cobb </PERSON> had a knife, as police said later. No arrests were made. Police were called to the house Wednesday by a neighbor who said <PERSON> Cobb </PERSON> was holding Ms. <PERSON> Gaines </PERSON> there against her will. But because of a mixup, the police Special Operations Team surrounded the house next door. When <PERSON> Cobb </PERSON> tried to surrender, officers frantically waived him back inside, thinking he was just a curious neighbor and telling him he was in danger. Police Sgt. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowman </PERSON> said the confusion intensified when Ms. <PERSON> Gaines </PERSON> told hostage negotiators by telephone that she could hear officers knocking on the door. `` She apparently was hearing the officers' rather heavy-handed knocking on the house next door, but our negotiators did n't know that,'' <PERSON> Bowman </PERSON> said. A witness, <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, said he tried to tell police they were at the wrong house, but officers told him they knew what they were doing. `` This old boy in the meantime had come out two or three times to give himself up, and the tactical squad ran him back in the house, saying he could get hurt,'' <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bowman </PERSON> said officers were embarrassed by the incident, but officers handled the situation the best way they could with the information available. `` You can armchair quarterback this thing to death. It happened, and the comic overtones are not unknown to us,'' <PERSON> Bowman </PERSON> said. At any rate, he said, no one got hurt.

 Soviet troops broke up a mob of up to 1,500 people that had gathered in the <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> capital of <LOCATION> Baku </LOCATION> to attack Armenians, official media reported Friday. The Soviet government formed a commission to feed and clothe thousands of refugees from the republics of <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> who had crowded into tents, dormitories and relatives' apartments because of ethnic violence that has killed at least 60 people since February. <LOCATION> Baku </LOCATION> radio, in a report monitored by the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, said soldiers had prevented a mob from attacking Armenian residents of <LOCATION> Baku </LOCATION> on Thursday night. `` In the area of the railway station, a mob of up to 1,500 people attempted to beat up citizens of Armenian nationality. Because of the measures adopted, the troops stopped the attempts at hooligan activities,'' the radio said. Soldiers fired warning shots in five instances overnight, and they confiscated nine guns and two knives, it said. A curfew remained in effect in <LOCATION> Baku </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> and other major cities in the two republics. At least 80,000 people have crossed the border to their ethnic homelands, Soviet media reported Thursday. The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Krasnaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zvezda </ORGANIZATION> reported Friday that another 19,000 people had fled across the border the previous day. In a report from northern <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>, the newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> said a resort designed for 300 children and 150 adults was jammed with 700 people who had fled <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>. `` In tents intended for two people, there are six beds,'' the newspaper said. `` In corridors, halls and entrances, endlessly tired people sit silently, immersed in themselves.'' `` Dozens of people who we listened to here said the same thing: there, where they lived, local authorities warned that they could not answer for their safety, and proposed that they urgently leave the republic.'' `` There was no talk about compensation for their homes, cattle, furniture or belongings,'' the paper said. The <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency said that <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> Shcherbina </PERSON>, deputy premier, would head a Soviet government commission to extend aid to the refugees. <PERSON> Scherbina </PERSON> also headed a special commission 2 -LCB- years ago to deal with the <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION> nuclear power accident. Refugees `` will be provided with food, housing, medical and other social and consumer services, and given jobs,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> previously had set up such commissions on a local level. Official Armenian media have said that the government is confiscating empty homes to house the refugees and is providing food for them. The two southern Soviet republics are locked in a bitter dispute over control of the predominantly Armenian region of <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>. Residents began agitating in February for annexation by <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>, but the idea has been rejected both by <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> and the central government in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. Ethnic rioting broke out in the Azerbaijani city of <LOCATION> Sumgait </LOCATION> at the end of February, and 32 people died. The republics remained tense since then, and in mid-November Azerbaijanis began mass demonstrations to protest what they said was an Armenian effort to send settlers to <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> to pad the Armenian majority. A national <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman told the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> newspaper Pravda in an article published Thursday that the death toll in the latest violence was 28. The Supreme Soviet parliament and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> leadership under President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> appealed for calm Thursday, urging Armenians and Azerbaijanis to show restraint.

<TEXT>
 The government released a black newspaper editor Friday after two years of detention without charge, but it banned him from journalistic or anti-government activity. Also on Friday, the government reportedly freed the head of a banned black educational group, and an anti-apartheid newspaper was back in print after a four-week ban. The newspaper editor, <PERSON> Zwelakhe </PERSON> <PERSON> Sisulu </PERSON>, was the best known of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s thousands of emergency detainees and there had been an international campaign urging his release. He is editor of New Nation, an outspoken anti-apartheid newspaper, and had been a Nieman Fellow at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>. `` Amongst other things, I ca n't go back to the paper,'' were the only words <PERSON> Sisulu </PERSON> uttered as newsmen swarmed around him outside <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Prison </LOCATION> in the black township of Diepkloof. Later, he appeared briefly at a packed news conference, but was advised to leave by his attorney, because the restrictions placed on him bar him from talking to the news media and attending a gathering of more than 10 people. Late Friday, police banned a rally planned Sunday in a <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION> church to celebrate the freedom of <PERSON> Zeph </PERSON> <PERSON> Mothopeng </PERSON>, the leader of the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> Pan-Africanist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> who was released from prison Nov. 26 on humanitarian grounds because of his illness. Major leaders against apartheid, the government's system of racial separation, had been scheduled to speak. <PERSON> Sisulu </PERSON>, 37, rejoins his wife and two young children in the black township of <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION> outside <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Sisulu </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Priscilla </PERSON> <PERSON> Jana </PERSON>, said he is barred from writing for any publication, leaving the <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> area, participating in any activity in which the government is criticized, talking to the news media, or going to any school. He is also required to report to police twice a day and be in his home at night, <PERSON> Jana </PERSON> said. `` This is the harshest -LRB- restriction -RRB- order so far under the emergency regulations,'' <PERSON> Jana </PERSON> said. `` It seems he can do virtually nothing. He is imprisoned in his own house.'' Lt. <PERSON> Peet </PERSON> <PERSON> Bothma </PERSON> of the Law and <ORGANIZATION> Order </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said several other detainees were to be released Friday but gave no details. <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Molobi </PERSON>, national coordinator for the banned <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crisis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, was freed, according to his attorney, <PERSON> Azhar </PERSON> <PERSON> Cachalia </PERSON>. The committee sought to increase black control over curriculum and policies in black schools. <PERSON> Molobi </PERSON>, detained for a year, was placed under restrictions similar to <PERSON> Sisulu </PERSON>'s. He can not leave his home from 6 p.m. to 6 a.m., must remain in <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> and is prohibited from participating in activities of major anti-apartheid organizations, <PERSON> Cachalia </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Sisulu </PERSON>'s parents are among the country's best-known activists. His father is <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Sisulu </PERSON>, a jailed leader of the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and a close colleague of <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, who has been moved from a jail to a hospital to recuperate from tuberculosis. <PERSON> Sisulu </PERSON>'s mother, <PERSON> Albertina </PERSON>, a co-president of the banned <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> anti-apartheid coalition, is under government restrictions that prevent her from being quoted or attending gatherings. <PERSON> Sisulu </PERSON>, who will turn 38 on Dec. 17, was hospitalized in June for treatment of depression. The <PERSON> Sisulu </PERSON> family has been awarded the Carter-Menil Human Rights Prize, but it is expected that only <PERSON> Zwelakhe </PERSON>'s exiled older brother and sister will attend the award ceremony in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> on Dec. 10. He has another brother and sister in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, and an adopted brother in prison. Since he was detained in December 1986, <PERSON> Sisulu </PERSON>'s newspaper, published by the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bishop </ORGANIZATION>'s Conference, was banned for three months. Another anti-apartheid newspaper, The Weekly Mail, returned to newsstands Friday after being banned for four weeks as an alleged `` threat to the public.'' It was the third paper that Home Affairs Minister <PERSON> Stoffel </PERSON> <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> has suspended this year under powers granted to him under the 29-month-old state of emergency. Censorship rules under the emergency ban or restrict reporting about unrest, security force actions, treatment of detainees, many forms of peaceful protest and a broad range of statements the government considers subversive. A government official said Friday `` action will be instituted'' against a new Afrikaans-language anti-apartheid weekly, Vrye Weekblad -LRB- Free Weekly -RRB-, because the newspaper has published for a month without registering. <PERSON> Gerrie </PERSON> <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Zyl </PERSON>, director-general of the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION>, said the action would be taken against the paper `` to ensure good order.'' The government had ordered the paper to pay a $ 13,000 deposit for a registration certificate.

 Southern Californians just suffered through one of the worst smog seasons of the decade, air quality officials said.

 New home sales in October jumped to the highest level since February 1987, the government said Friday, suprising analysts who have been expecting rising interest rates this year to dampen sales. In a joint release, the departments of Commerce and of Housing and <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> said sales increased to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 733,000 units, the highest level in 20 months. Adding to the robust picture, the government sharply revised its September figure to a 1.4 percent drop, up from the previously estimated minus 7.8 percent. Last year, most economists were expecting 1988 sales to be lower as interest rates rose. However, sales in the first 10 months of the year are a slight 0.2 percent higher than the same period last year. Fixed-rate mortgages did rise from March through mid-August, but eased until early November before starting to climb again. Adjustable-rate mortgages, however, have risen steadily since the spring and now are nearly as high as before the October 1987 stock market crash. This week, the average rate, excluding add-on fees known as points, was 10.44 percent for fixed-rate loans and 8.26 percent for the most popular type of one-year adjustable rate mortgages, those with caps on how high the interest can go, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. Both were slightly higher than a week earlier. `` I think this is probably about as good as it gets,'' <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Carliner </PERSON>, an economist with the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Builders </ORGANIZATION>, said of the sales rate. `` We have seen interest rates rising over the past few weeks and the rate of economic growth is likely to slow somewhat.'' <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Peach </PERSON>, an economist with the <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, attributed this year's unexpected strength in the housing market to the willingness of home purchasers to use either fixed - or adjustable-rate mortgages, depending on which was the better deal `` Consumers have switched back and forth ... such that the weighted average for mortgage rates has held steady at about 9.5 percent since the beginning of 1987,'' he said. By region, sales rose 14.6 percent in the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION> to an annual rate of 110,000 units, 8.1 percent in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> to a 107,000 unit rate and 5.1 percent in the West to 266,000. In the South, sales fell 3.9 percent to an annual rate of 249,000. The rate in the West, boosted by strong population growth in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, has not been higher since March 1979, when 279,000 homes were sold. For the year, sales in the West are running about 12 percent higher. They're holding steady in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> and South. In the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION>, they're running about 9 percent lower, which economists attribute to high prices. The median price of new homes nationally fell 0.9 percent in October to $ 115,900, meaning half sold for more and half for less. That followed a 6.4 percent increase in September. The average price, which is pulled up by very expensive homes, fell 2.1 percent to $ 140,100 after an identical increase a month earlier. The median was 8.8 percent higher than a year ago, while the average was 11.4 percent more.

 Orders to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> factories for manufactured goods increased 1.6 percent in October, driven by a surge in spending for military equipment, the government said Friday. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said orders for durable and non-durable goods climbed to a seasonally adjusted $ 226.2 billion, following a 1.9 percent decline in September. Defense spending shot up 42.5 percent to $ 10.6 billion, on the strength of orders for ships and tanks, after falling 7.0 percent in September. `` The military sector just went through the roof with the opening of the new fiscal year,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyss </PERSON>, an economist with <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a forecasting firm in <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. `` The generals had money in their checking accounts again, so they were busy writing checks.'' However, <PERSON> Wyss </PERSON> said even excluding defense orders, manufacturing remains strong. He pointed to the backlog of unfilled orders, which jumped 0.8 percent in October, 0.3 percent in September and 1.2 percent in August. `` We're still getting more orders in than we're shipping goods out,'' he said. New orders for the first 10 months of this year are up 9.3 percent from a year ago, compared with a 6.6 percent increase between the same periods in 1987 and 1986. However, the key category of non-defense capital goods, considered a good barometer of industry investment plans, fell 3.0 percent to $ 33.8 billion, following a large 10.2 percent drop in September. Earlier in the year, this sector provided much of the momentum for economic growth as industries geared up to meet an export boom fueled by the lower value of the dollar abroad. `` It looks to me like the investment boom has gone past its peak, and that's bad news. We really need new investment, and having it fall off is a problem,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Brusca </PERSON>, an economist with <ORGANIZATION> Nikko </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. October orders followed a pattern set over the last several months in which the presence or absence of big transportation and military orders influenced overall Transportation spending, bolstered by motor vehicle manufacturing in addition to tank and shipbuilding, jumped 8.5 percent in October to $ 34.3 billion after a decline of 8.9 percent in September. Excluding the transportation category, orders rose 0.4 percent in October and fell 0.7 percent in September. Minus defense, orders edged up 0.2 percent in October after dropping 1.7 percent in September. Orders for all durable goods, `` big ticket'' items expected to last three or more years, rose 2.3 percent in October to $ 122.1 billion after a 2.8 percent drop in September. Meanwhile, orders for non-durable goods climbed 0.8 percent in October to $ 104.2 billion after an identical drop of 0.8 a month earlier. Chemicals accounted for most of the increase, although most industries were up. <PERSON> Wyss </PERSON> said the vigor in the non-durable industries, which were having capacity problems early in the year, could signal renewed price pressures. Shipments of manufactured goods were up by 0.5 percent in October to $ 222.5 billion.

 Salvadoran President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON> <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>, who is suffering from liver cancer, was hospitalized with an intestinal infection, the <LOCATION> Mexican </LOCATION> foreign minister said Friday. `` He's doing very, very well,'' said <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Acevedo </PERSON> <PERSON> Peralta </PERSON>, the foreign minister. `` He had a minor intestinal infection but it's been overcome. <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>, 63, attended the inauguration of President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON> on Thursday. He was taken to the hospital with a temperature about 6 p.m., <PERSON> Acevedo </PERSON> <PERSON> Peralta </PERSON> said. `` He had an exhausting day'' meeting with Presidents <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Vinicio </PERSON> <PERSON> Cerezo </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> in addition to <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON>, <PERSON> Acevedo </PERSON> <PERSON> Peralta </PERSON> said. Asked if the problem was the the intestinal malady that afflicts tourists in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, he replied, `` That's it in part, the change in diet and the work.'' `` The president's condition is delicate,'' he said. `` It's better to have him here -LRB- in the hospital -RRB- 48 hours. You know you have to take care of any infection.'' <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> probably would return to his hotel Saturday, he said, and is expected to return to <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> on Sunday or Monday. In <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, Vice-President <PERSON> Rodolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Castillo </PERSON> <PERSON> Claramount </PERSON> said he had spoken to <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> by telephone Friday and said the health problem is principally the result of chemotherapy <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> underwent recently. The fever was due to an intestinal infection, inflammation of the colon and slight dehydration, <PERSON> Castillo </PERSON> <PERSON> Claramount </PERSON> said. Doctors have said <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>'s health has improved remarkably in the past two months. The spread of the cancer in his liver has been arrested and other organs have not been affected, they say.

 Pity poor <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION>. He was arrested in <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, sacked in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and 25 red-suited <PERSON> Kris </PERSON> <PERSON> Kringles </PERSON> scared the wits out of children with their chorus of ho-ho-hos. And there are still 22 shopping days left till Christmas. Parents in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> were n't too happy with <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION>, either, after a TV program urged children to hold a phone near the set for tone-activated dialing of calls to the North Pole _ at $ 2 for the first minute and 30 cents thereafter. In <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, a misunderstanding over a bill for $ 360 led to the arrests of two stretch limousines full of Santas who were taking toys to children at hospitals and agencies for the poor. `` We had <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> suits on, no pockets, no money, no checks, no ID,'' said <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Minow </PERSON>, who organized the <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> task force. <PERSON> Minow </PERSON> said he arranged to rent one limo Wednesday and the <ORGANIZATION> AAA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Music </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Limousine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> donated a second but demanded $ 360 for the cars before all the deliveries were made. `` In my 17 years as a policeman, this is the first time I've arrested <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Claus </LOCATION>,'' said burglary detective <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Mallory </PERSON> <PERSON> Minow </PERSON> threatened Thursday to sue `` all those involved trying to stop the good works for the children.'' Limousine company spokesman <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON> declined comment. Newly graduated Santas in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> got some final lessons Wednesday _ including that more is n't always merrier. The 25 red-suited, black-booted <PERSON> Kris </PERSON> <PERSON> Kringles </PERSON> invaded a downtown hotel lobby expecting cheers and laughter. But the sight of so many of them at once brought out tears, and children ran to their mothers. `` I really love kids, but I did n't realize they'd be so scared,'' said <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, 19, of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>. `` I reached out to shake one's hand and she started crying. Veteran Santa <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Utecht </PERSON>, 68, with 48 years behind the beard, used the incident to teach the new dogs old tricks. `` Do n't reach down to the little ones from above or they'll retreat,'' he said `` If you stoop to their level, you can win them over.'' <PERSON> Utecht </PERSON>'s basic rules for Santas: Know all the reindeers' names. Do n't make any specific promises. And gently hold the child's hand _ it's soothing and keeps the little dickens from grabbing the beard. He might have added one: Do n't make it too easy to call the North Pole. Only 10 minutes into a half-hour TV program called `` Here Comes Santa,'' angry parents began calling KTZZ-TV in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> on Thursday complaining that their children were urged to hold the phone near the TV set. Electronic tones automatically dialed a call to <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Claus </LOCATION>. After receiving the calls from parents, program director <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Lutgen </PERSON> ordered that the words `` ask your parents'' be shown continuously. Under the station's contract, the production company, <ORGANIZATION> Phone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Quest </ORGANIZATION>, must reimburse parents for calls made without their permission, <PERSON> Lutgen </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernstrom </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> US </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION>, the local phone company, said she could not release figures on the number of calls placed during the program. <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> also was the at the center of a storm in <LOCATION> Carson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION> threatened a boycott of a Carson shopping mall where an employee allegedly made a racist remark about a black <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Claus </LOCATION>. The protest was sparked by the firing of <PERSON> Rodney </PERSON> <PERSON> Newton </PERSON> as the mall's <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Claus </LOCATION> and a remark a mall official allegedly made to him that `` there is no such thing as a black <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Claus </LOCATION>,'' according to <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>.

Mall owner <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> McGaughey </PERSON> had said race was not a factor, noting a second black <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> was quickly hired. <PERSON> Newton </PERSON> was fired because he was too big for a disappearing act in a holiday program stunt, <PERSON> McGaughey </PERSON> said.

 Deciding that free coffee was not much of a threat to the public, the county health board has pulled the plug on a brewing controversy by waiving a rule that even the city council was violating. Few people knew it, but under the law, every business or organization that gave out coffee or soft drinks to the public was required to buy a $ 50 food-service permit. That meant all those doctors' offices, beauty shops, auto-repair businesses and even the City Council, which handed coffee out free, were in violation. This week, the <ORGANIZATION> Pueblo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> voted to waive the required license. Businesses that otherwise are not in the food business are free to offer coffee, soft drinks or wrapped pastries to their customers. `` We're trying to enforce the intent of the law, not necessarily the letter of the law,'' said health division chief <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Stasiak </PERSON>. `` The intent is to protect the public's health, and coffee has not proven to be a significant problem.'' `` It's such a burden off my mind,'' joked <PERSON> Merle </PERSON> <PERSON> Souder </PERSON>, manager of a Meineke discount muffler shop, after the vote was take. <PERSON> Souder </PERSON> said he does n't keep the coffee pot in a public area of his store, `` but that's not to say some of our regular customers do n't head straight for the coffee pot.''

<TEXT>
 The country's top trade official said Friday that he has the blessing of President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for a tough <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> stance on `` agricultural disarmament'' of price supports at an upcoming round of major international bargaining. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Trade Representative <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said he had met Thursday with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> at the White House `` and they have assured us of their support of our objectives and for our strategy in <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION>.'' The <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> talks, beginning Monday, will draw nearly 100 nations for a mid-term review of the four-year <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION> Round of trade negotiations. <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> spoke at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> just hours before leaving for <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION>, where trade ministers will conduct the most wide-ranging negotiations ever held to liberalize and regulate international commerce. <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON>, an agricultural economist who said he would be returning to work in the private sector once <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> takes office in January, adopted a tough negotiating stand in advance of the talks. `` We are willing to leave <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> without'' any agreement in the 15 categories on the agenda, he said. `` If agreement comes at the price of sacrificing basic principles, we will not pay that price,'' he said in prepared remarks. At the top of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agenda is obtaining a commitment from the participants for the eventual elimination of domestic and export agricultural subsidies, said <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON>. The main opposition comes from the 12-nation <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>, which faces powerful lobbies opposed to reducing farming price supports. <ORGANIZATION> EC </ORGANIZATION> officials have warned in recent days that if the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> continues to insist on its position, the <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION> Round could fail. `` We hope that reason will prevail'' among the Europeans, <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said, because agricultural reform makes too much economic sense to be abandoned. `` It's inevitable,'' he predicted. One argument the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> intends to make is that the elimination of subsidies would create jobs in the European markets which suffer high unemployment, would result in lower food costs and would save billions of dollars in government funding for farmers, he said. A recent study by the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economics </ORGANIZATION> in the Australian capital of <LOCATION> Canberra </LOCATION> says agricultural liberalization would result in 3 million new jobs for Europeans, <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> contends that doing away with government supports would save some 20 to 30 billion dollars annually in its own deficit-ridden budget and help farmers compete on an equal footing on world markets. But agreement on such a move must come from all the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trading partners, <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said. `` No one is going to unilaterally disarm in agriculture,'' he said. `` If there's going to be any disarmament in agriculture it has to be a joint effort.'' If the <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION> round fails to achieve any progress on this by its end in 1990, <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> said, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> may as well enact a farm bill boosting support for farmers. <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> predicted that controversy would also arise in <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> over the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> push to modernize the 40-year-old <ORGANIZATION> GATT </ORGANIZATION> agreement by including in it the booming world trade in services, such as banking and tourism, and providing protection for patents and copyrights. Piracy in this field is costing American entrepreneurs billions of dollars annually in lost revenues. A large bloc of countries in the developing world argues that fledgling service industries would be hurt by the proposed regulations and that copyright protection would greatly increase the costs of such imports as computer software and pharmaceuticals on which they depend heavily.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Friday it has rejected a request from a South Korean legislative committee that top <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomatic and military officials testify in person about their knowledge of any <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> role in a bloody 1980 uprising in that country. Instead, the department will be willing to respond to written questions from the committee, deputy spokeswoman <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> committee had asked that then-U. Ambassador <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Gleysteen </PERSON> and the commander of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces in <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Wickham </PERSON>, testify about their knowledge of the incidents at <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION> when hundreds _ perhaps thousands _ of people were killed in clashes with the South Korean military. Mrs. <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> said the views of <PERSON> Gleysteen </PERSON> and <PERSON> Wickham </PERSON>, both of whom have since ended their service in <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, will be incorporated in the official responses to written questions. Allegations have been made that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> acquiesced in the transfer of Korean troops to <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION> for the purpose of violently suppressing the rebellion. Opposition leader <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Dae-jung </PERSON> has said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> did not do enough to prevent the killings. Mrs. <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> said that after careful consideration, the department determined it would be `` inappropriate'' for <PERSON> Gleysteen </PERSON> and <PERSON> Wickham </PERSON> to testify in person but written responses would be agreed to because the incident at <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION> is a matter of `` great concern'' in <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. In ruling out personal appearances by the two officials, Mrs. <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> said the department `` considered basic principles of international comity and the manner in which foreign relations are conducted.'' `` We also considered principals of immunity of government officials from providing testimony before foreign legislative bodies,'' she said. She added that the department believes it can be fully responsive to the committee's requirements through written answers.

 <PERSON> Benazir </PERSON> <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> took the oath of office Friday as prime minister, assuming the job her father lost in a coup 11 years ago and promising to `` choose the path of law.'' `` Our message is one of hope, peace, liberty and progress,'' Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> told a nationwide televised address after the ceremony. About 300 Pakistani officials, lawmakers and foreign ambassadors attended the 15-minute swearing-in ceremony in the presidency, a flat, modern building between the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> in the federal capital. After reciting the oath, Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> received an extended round of applause that was drowned out when members of her <ORGANIZATION> Pakistan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> rose and cheered `` Bhutto lives! The 35-year-old woman took the office once held by her father, <PERSON> Zulfikar </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>, who was deposed in a 1977 coup by Gen. <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> <PERSON> ul-Haq </PERSON> and hanged two years later. <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> ruled eight years under martial law and three years with a limited civilian government before he died in an Aug. 17 plane crash. A caretaker government resigned earlier Friday. In her television address, Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> promised her <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> `` will choose the path of law, eradicate hunger and poverty, give shelter to the shelterless, employment to the unemployed and we will educate the illiterate. But she painted a bleak economic picture, saying `` our entire fiscal system is nearing bankruptcy. We are faced with the prospect of disaster, but a whole generation is ready to channel everything in the direction of reconstruction.'' Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON> had pledged since her father's death to oust <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> and restore democracy to <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. `` Our struggle has now reached a successful culmination,'' she said. `` The doors of Parliament that were shut are now open.'' Before <PERSON> Zia </PERSON>'s death, elections had been scheduled for Nov. 16. Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Pakistan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> won 105 seats in the 237-seat <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, and she is said to have enough support among minor parties and independents for a majority coalition. An eight-party grouping called the <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>, which includes <PERSON> Zia </PERSON> loyalists, won only 60 seats. Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>'s father, the late <PERSON> Zulfikar </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>, founded the <ORGANIZATION> Pakistan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> that she now leads. `` I feel a mixture of happiness and sadness because I kept thinking about my husband,'' said <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>'s widow, <PERSON> Begum </PERSON> <PERSON> Nusrat </PERSON> <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>, after she watched her daughter officially assume leadership. President <PERSON> Ghulam </PERSON> <PERSON> Ishaq </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> said he had received the resignations of the caretaker government effective Friday. Ms. <PERSON> Bhutto </PERSON>, who studied at <ORGANIZATION> Radcliffe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, and at <ORGANIZATION> Oxford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, wed <LOCATION> Karachi </LOCATION> businessman <PERSON> Asif </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Zardari </PERSON> in a traditional Islamic arranged marriage a year ago. She gave birth to a boy Sept. 21. <PERSON> Zia </PERSON>, <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Raphel </PERSON> and 28 others died in the August crash. Officials said sabotage was the probable cause, but the probe is continuing.

<HEAD>U.S. Ambassador: East Germany Far From Diplomatic Ties With Israel</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> has an `` extremely bad'' human rights record and the <ORGANIZATION> Berlin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wall </ORGANIZATION> continues to bar better trade and diplomatic ties with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, according to the departing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ambassador. Ambassador <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Meehan </PERSON> called <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s claim it is not responsible for <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> crimes `` a bit ridiculous.'' He predicted the communist nation will be slow to establish diplomatic relations with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, despite recent wooing of Jewish leaders. <PERSON> Meehan </PERSON>, 64, spoke in an interview Nov. 22 on condition his name not be used until he left <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> on Dec. 1. He had been posted there since 1985. On prospects for diplomatic ties with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, he said: `` I think they will be the slowest ship in the convoy to <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>,'' although `` there is no question that <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> now wants to make an impact on the world Jewish community.'' <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> have never had diplomatic relations. A procession of Jewish leaders have visited <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> recently and elaborate state-sponsored ceremonies in November marked the 50th anniversary of the start of the Nazi pogrom. `` They know that they have lagged behind in this and that it is important to get the world recognition they want,'' said <PERSON> Meehan </PERSON>. But he said the state's recent official treatment of Jewish issues contrasts starkly to its refusal to accept moral responsibility for the Holocaust. <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> contends it is innocent of Nazi crimes because it was founded in 1949 and because communists also were persecuted. `` This position is a bit ridiculous,'' <PERSON> Meehan </PERSON> said. `` It amounts to saying the place was neutral territory during the war.'' <PERSON> Meehan </PERSON> also noted that overtures to Jews are clouded by the government's crackdown on the <ORGANIZATION> Lutheran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> because it has pushed for dialogue inspired by Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policy of greater openness `` This is where the tolerance ends,'' <PERSON> Meehan </PERSON> said. `` The party leadership is pursuing a needlessly severe attitude.'' Church publications have been censored or seized and human rights activists allied with the church have been detained. `` In all, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> has an extremely bad record in human rights,'' he said. This record and its refusal to pay <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> claims for seized property are main stumbling blocks to better relations with <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, he said. <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s desire for Most-Favored Nation trade status was `` out of the question.'' `` It would be extremely difficult, if not impossible, to try and argue in the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that there was a case for <ORGANIZATION> MFN </ORGANIZATION> for <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> so long as the wall is there and and so long as there are major limitations on freedom of emigration,'' <PERSON> Meehan </PERSON> said. And there would be little growth in trade as long as <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> claims are unresolved. <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> refuses to consider $ 80 million in claims filed by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies and citizens for property lost after the nation was founded. Interest has boosted the sum to $ 300 million. <PERSON> Meehan </PERSON> expected little change in East German leaders' resistance to Soviet-style reforms. `` They do n't quite know what's happening. They do n't know where it's leading and they're very unsure of the whole situation,'' he said. But because <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s economy is strong compared with other <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact countries, it can afford to wait to gauge the outcome of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms, he said.

<HEAD>Gorbachev, Foreign Minister Discuss Summit, Cambodia</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> told <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s foreign minister Friday he sees a basis for beginning the `` concluding stage'' of settling their dispute over <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, and called for direct Chinese-Vietnamese talks on the issue. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> also discussed a likely 1989 Soviet-Chinese summit meeting in the session with Foreign Minister <PERSON> Qian </PERSON> <PERSON> Qichen </PERSON>. It was the first visit of such a high-ranking <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> official to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in 31 years. `` From the Soviet viewpoint there was a basis for bringing the solution of the problem into the concluding stage,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> told Qian, according to the official Soviet news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>. `` As far as we know, a similar constructive spirit marks the stance of the Vietnamese comrades and the leadership of the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kampuchea </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> -RRB-,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said `` A dialogue between <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> could play an important role.'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has made several overtures to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, including an effort to settle the dispute over <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, the most divisive issue that remains between the countries. He urged they continue to improve their relations. `` I think that our vital interests are not contradictory, while cooperation has good chances both from the viewpoint of domestic requirements, the tasks of modernization tackled by the two countries, and from the international viewpoint,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said. `` We are satisfied on the whole with the development of cooperation in various spheres of life,'' he said. `` But we believe that this is only a beginning.'' He called for more scientific, cultural, youth and tourist exchanges. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> wants the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to use its influence to get all Vietnamese soldiers out of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, where they have been fighting a Chinese-backed resistance for the past decade, and the dispute has been the main stumbling block to a Soviet-Chinese summit. Soviet-Chinese relations soured in the early 1960s in a struggle over the direction of the world communist movement. Relations reached a low point in 1969 when they fought a brief frontier war. But <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has ordering a pullout of Soviet troops from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, reducing Soviet troops on the Chinese border, and agreeing to direct talks about the Vietnamese presence in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. Without providing details, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said the discussion also touched on <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and <PERSON> Qian </PERSON> also discussed a likely Chinese-Soviet summit next year. `` It was noted in the conversation that the leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S.S.R. </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> were now considering having a summit meeting. Both sides attach great importance to it,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. The summit is likely to occur in the first half of 1989, with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> traveling to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> because senior <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xioping </PERSON> is 84 and rarely travels abroad.

<HEAD>Soviet-Israel Contacts During Hijack May Spur Improved Ties</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The hijacking of a jetliner by five armed Soviets who surrendered here Friday comes at a time of increasing contacts between <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The cooperation between Israeli and Soviet officials and the fact the hijacking ended without bloodshed could accelerate the process of reconciliation. Some analysts were encouraged by the fact that Soviet authorities asked <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to let the <ORGANIZATION> Aeroflot </ORGANIZATION> jet land, maintained diplomatic contacts throughout the day, and sent the head of their mission in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to observe events at <LOCATION> Ben-Gurion </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>. `` This can only be seen as an improvement in relations and an important step forward for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s ... standing with the Soviets,'' said <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Friedgut </PERSON>, a professor of Soviet politics at <ORGANIZATION> Hebrew </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` In the past, the Soviets would never have considered giving the plane authority to come to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Perhaps they wanted to signal that they're ready to trust <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> with something serious ... It could be a step toward normal relations,'' <PERSON> Friedgut </PERSON> said in an interview. A Foreign Ministry official also welcomed the cooperation but was more restrained in his optimism. `` Of course everybody will be very happy if this ends in good cooperation between the two countries,'' the official said on condition of anonymity. `` I would n't say it should be regarded as a breakthrough. But yes, you may say it shows the Soviets at least have the minimum confidence that things will be handled properly here,'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> indicated <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> would react positively to a Soviet request for extradition. `` The moment we get a request, we will examine it. I do n't see any reason why we would want to hold them,'' said spokesman <PERSON> Alon </PERSON> <PERSON> Liel </PERSON>. The Soviets broke diplomatic ties with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> after the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war when the Jewish state seized the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Golan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heights </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> allies. A gradual thaw in relations began in July 1987 when the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> sent a quasi-permanent consular delegation to <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> responded by sending a delegation to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in April. This year the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> met a key Israeli demand by permitting a growing number of Jews to leave the country. The year's exodus of 16,572 Jews through November is more than double last year's outflow of 8,011. The 1988 emigration figure is expected to be the highest in eight years. The warming of ties also has extended to the Soviet-allied Eastern bloc, all of whose members severed ties with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in 1967 except <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>. In September, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> announced it was renewing full diplomatic ties after a 21-year break. The announcement followed visits to <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> by Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> and Foreign Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>. Cultural ties have also been improving. Moments after the hijackers surrendered, <PERSON> Yevgeny </PERSON> <PERSON> Yevtushenko </PERSON>, a 55-year-old Soviet poet, landed in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> for a series of poetry readings in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> and other <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> towns. `` It is such an unhappy incident, but I am landing here completely voluntarily,'' <PERSON> Yevtushenko </PERSON> joked on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> televison.

<HEAD>Percentage of Americans Working Hit Record High in November</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MATT YANCEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Labor Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 With 463,000 new payroll jobs indicating a continuing booming economy, the percentage of Americans at work reached an all-time high in November despite a slight increase in the unemployment rate, the government said Friday. The job growth was twice what economists had anticipated and nearly double the 238,000 increase in new jobs in October. But a 560,000 person increase in the civilian labor force _ those holding or seeking jobs _ raised the unemployment rate from a 14-year low of 5.3 percent in October to 5.4 percent last month, the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said. `` Whenever we have strong employment growth, we usually bring more people into the labor force,'' Labor Statistics Commissioner <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Norwood </PERSON> said. She added that she expects the 560,000 figure _ the biggest one-month increase since June 1986 _ to be revised downward later when the government has more data. The labor force has been growing at a monthly rate of less than 200,000 over the past year, with 100,000 fewer teen-agers seeking jobs in 1988 than in 1987. That trend is expected to continue until 1994 when the offspring of the post-World War II Baby Boom generation begin reaching employment age in greater numbers, <PERSON> Norwood </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Despite the slight increase in the unemployment rate, the government figures showed 116 million Americans holding jobs last month, or 62.6 percent of the adult population age 16 or over. Both are record highs. The November job gains were widespread, including virtually every industry except for oil and gas drilling and department stores. `` It's quite clear that department stores are building up for the Christmas holiday at a much slower rate than previously,'' <PERSON> Norwood </PERSON> said. Of the 463,000 new payroll jobs in November, factory jobs rose by 71,000 on top of a four-year record-high 99,000 new assembly line workers in October. Manufacturing employment is now 425,000 above what it was a year ago. Nearly one-fourth of the factory job gains have been in machinery, indicating that the nation's economic growth is being spurred as much by exports as increased consumer spending. Meanwhile, factory workers continued to average four hours of overtime a week last month. `` That suggests we're going to have even more employment gains in the next few months,'' said <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinai </PERSON>, chief economist for the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a financial consulting house. Construction employment increased by 55,000 in November, reflecting an upturn in housing starts after sluggish activity from July through October, as well as unusually warm weather for the month. In a separate report, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said new home sales rose 3.5 percent in October to their highest level in more than a year. Factory orders also rose 1.6 percent in October, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said in another report, largely on military buying. However, orders for non-defense capital goods _ a key barometer of businessmen's expectations of the economy _ declined for the second consecutive month. `` Before an election people tend to push off capital expenditures as long as there is some uncertainty ... and there has been some talk of a recession,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Renfro </PERSON>, an analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Alphametrics </ORGANIZATION>, a <PERSON> Bala </PERSON> <PERSON> Cynwyd </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, forecasting firm. `` Come midwinter or early spring there might be some big increases.'' The employment gains sent bond prices down among traders fearing an inflation from an overheating economy. Earlier this week, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> released a survey by its 12 banks declaring that the economy was slowing. However, analysts both inside and out of the government said the November employment figures indicate another month of strong growth just like October. `` This many jobs would n't be showing up unless the economy was very strong,'' <PERSON> Sinai </PERSON> said. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s strategy of small doses of interest rate hikes since last March to slow it down clearly has not worked. The economy is moving ahead at a rate close to 4 percent, while its -LRB- non-inflationary -RRB- potential is only 2.4 percent.'' <PERSON> Renfro </PERSON> disagreed with the perception that continuing large job gains every month is a sign that the economy is overheating. `` That would be true if consumers were trying to purchase more goods than are being produced,'' he said. `` But it looks like the growth is coming from exports, and that's good news.'' The fear among analysts since early 1987 when unemployment rates began falling into the range of 6 percent was that tighter job markets would begin pushing wages up faster than prices, setting off a wage-price spiral. But there was no evidence of that last month, with the average wage among production workers unchanged from the $ 9.45 in October and only 3.3 percent above what it was a year ago. Consumer prices, meanwhile, have climbed at an annual rate of 4.6 percent so far this year. `` One month's figures ca n't be taken too seriously,'' said <PERSON> Sinai </PERSON>. `` If you look over the past three months, it shows earnings rising at 4.5 percent annually.'' The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, in its final economic forecast, last month predicted that inflation will slow to 3.7 percent next year, with a decrease in unemployment to an average 5.2 percent on economic growth of 3.5 percent. <PERSON> Norwood </PERSON> said accomplishing all three simultaneously will be `` very, very difficult'' but she did not rule out the possibility that it can happen. `` The labor force is growing by half the rate it was in the 1970s, so it's going to be somewhat easier to maintain lower unemployment levels,'' she said. `` And at the moment, there is not much upward pressure -LRB- on inflation -RRB- from wages.''

 A mail carrier making his rounds heard a scream and rescued a blind woman and her guide dog who had fallen into a 9-foot-deep hole. `` I feel he was really my angel for Christmas,'' <PERSON> Connie </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelley </PERSON> said after her rescue Thursday. `` Probably he will have an extra present under his Christmas tree this year.'' <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Grothe </PERSON>, 37, a four-year employee with the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, said he was delivering mail when he heard Ms. <PERSON> Kelley </PERSON> scream. He found her and her guide dog, Dazzle, trapped in a hole which was dug by workers repairing a water line. `` I could n't reach her,'' <PERSON> Grothe </PERSON> said. `` I had to jump in. ... I picked her up, walked to the edge, pushed her out and her dog, then got out myself.'' `` Being a mailman, I'm a little cautious with dogs, and this dog was really wonderful,'' <PERSON> Grothe </PERSON> said. Ms. <PERSON> Kelley </PERSON>, 29, said she was going shopping when she fell into the hole _ and through no fault of the guide dog. `` My dog was hesitant at first, and I made her go forward,'' she said. `` She saw the hole up ahead I did n't know was there.'' As the dog tried to squeeze her between the hole and a ladder, Ms. <PERSON> Kelley </PERSON>'s foot slipped and she fell in, dragging Dazzle with her. She said she was trapped in there three to five minutes before <PERSON> Grothe </PERSON> found her. `` I think if I had been there any longer I would n't have had the strength to get out of there with help,'' she said. <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Michaud </PERSON>, chief inspector for utility connections for the city of <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>, said employees of <PERSON> Pete </PERSON>'s Water and Sewer had neglected to put guard rails around the hole and had left it unattended. He said he had reprimanded the owner, <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Skjod </PERSON>, but lacked the power to issue a citation. <PERSON> Skjod </PERSON> said his workers told him they had left the site to get some parts and that they had put up a small barricade, enough to warn away a sighted person. `` It's a lesson to be learned,'' he said. `` From now on, when we do jobs we'll have sightless people in mind, and I thank God nothing serious happened.'' He said he called Ms. <PERSON> Kelley </PERSON> and visited her home after hearing about the accident.

Still, he received warm welcomes from <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leaders on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> during a morning full of meetings before going to the home of the man who defeated him, President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, for a private visit. `` When it's all over, we do n't throw bombs at each other; we sit down with each other,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said before his session with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. Afterward, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had few kind personal words for his bitter election rival but promised to cooperate with the new administration, provided <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> works to cut the federal deficit without turning his back on health care, day care, education and other issues that the Democrat focused on during his campaign. `` Do I look bitter?'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> asked in response to a question after a 35-minute meeting with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` I feel pretty good actually.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said the meeting did not include any talk about the tone of the campaign, which <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> criticized at the time. `` That's over now and our job is to meet some very formidable problems,'' he said. But he managed to work in a swipe at <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration deficit spending and warned <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> against continuing such policies. Asked if he now considered himself a friend of the president-elect, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> at first laughed and then said: `` I'm anxious to cooperate and play a constructive role. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, in brief comments to reporters, said he looked forward to working with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and other governors. `` To you and <PERSON> Kitty </PERSON> and that wonderful family, <PERSON> God </PERSON> bless you and have a great Christmas,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told the departing <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> also had a brief encounter with Vice President-elect <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, who was at the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> residence when <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> arrived. `` We shook hands and greeted each other,'' said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who during the campaign scornfully referred to the <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> senator in nearly every speech. The trip to the nation's capital was far different from the last time <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> came, near the end of the campaign, when he still had Secret Service protection and was accompanied by a phalanx of aides. This time he took a commercial flight, accompanied by only two aides, and traveled around town in a crowded rental car. He met with Washington-based campaign workers before heading home to <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had lunch <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, who was the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential nominee, and met separately with congressional leaders including <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, and new <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>. Some party leaders have been highly critical of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and his presidential campaign, but <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said he still had a part to play in party leadership. `` I think it's a very major role,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said. `` We're very proud of <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said at an earlier meeting. `` He fought a good fight.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> dodged questions about whether he would consider running for president again, saying he was too busy catching up on gubernatorial duties to think about his political future. But <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said, `` All of us look to him for leadership, for ideas, for guidance, for cooperation. ... Governor <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is young. His future is not behind him. It is ahead of him. I think he has a lot to give this country.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> thanked the speaker for his praise but did not hide his disappointment in losing the election. `` I think in time I'll probably emerge stronger but I'd be less than candid if I did n't say I wish I was here in another capacity,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, after a separate meeting with his fellow New Englander, also praised <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as `` a national leader of our party.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> promised to maintain a party presence but did not claim to be the Democrats' national leader. `` We have a good strong party, with lots of leaders,'' he said. `` I hope to make a contribution.'' Just a week before the election <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said he had no respect for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> because of the negative tone of the Republican campaign, but on Friday he refused to be drawn into a new battle with his election rival. `` I'm looking ahead; I assume he is,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` The election is over.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> also visited with <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Sens. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON>. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> offered a question for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` The first thing we want to know is whether he still considers <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> a part of the union and we hope to get a positive response,'' the senator said jokingly. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has been dealing with a state financial crisis at home but plans to take a <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> vacation after next week. Spokesman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Dorsey </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had no high-profile appearances planned until February, when he is to return to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for the winter meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governors </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>.

 A letter apparently signed by a kidnapped <ORGANIZATION> Swiss </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> official and released Friday implied he was abducted to be exchanged for a hijacker held in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. A leading cleric, meanwhile, said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was preventing the release of the nine American hostages held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. No group has claimed responsibility for the abduction of <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Winkler </PERSON>, the 32-year-old Swiss <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> delegate seized by three gunmen in the southern port of <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION> Nov. 17. `` I was not kidnapped as a Red Cross delegate but as a Swiss citizen. My government knows what my kidnappers want from it and it has to cooperate in order to save my life,'' said the letter, delivered to a Western news agency. The 56-word letter in English did not include a picture of <PERSON> Winkler </PERSON>, which is the usual method of proving its authenticity, nor did it provide any indication of the kidnappers' identity. Lebanese police theorize <PERSON> Winkler </PERSON> was seized to swap him for Shiite Moslem air pirate <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Hariri </PERSON>. He has been held in <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> for more than 16 months and is scheduled to go on trial Feb. 20. The <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> confirmed the signature was <PERSON> Winkler </PERSON>'s and the Swiss government warned its citizens to avoid all but essential travel to <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. `` It looks very much like blackmail,'' said <PERSON> Edouard </PERSON> <PERSON> Brunner </PERSON>, the No. 2 man in the Swiss Foreign Ministry. Shiite Moslem cleric <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Fadlallah </PERSON> charged Friday that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has complicated the release of Americans held by pro-Iranian factions in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. `` I have information that the Americans are the ones who complicated the issue of the hostages,'' said <PERSON> Fadlallah </PERSON>, who has close ties with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, in an interview with the weekly magazine Ash-Shiraa. `` America is panting after a resumption of ties with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, but it wants ties resumed in a way by which no political concession is made,'' he said. `` <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> rejects a resumption of ties unless <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> changed its hostile policy against <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> as well as some details related to bilateral relations including the frozen Iranian assets and others.'' <PERSON> Fadlallah </PERSON> is the reputed spiritual guide of the Iranian-backed <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or Party of God. <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, made up of <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> zealots loyal to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>, is the umbrella group for pro-Iranian underground factions holding most of the 14 Western hostages. The hostage held longest is American <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, who was kidnapped March 16, 1985. The <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> suspended its <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION> operations _ including services for the handicapped and visiting Palestinians detained in Israeli prisons _ and withdrew the remaining five Swiss delegates. <PERSON> Harari </PERSON>, 22, a member of <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, hijacked an Air Afrique jetliner while on flight from <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> and forced it to land at <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> airport July 24, 1987. He killed a French passenger before he was overpowered and arrested. Also Friday, the mother of 32-year-old Belgian physician <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cools </PERSON> pleaded in a videotaped message for help in finding her son, missing in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> for more than six months. No group has claimed to have kidnapped Cools, missing after leaving his residence in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> refugee camp of <LOCATION> Rashidiyeh </LOCATION> May 21.

<HEAD>Few Blacks Sit-in at White Park, Council Vows Not to Yield</HEAD>

 Black leaders protested Friday in a newly declared `` whites-only'' park, but the ultra-conservative town council vowed to resist mounting pressure to abandon increased segregation. `` We are going to carry out fearlessly the will of the white people,'' <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> official <ORGANIZATION> Koos </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> van </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> der </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Merwe </ORGANIZATION> said at an emotional news conference in <LOCATION> Boksburg </LOCATION>. `` We will never surrender! Never! Never! Never!'' He said Conservatives are establishing a fund to support councilors who become targets of economic sanctions aimed at forcing them to reverse their decision. The Conservatives, who took control of <LOCATION> Boksburg </LOCATION>'s town council in nationwide local elections Oct. 26, called the conference to rebut claims by the governing <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> that three Conservative councilors planned to defect. That would tip the balance of power on the 20-member council and enable the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> faction to allow blacks back to public facilities in the industrial town east of <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>. One by one, the 12 Conservative councilors stood up and pledged their support for their party's policy. One of the resegegrated facilities is the town's 37-acre park, <LOCATION> Boksburg </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION>, where 11 black leaders from neighboring townships staged a peaceful protest. `` <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> belongs to all of us,'' declared <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Boya </PERSON>, head of a national association of black local officials. The protest was billed as a mass sit-in, but the officials said poor organization led to a low turnout. Dozens of reporters, but no police, were on hand. `` Be warned, do not push the patience of the people too far,'' <PERSON> Boya </PERSON> said, asking, `` Where is this beautiful town being led? Is it being pushed to the Stone Age where no black person was supposed to be in town after certain times?'' <LOCATION> Boksburg </LOCATION> was the first of several Conservative-controlled towns to announce resegregation of facilities opened to all races in recent years. The party won control of about 100 towns in October. In some, councilors are considering curfews for blacks. Black residents are boycotting <LOCATION> Boksburg </LOCATION>'s white-owned shops, and sports federations and corporations have threatened to withdraw from towns where resegregation takes place. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which enacted <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s apartheid laws during 40 years in power, has denounced the Conservatives' moves, but has been widely accused of hypocrisy. `` What we are doing is done by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> is every second town,'' <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> der </PERSON> <PERSON> Merwe </PERSON> said. `` They should either stop criticizing us or open all the water fountains, swimming pools, libraries and beaches.'' Early Friday, a bomb exploded outside a tax office in <LOCATION> Boksburg </LOCATION>. Police said no one was injured in the blast, caused by a small limpet mine. There was no indication whether it was connected to the racial controversy.

 Mayor <PERSON> Eberhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Diepgen </PERSON> extolled the discovery of nuclear fission Friday, but said he can not celebrate consequences `` from <LOCATION> Hiroshima </LOCATION> to Chernobyl'' as West Germans marked the 50th anniversary of the breakthrough. Mixed with praise for the scientific leap were words of caution about end results of the revelation in a <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> laboratory by German scientists <PERSON> Otto </PERSON> <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> and <PERSON> Fritz </PERSON> <PERSON> Strassmann </PERSON> in December 1938. `` We can not simply pay respect to the enormous and unexpected satisfaction of the human thirst for knowledge, without at the same time also calling to mind the consequences _ from <LOCATION> Hiroshima </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION>,'' the mayor told 1,100 guests at <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hall </ORGANIZATION>. Other speakers also pointed to the bitter lessons of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bombing of the Japanese cities of <LOCATION> Hiroshima </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nagasaki </LOCATION> in August 1945 and the April 1986 nuclear accident at <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. `` This discovery changed the world like hardly any other one before it, technically and spiritually as well as economically and above all politically,'' <PERSON> Diepgen </PERSON> said. `` Today we recall this great scientific deed, without being able to celebrate,'' said the mayor, a member of Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s conservative <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> party Resistance to nuclear power remains strong among younger West Germans, especially since Chernobyl. The disaster in the Soviet <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION> dumped radioactivity over large parts of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, causing widespread restrictions on sales of fresh meat and produce. West Germans, located at the front line of the <LOCATION> East-West </LOCATION> struggle, also remain wary of nuclear weapons despite the current removal of medium-range <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> rockets from their soil. On Dec. 16, 1938, <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> and <PERSON> Strassmann </PERSON> started their fateful experiment in a laboratory in <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Dahlem </LOCATION> section. It showed that bombarding the uranium atom with neutrons leads to its splitting. At first the pair were unsure of the implications. Then, from her exile in <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, their Jewish colleague <PERSON> Lise </PERSON> <PERSON> Meitner </PERSON> theorized that such a splitting could lead to the release of huge amounts of energy through chain reactions. <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> won the 1944 Nobel Prize in chemistry for the work conducted at the <ORGANIZATION> Kaiser </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wilhelm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemistry </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Speer </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> arms minister, later implied <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> was among German scientists trying to develop the atomic bomb bu many people say <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> dissociated himself from such efforts. During Friday's ceremony, researcher Professor <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Brix </PERSON> said the <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> and <PERSON> Strassmann </PERSON> discovery, besides leading to nuclear power, also brought about advancements in nuclear medicine and even astrophysics. `` On the other side of the coin'' were victims of <LOCATION> Hiroshima </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nagasaki </LOCATION>, nuclear weapons stockpiles and distrust of nuclear power since Chernobyl, he said. `` Many people now have a basic mistrust of science,'' added Brix, who is from <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s prestigious <ORGANIZATION> Max-Planck </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. It organized the formal ceremony with four other scientific research organizations.

 Space shuttle Atlantis lifted off into a windy sky at the last possible minute Friday _ a spectacularly public act to carry into orbit a $ 500 million secret satellite that can pierce darkness or clouds to vastly enhance <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s capacity to spy on the Soviets. Not a word was heard outside the <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> control rooms from commander <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON> or the four other military crewmen who are carrying out the highly classified mission to deploy the 18-ton satellite Lacrosse. <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Aldridge </PERSON>, who observed the liftoff from the control center, thanked the launch team, saying `` let me tell you that you have made a great contribution to the nation's national security. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> waited out the same kind of fierce, high-altitude winds that caused the postponement of the flight Thursday, found a momentary calm, and set Atlantis flying almost straight up on a northward path from the Kennedy Space Center. Liftoff time was exactly 9:30:34 EST _ less than 90 seconds before the end of the three-hour launch opportunity period. `` Very clean, by the numbers,'' is how mission commentator <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Welch </PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION> Mission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> characterized the start of the flight. `` The vehicle is in very clean shape. There are no systems problems whatsoever to report.'' The public communications system, a 24-hour operation on most shuttle flights, fell silent thereafter. Acting on <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> orders, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> planned to break that silence only to say that the astronauts had an OK to proceed with their mission's task and to give 24-hour notice for Atlantis' return. The flight is expected to last three or four days with landing at <ORGANIZATION> Edwards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. The first announcement came four hours into flight, when <ORGANIZATION> Mission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> reported: `` The crew of <LOCATION> Atlantis </LOCATION> is go for orbit operations.'' That meant the ship's cargo bay doors were open and the task of preparing the satellite for deployment could begin. `` All crew members are doing well and all systems of the orbiter are performing satisfactorily,'' <ORGANIZATION> Mission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> said. <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Cmdr. <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON>'s crew is <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Lt. Col. <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON>, the pilot; Col. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mullane </PERSON> and Lt. Col. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Cmdr. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shepherd </PERSON>. The outlines of their mission no longer are a secret _ not even to the Soviets _ but details remain classified. Filling Atlantis' cargo hold is one of the most expensive satellites ever built It is not deterred by clouds or darkness from gathering radar images on the ground below. Atlantis' liftoff on the 27th shuttle flight and the third all-military mission was witnessed by a smaller-than-usual crowd of a few thousand space enthusiasts along nearby rivers and roadsides. It was the third time <ORGANIZATION> Atlantis </ORGANIZATION> had been launched into orbit. The shuttle was in view of the launch site well past the two-minute point when its spent booster rockets fell off. The failure of a booster rocket joint led to the destruction of Challenger and loss of its seven-person crew on Jan. 28, 1986. According to sources who spoke on condition they not be identified, <PERSON> Mullane </PERSON> will use the shuttle's crane to drop the satellite _ one of a series named Lacrosse _ overboard. The satellite's orbit will take it over the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, and the information it gleans should help <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence officials verify Soviet arms control compliance as well as serving as a `` radar eye'' for the new B2 stealth bomber. Defense officials contended the secrecy made it more difficult for Soviet satellites and spy ships off the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> coast to monitor the flight and learn its purpose. According to the official news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>, the Soviets already know much about Lacrosse. Its antenna, sources said, spreads out 150 feet and it has a 100-foot long radar screen. During deployment of the satellite, believed set for Saturday, <PERSON> Mullane </PERSON> reportedly will manipulate the remote robot arm to lift the satellite out of the cargo bay. Shepherd and <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> reportedly will be suited up in the spacecraft airlock, prepared to make a spacewalk if there is a problem with the satellite release. After the Lacrosse is set free, <PERSON> Gibson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON> are to back off several hundred feet and fly formation with the payload until ground controllers are certain it is working properly. If it is not, an effort may be made to retrieve it for return to <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. The sources also report the five crew members will conduct several experiments aimed at defining man's role as a military observer in space, with reconnaissance a high priority. It is believed the astronauts will test a special optical device that resembles hand-held binoculars. The tests will be coordinated with undisclosed ground exercises that could include troop maneuvers, naval movements or ballistic missile launches. The countdown was halted several times during the morning to wait out high-altitude winds up to 126 mph. Starting before dawn, a pilot flew continuously through the launch path and balloons were sent aloft to take readings. Thursday's launch had been scrubbed by strong winds eight miles high and clouds made conditions marginal at best. Friday, by contrast, the sky was brilliantly blue and there was bright sunshine above fleecy clouds. The troublesome winds were five miles up. Toward the end of the 6:32 - to-9 :32 a.m. `` window of opportunity,'' launch control got balloon data that showed The count continued only to be halted again at the 31-second mark, because of concern about weather at a site in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> where the shuttle would have landed in case of emergency. `` You gave us some heart failure there toward the end, but we got it off,'' <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> Administrator <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fletcher </PERSON> told the launch team. `` My thanks for another great job.''

<HEAD>Weinberger Hits Loans to Soviets as Strengthening Military</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Former <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Caspar </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON> on Friday sharply attacked $ 7 billion in European loans to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> as a potential aid to the Soviet military. `` These may be all going into production of better fertilizer,'' he said in a speech to business executives. `` The same chemicals, however, are used for chemical warfare in many cases. The problem is we do n't know. I do n't think we are at the stage where we can trust unquestioningly their pretensions.'' The loans are not linked to particular transactions and have been made in the past two months, he said. He added that the bulk of them are guaranteed by west European governments. In other remarks prepared in advance he called for immediate high-level consultations by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and its allies on issues of economic and financial security. `` I think <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> _ with full <ORGANIZATION> EC </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- and Japanese endorsement _ should incorporate these new issues into plans to bolster alliance defense burden-sharing and ensure that the West does not continue the gratuitous, undisciplined financing of many Soviet activities around the world inimical to vital Western security interests,'' he wrote. He defined burden-sharing as: `` They -LRB- <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s allies -RRB- pay more and we pay less.'' A member of the audience commented that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> grain sales also help the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> by freeing up its resources. `` We're guilty too,'' <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON> replied. `` I'm not criticizing Europeans. I'm criticizing the rush to do this on a rather broad basis and without any attempt to verify what the proceeds are going to be used for.'' In his prepared remarks he pointed to Soviet sales of bonds in the West and the possibility that in time millions of Westerners could wittingly or unwittingly hold such bonds in their own portfolios or through pension funds. `` And, inevitably, soon thereafter, they would be told that that was another reason to grant favors and help that ` nice' Mr. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON> said. He noted reports that billions of Western dollars are on deposit in banks owned by the Soviet bloc. <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON> criticized what he called the growing romance between the 12 governments of the community and the communist bloc. He said businesses owned partly by west Europeans and partly by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> are a rapid way of putting Western know-how into Soviet hands. <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON>, who stepped down as defense secretary in 1987, was speaking at a business managers' conference on plans by the European community governments to dismantle barriers to trade among them by the year 1992. He said greater European unity could help Western defense, for example by promoting standard weapons that could be used by all <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> members.

 <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s remaining challenges to Iran-Contra charges were rejected by a judge Friday, but the major counts against him could still be scuttled by White House refusal to release classified documents. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> rejected defense motions to dismiss charges that the former <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> staff member obstructed congressional investigations of reports he gave covert military assistance to the Contra rebels in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. The decisions were released as <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> took the bench for a third straight day of closed hearings on <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s objections to censoring 395 government documents that independent counsel <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> wants to use as evidence against him. The secret hearings were scheduled to resume Tuesday. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON>'s rulings disposed of the last of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION>'s pre-trial motions. His decisions have upheld 14 of the 16 charges originally brought against North by <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>. But the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's decision not to allow <PERSON> North </PERSON> to use any of the 40,000 pages of secret documents sought as defense evidence poses a serious obstacle to going forward with the major charges against the former presidential aide. About 90 percent of the classified material pertains to the broad conspiracy charge that <PERSON> North </PERSON> and his three co-defendants illegally diverted more than $ 14 million in profits from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arms sales to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> to the Contras. The rest of the material involves 12 other counts, particularly charges that <PERSON> North </PERSON> lied to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and destroyed <ORGANIZATION> NSC </ORGANIZATION> documents to obstruct an inquiry of the Iran-Contra affair. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> has said repeatedly that <PERSON> North </PERSON> should be given wide latitude to introduce secret documents relevant to defending the conspiracy charge and a related count of theft of government property. The judge has threatened to dismiss those charges if secret documents he determines are necessary to <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s defense are not made available by the government for use at a public trial. On Thursday, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> ruled out pardoning <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> but said `` duty requires'' him to withhold secret documents from the trial. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> denied the decision was a back-door maneuver to let North off the hook on the major charges. `` The things we're blocking are the things that duty requires we block,'' he said. <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> contends that <PERSON> North </PERSON> does not need to disclose any secrets to get a fair trial of the charges. He has asked <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> to bar any release by lawyers for the retired <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> lieutenant colonel. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> gave North until Dec. 19 to specify any other secrets he considers important for his defense, including information that might be elicited when high government officials are questioned on the witness stand. The secrets that the administration wo n't release include the existence of covert intelligence operations and the location of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> hostages in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. Disclosure of such information could expose `` people in very difficult situations to torture and death,'' <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said in court last spring at the outset of the case. But the information also includes the well-publicized names of Central American countries that helped assist the Contras as well as nations, such as <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, that were asked to donate money to the rebel cause. The countries were referred to by letter or number during congressional hearings on the Iran-Contra affair, but their names became widely known. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the names of countries were `` one of the minor categories,'' indicating the administration might be more flexible about revealing their identity. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> has repeatedly expressed impatience with the idea of showing jurors documents stripped of references to information that has already leaked into the public domain. In advance of this week's hearings, <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> directed <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> to devise an alternative to referring to the foreign countries by letter, saying `` this masking technique appears unduly cumbersome.'' The defense contends that referring to countries by numbers or letters would create confusion and make it impossible to question witnesses. Defense lawyers also want to disclose secrets to support <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s contention that he destroyed documents to prevent disclosure of covert operations by members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> or other government officials North and his co-defendants _ former national security adviser <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> and arms dealers <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hakin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> _ are to be tried separately.

<TEXT>
 The 60 seniors at <ORGANIZATION> Altamont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> are skipping the annual class trip and donating their trip money to a 6-year-old leukemia victim, who needs $ 100,000 for a bone marrow transplant. The seniors decided to give the $ 3,000 plus other funds they plan to raise to <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Grubaugh </PERSON> after hearing an emotional pitch from <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Ingram </PERSON>, vice president of the local <PERSON> Jaycees </PERSON>, who went into the classrooms to explain the youngster's plight. `` Her speech really got to you. There were a lot of tears,'' said <PERSON> Johanna </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, 17, secretary of the senior class in this central <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> town of 2,400 people. `` She told us that Christmas is a time for giving and what better gift to give.'' After Ms. <PERSON> Ingram </PERSON>'s visit Tuesday, the subject turned to the senior trip, said <PERSON> Matt </PERSON> <PERSON> Sager </PERSON>, 17, the senior class president. Donating money raised for the trip _ the destination had not been decided _ provoked a `` lot of student discussion,'' <PERSON> Sager </PERSON> said, but it was approved by a show of hands. `` There were one or two students who did n't like the idea, but nobody spoke against it,'' he said. The seniors voted to give <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> all the proceeds from a spaghetti supper planned to raise funds for the trip, plus other money set aside for the traditional excursion. Principal <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Logue </PERSON> praised the seniors, noting their action ignited a flurry of fund-raising ideas. `` The school has exploded in the last two days,'' <PERSON> Logue </PERSON> said. Junior class president <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Laatsch </PERSON>, 16, said his class decided to donate money from a dance scheduled for Friday night. And all four classes are competing in a `` Kiss The Pig'' contest _ the teacher, community member and student who collect the most money for the operation get the privilege of kissing a pig at an upcoming basketball game. <PERSON> Craig </PERSON>'s parents, <PERSON> Mike </PERSON>, 35, and <PERSON> Judy </PERSON>, 33, of <LOCATION> Altamont </LOCATION>, said their insurer, <ORGANIZATION> Prudential </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, considers the bone marrow transplant experimental and wo n't pay for it. The Grubaughs say they appreciate the seniors' sacrifice. `` I hate to see the students give up their class trip,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Grubaugh </PERSON>. `` We would like to see them hold the money out of the fund until we get closer to the goal.'' So far, the family has collected $ 16,000. Guidance counselor <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Alst </PERSON> sent letters to parents seeking their approval of the senior class' action. `` This is the kids' money -LRB- for the trip -RRB- but we wanted the parents to be aware of what they had done,'' he said. About half of the parents have returned the letters; all favored the seniors' decision. `` We are a poor community,'' <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Alst </PERSON> said, `` and if we pull it off it will be a miracle. But then we all believe in miracles.''

 Multimillionaire developer <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> will play tour guide during Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s visit to <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>'s upscale retail mall next week, a Trump spokesman said Friday. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Raisa </PERSON>, who will be in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to meet President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, are expected to spend about a half-hour Thursday inside the marble-lined shopping atrium on Fifth Avenue, said <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Klores </PERSON>. Due to security reasons, they may only get to browse through stores on the first of the mall's six levels.

 A historic agreement announced Friday gives <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> power to regulate the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s cleanup of a uranium processing plant that has pumped 300,000 pounds of radioactive waste into the environment. <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> Attorney General <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Celebrezze </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> and Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, said the decree, negotiated by federal and state attorneys, gives the state a court-enforceable order to pressure the department to clean up the plant at an estimated cost of $ 1 billion. The accord covers the Feed Materials Production Center in <LOCATION> Fernald </LOCATION>, which state officials blame for contamination of air and water at the 1,050-acre site 18 miles north of <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>. The plant enriches uranium for nuclear power plants and for the government's nuclear research efforts <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Oak </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ridge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, operations, which include <PERSON> Fernald </PERSON>, said the agreement is evidence of intent to clean up the plant. He said it is not intended as an admission of wrongdoing. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Grone </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> DOE </ORGANIZATION> manager at <LOCATION> Oak </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ridge </LOCATION>, said this week the government will have spent $ 355 million by the end of fiscal 1989 on cleanup and safety at <LOCATION> Fernald </LOCATION>. The plant sits above the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> aquifer, a water source for 2 million people. The Energy Department has admitted that the plant emitted radioactive uranium dust into the atmosphere over three decades. <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> said he hopes the court decree will prompt <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to give high priority to cleanup of 17 Energy Department plants nationwide. <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Chesley </PERSON>, a lawyer for neighbors who have a $ 300 million class-action lawsuit pending against the plant said the settlement does not compensate victims, give <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> authority over radioactive wastes stored at the plant or indicate whether the <ORGANIZATION> DOE </ORGANIZATION> has committed the whole $ 1 billion. <PERSON> Chesley </PERSON> said he also is concerned that in exchange for the agreement, the state agreed not to bring additional civil or criminal lawsuits against the department and past or present plant contractors and officials. He said his group will proceed with its lawsuit at a Dec. 16 hearing here. <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Clawson </PERSON>, a neighbor represented in the lawsuit, said the agreement falls short of what the Energy Department should do. `` It mainly addressed the hazardous-waste problem, not the radioactive waste problem,'' said <PERSON> Clawson </PERSON>, who lives four miles from the plant. `` They've hardly admitted to anything yet.'' The 37-year-old plant processes and molds uranium metal ingots for use elsewhere in the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s production of nuclear weapons. There has been no production at the site since union workers went on strike Oct. 7. Energy Department officials have said they expect production to resume when the strike ends. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Spiegel </PERSON> signed the agreement and also is presiding over the neighbors' lawsuit. The agreement resulted from two years of negotiations prompted by two lawsuits, filed by the state in 1986 and 1987, against the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. The decree requires the department to pay the state about $ 1 million for penalties and to reimburse <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> for overseeing the cleanup, <PERSON> Celebrezze </PERSON> said. He said the agreement requires <PERSON> Fernald </PERSON>'s current operator, <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Materials </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, to pay $ 60,000 in penalties for two releases of radioactive radon gas from concrete silos containing radium wastes. It also requires <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lead </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which operated the plant until the end of 1985, to pay $ 275,000 for past environmental problems. `` The decree also extends <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>'s jurisdiction over <ORGANIZATION> Fernald </ORGANIZATION> to all state and federal hazardous-waste law and regulations,'' <PERSON> Celebrezze </PERSON> said. `` This does n't take away the federal pre-eminence in things nuclear,'' <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> said. `` But it does set a first in what any -LRB- state -RRB- attorney general in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has been able to work out.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is assessing the future of <PERSON> Fernald </PERSON> and other plants nationwide in a secret study to be completed this month. <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Materials </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> announced Thursday it will lay off 350 of the plant's 1,500 employees soon because of declining demand for processed uranium. <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> opposes closing the plant because he thinks the cleanup would get a higher priority if it remains active. <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> said <PERSON> Fernald </PERSON>'s problems date through 35 years of administrations and predecessors to the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, including the <ORGANIZATION> Atomic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> officials on Nov. 22 announced agreement with the DOE on a $ 50 million cleanup of hazardous waste at a uranium enrichment plant near <LOCATION> Piketon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. In that settlement, the department also agreed to be subject to <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> environmental regulation. <PERSON> Celebrezze </PERSON> said the details of the <LOCATION> Piketon </LOCATION> agreement remain to be incorporated into a federal court consent decree. The matter of fines to be paid for pollution vilaations at <LOCATION> Piketon </LOCATION> also is not yet resolved.

 A man accused of beating to death his adopted daughter admitted knocking the 6-year-old girl to the floor the night she was fatally injured, the man's former lover testified Friday. `` I knocked her down and she did n't want to get up again. This staring business had gotten to be too much for me,'' <PERSON> Hedda </PERSON> <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> said <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> told her during a cocaine-smoking session a few hours after the alleged assault. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> said <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> had angrily accused <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> in the past of practicing `` a stare that was supposed to hypnotize the person stared at.'' Ms. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON>, 46, is the key prosecution witness against <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>. The disbarred lawyer is accused of beating <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> on Nov. 1, 1987, six years after she was brought as a newborn to live in their <LOCATION> Greenwich </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION> apartment. She was taken to a hospital the next day and later died of a brain injury. <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> has denied hitting <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON>. On her second day of testimony, Ms. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> said she once viewed <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> as a `` godlike'' figure and tried to protect him when he severely beat and brainwashed her. Ms. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> testified that she was cut off for years from her family and friends. During one period, <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> forbade her from leaving their apartment without permission; she lost her job as an editor at <ORGANIZATION> Random </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> after repeatedly missing work because of black eyes, she testified. `` That was the whole deal. They kept it so secret,'' Ms. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON>'s sister, <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Liebman </PERSON>, 48, said outside the courtroom, explaining that their family had not known the extent of her sister's problems. Ms. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON>'s testimony buttressed the prosecution's claim that she was intimidated, injured and virtually brainwashed by <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>, 47. `` I was extremely attached to him. I thought he was the most wonderful person I'd ever met and basically I worshiped him, literally. -LRB- I -RRB- thought he had supernatural powers ... and healing and a lot of godlike powers,'' she testified. She said she has come to realize through therapy that none of that is true. She has spent the past year in physical and psychological therapy, including several operations. While she had consulted psychiatrists and psychologists, Ms. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> testified that `` <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> basically was acting as my therapist. ... I was very shy and I guess tense and he was trying to make me more spontaneous, more natural, freer.'' The death of little <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> in an affluent, well-educated household shocked many New Yorkers and led to a re-examination of the duty and ability of neighbors, teachers and social workers to recognize and report evidence of child abuse. <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>, charged with second-degree murder, says she fell unconscious after choking on food and that he caused the bruises on her chest and back while trying to revive her. Charges against Ms. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> were dropped. Police also found a 16-month-old boy the couple raised in their apartment. The boy was returned to his natural mother. Asked about her relationship with <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> in late 1983 or early 1984, Ms. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> replied: `` At that time, he began beating me severely.'' Ms. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> said that on Feb. 18, 1985 _ one of six times she tried to leave <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> _ she fled to a women's shelter but was sent to <LOCATION> Bellevue </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>. Asked by doctors what had happened, she concocted two stories to protect <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>: she had fallen down stairs, or she was homeless and had been attacked by men on the street. When doctors pointed out old injuries on her X-rays, she told them she had been a member of a sadomasochistic cult _ `` because I believed it.'' `` He would encourage me to come up with stories, fantasies, about what happened. ... Since I had no actual memories of this myself, I believed that I had some sort of an amnesia about it,'' she said. Once, she asked her father to come get her, but <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> walked in while she was packing and `` he got violent with me. He threw me to the floor. I hurt my leg.'' When her father arrived, she told him everything was fine because `` I was afraid of <PERSON> Joel </PERSON>'s reaction.''

<DATELINE>BRAZZAVILLE, Congo (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> accused each other Friday of delaying the signing of a long-awaited interim peace agreement. But both sides left open the possibility that a dispute over withdrawing 50,000 Cuban troops from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> will be resolved under <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> mediation or will be shelved for later discussions, and that an interim agreement will be signed. The tentative accord provides for the Cuban troop withdrawal and for independence for <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, also known as <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>. South African diplomat <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Babb </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> that the signing was delayed because <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> rejected a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> proposal for monitoring the withdrawal of the Cubans. <PERSON> Babb </PERSON>, deputy director general of foreign affairs, said, however, `` We can perhaps overcome the problem of not having a final verification document but that is still to be discussed here.'' South African Foreign Minister <PERSON> Roelof </PERSON> <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> and Defense Minister <PERSON> Magnus </PERSON> <PERSON> Malan </PERSON> flew to <LOCATION> Brazzaville </LOCATION> on Friday to join the talks. Cuban delegates told reporters <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> insisted it be allowed to join the team monitoring Cuban withdrawal. <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> regards this as unnecessary, saying the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> can monitor the withdrawal and report to <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Chester </PERSON> <PERSON> Crocker </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomat leading the negotiations, has made no comment on the dispute. <PERSON> Crocker </PERSON>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> assistant secretary of state for <LOCATION> African </LOCATION> affairs and architect of the peace plan, has sought to induce <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> to grant independence to <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> by persuading the Cubans to withdraw from Marxist <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, the territory's northern neighbor. Angolan rebels, meanwhile, vowed Friday to continue their 13-year insurgency if the peace talks fail to result in negotiations between the rebels and the Angolan government and a genuine withdrawal of Cuban troops. The pledge by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> for the Total Independence of <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> came in a statement distributed in <LOCATION> Lisbon </LOCATION>, the capital of <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>. The anti-communist guerrilla group has fought the government of President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> dos </PERSON> <PERSON> Santos </PERSON> since losing a civil war after <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> gained independence from <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> in 1975. The guerrilla movement is not party to the talks among <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>.

 A high school class ring torn from the hand of a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> flier killed in a 1944 military plane crash in southern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> has been returned to the flier's family. A man whose stepson found the ring, during a hike last month to the crash site atop <LOCATION> Palomar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> in northern <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, flew to <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> with the ring Thursday. `` After I saw it was a class ring, I knew there would be somebody out there who would dearly love to have it,'' said <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, 54, of <LOCATION> Lakeside </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>. Twelve men, including <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> of St Cloud, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, died in the May 30, 1944, collision between a B-24 bomber and a fighter plane, both part of <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> 9th Patrol, according to records of the <LOCATION> Stearns </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION> -RRB- Historical Society. The ring was from St. Cloud Technical High School, Class of 1942. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> enlisted in November 1942. He was 21 when he died. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> personally delivered the ring to <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s younger brother, <PERSON> Larry </PERSON>. `` I was just afraid it would get lost again,'' <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said, explaining his lengthy trip. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, 54, of <LOCATION> Burnsville </LOCATION>, and his wife, <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON>, 51, greeted <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> at the Minneapolis-St. Paul International Airport `` How he tracked me and my family down was something,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> began a round of calls to the military and news media in an effort to pinpoint the crash date and get a list of victims. Reporter <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> of the St. Cloud Times, contacted by <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, learned from residents of <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s wartime death. <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> confirmed details of the event with <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Lommel </PERSON>, assistant archivist of the <ORGANIZATION> Stearns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Historical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, and then helped <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> get in touch with <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> had the ring carefully polished before giving it to the Bakers. `` It's just as clear as a bell,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. `` Mom and dad did without so we could have rings,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. `` I know it was a sacrifice for my mom and dad, too,'' said <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, who added that he lost his own class ring while he was in the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. The Bakers plan to give the ring to their son, <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON>, 21, who was named after his late uncle. `` He has everything else of his,'' <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Buffalo FBI Agent Infiltrated Sicilian Crime Families</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DARREN DOPP</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The key to an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> sting operation that led to drug trafficking charges against more than 200 people was a savvy undercover agent who knew the customs of Sicilian organized crime, authorities said Friday. `` He was schooled in the rules of the <LOCATION> Sicilian-Italian </LOCATION> underworld _ who to talk to and how to show respect to the elders. He was able to gain the confidence of the Sicilian Mafia,'' said <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ronnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Webb </PERSON>, a supervisory agent in the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION> office. Authorities announced Thursday that they had smashed a major heroin and cocaine ring by charging more than 200 people in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, including Sicilian Mafia figures and associates of the Gambino crime family in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Officials said Friday that 60 people had been arrested in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and 24 in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, and the others were still being sought. Code-named BUSICO for Buffalo-Sicilian Connection, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> operation got its start in 1983 during the arrest of <PERSON> Andrea </PERSON> <PERSON> Aiello </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION> on charges of trying to import some 50 pounds of heroin. At the time, it was called the largest heroin seizure ever in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. In the course of the Aiello investigation, the undercover agent learned of the desire by Sicilian crime figures to ship heroin to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> through <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION>. Despite the attention the <PERSON> Aiello </PERSON> case drew, the <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION> agent remained undercover and was able to cultivate underworld contacts for several years. <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Naum </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> public affairs officer, said the agent, whose identity is being kept secret, was skilled at passing himself as a drug dealer. `` It was Acting 101 for him sometimes,'' <PERSON> Naum </PERSON> said. The investigation speeded up in 1985 with the so-called `` Pizza Connection'' arrests in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and other cities. After that, <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> said, the Sicilians considered <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> `` too hot.'' Buffalo was targeted by smugglers because it is close to <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and 400 miles away from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and its large number of narcotics agents, authorities said. In the spring of 1986, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> set up a phony international trading business, dubbed BSC Partake Wholesale, in a <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION> suburb. The idea was to import heroin concealed in jars of tomatoes and olive oil. Although the operation never developed as a narcotics distribution point, it did allow the undercover agent to broaden his contacts among drug dealers in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>. The agent went to <LOCATION> Sicily </LOCATION>, where he was able to win the confidence of the Sicilian `` family'' running the smuggling operation. When he returned in 1987, BSC Partake Wholesale made `` dry run'' to test the route. The Sicilian organization sent the <LOCATION> Hamburg </LOCATION> company 744 cases of tomatoes. In July, the cases of tomatoes arrived in <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION> undisturbed. <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents and local <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Customs agents had notified customs in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, and officials quickly sent the shipment through, <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> said. At the same time, undercover agents flew to <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Rockford </LOCATION>, Ill. Using ties to the Sicilian family, they met international drug smugglers with global operations. `` The investigation mushroomed from there,'' <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> said. BUSICO spun off a number of undercover operations in other cities, including <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J </LOCATION>. Authorities were reluctant in give details of those operations because they were continuing. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, however, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> <PERSON> Guliani </PERSON> said a related investigation revealed that members of the Gambino crime family were importing heroin in wine bottles from <LOCATION> Sicily </LOCATION> and distributing it to buyers through pizza parlors. The Gambino organization swapped cocaine for the heroin. Cocaine has a higher street value in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Guliani </PERSON> said. The deal is evidence of the increasing role of the Mafia in cocaine trafficking, he said. Previously, cocaine trafficking was mainly the business of South American drug lords.

 A former Israeli government adviser who allegedly played a role in the Iran-Contra affair was not on `` any official business'' when he was killed in a plane crash in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> said Friday. <PERSON> Amiram </PERSON> <PERSON> Nir </PERSON> was killed Wednesday while traveling under an assumed name. <PERSON> Nir </PERSON>, 37, was a former conterterrorism adviser to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> who once briefed Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on secret arms sales to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. He was killed Wednesday when a <ORGANIZATION> Cessna </ORGANIZATION> T210 he had chartered crashed at a ranch near <LOCATION> Ciudad </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hidalgo </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Michoacan </LOCATION> state, 110 miles west of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. The pilot also was killed and three other passengers were injured. Embassy spokesman <PERSON> Israel </PERSON> <PERSON> Mey-Ami </PERSON> said in a telephone interview: `` He was not here in any official business and he did not contact the embassy. I do n't know how long he was in this country, but it mus n't have been very long.'' <PERSON> Mey-Ami </PERSON> said he went to <LOCATION> Morelia </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Michoacan </LOCATION> state capital, on Thursday to get the body and bring it to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. He said it would returned to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Isauro </PERSON> <PERSON> Gutierrez </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON>, a spokesman for the state attorney general's office, said <PERSON> Nir </PERSON> was traveling under the name <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Weber </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gutierrez </PERSON> said by telephone Thursday he did not know why <PERSON> Nir </PERSON> was using as assumed name and <PERSON> Mey-Ami </PERSON> said he had no more details. <PERSON> Nir </PERSON> arrived in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> on Sunday and traveled to <LOCATION> Uruapan </LOCATION>, 190 miles west, to stay with friends. `` it appears he had some possible business involving shipments of products from <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Gutierrez </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Dov </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmorak </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> ambassador, said in an interview on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> that <PERSON> Nir </PERSON> apparently missed a regularly scheduled flight from <LOCATION> Uruapan </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and hired a private plane. He quoted Mexican authorities as saying preliminary information suggested the crash was caused by a rain storm. <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON>, special prosecutor in the Iran-Contra case, had sought <PERSON> Nir </PERSON> for questioning, but <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> insisted he be granted immunity from prosecution so <PERSON> Nir </PERSON> never testified. Testimony given to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> congressional investigators said <PERSON> Nir </PERSON> was an important liaison in secret arms deals involving the sale of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> weapons to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. Former White House aide <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> suggested it was <PERSON> Nir </PERSON>'s idea to divert funds from the arms sales to Nicaraguan rebels. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has denied it. <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, now <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> foreign minister, appointed <PERSON> Nir </PERSON> as his adviser on counterterrorism in 1985 when he was prime minister and assigned him to serve as liaison with <PERSON> North </PERSON>. <PERSON> Nir </PERSON>, a former journalist, met in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> with <PERSON> North </PERSON> and Adm. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s national security adviser, in January 1986 and proposed renewing arms shipments to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. At meetings with North in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, he discussed shipping <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arms through <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and diverting profits to the rebels, known as Contras. A ban by the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on military aid to the Contras was in force at the time. The Israeli also accompanied North and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON>, the former national security adviser, to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in May 1986 to discuss the release of American hostages held by pro-Iranian Lebanese in return for Hawk wanti-aircraft Hawk missiles.

 For 8 -LCB- years, come rain or snow, Sen. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON>, D-Wis., and Labor Statistics Commissioner <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Norwood </PERSON> have met the first Friday of every month in the <ORGANIZATION> Dirksen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Office Building for an economic tea dance Much as he tried to set the beat, she'd only waltz. They had their last session Friday, with the 73-year-old senator holding his final hearing of the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> before retiring next month. As usual, <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON> asked leading questions, attempting to get the chief keeper of the nation's economic statistics to pooh-pooh the rosy spin the administration puts on the employment figures each month. With equal aplomb, Mrs. <PERSON> Norwood </PERSON>, a holdover appointee of former President <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> reappointed twice by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, carefully phrased her answers to avoid any direct or implied criticism of economic policymaking by the Presdent, the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> or the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>. Addressing Mrs. <PERSON> Norwood </PERSON> for the last time as a member of the committee in her 101st appearance before it, <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON> said he expected her usual `` public, truthful and unvarnished explanation'' of the November numbers. However, that did not prevent him from trying one last time to get her critize the administration's latest and last economic forecast of 3.5 percent growth, 3.7 percent inflation and a 5.2 percent unemployment rate for next year. `` I want to see if you can evade this question?'' he said, referring in good humor to their past duels. Mrs. <PERSON> Norwood </PERSON> responded that with the labor force growing less slowly, it will be easier for the nation to maintain lower unemployment rates than in the past and that there really is n't much evidence of any wage inflation. But she acknowledged that `` it will be very, very, very difficult to achieve both'' a 5 percent unemployment rates and an inflation rate declining to 1.5 percent by 1994 as the administration forecasts. <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON> began holding the hearings 17 years ago in response to an order by President <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> to the labor statistics commssioner at the time, <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, to quit giving the press briefings on the numbers. If the labor statistics commissioner could not hold a press conference to offer a `` truthful and unvarnished explanation'' of the numbers, as <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON> said at the time, then <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would compel it in the form of a hearing. While the only people in attendance normally are limited to <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON>, Mrs. <PERSON> Norwood </PERSON>, a few members of each's staff and a handful of reporters, no force _ including the weather _ has been able to get in their way since. Both usually hang around briefly upon the conclusion of the hearings to answer questions from reporters on the numbers. A year ago, when the rest of the government was shut down by a severe blizzard on an unemployment-report Friday, <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON> jogged through the snow to make the hearings and Mrs. <PERSON> Norwood </PERSON> spent the preceding night in a hotel near the Capitol to make sure the weather would not interfere with her attenndance. Other economists in the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistic </ORGANIZATION> left their homes at 4:30 a.m., some of them walking miles from the <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> suburbs to their offices, to make sure that experts who compiled the report would be available to answer questions upon its release at 8:30 a.m. Both <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> BLS </ORGANIZATION> officials said Friday they expect that tradition to continue. `` This is very important to her,'' said <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Lowenstern </PERSON>, an assistant labor statistics commissioner. `` She really believes in the need for a public forum.'' <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON> said he is sure that Rep. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>, D-Ind., now the committee's chairman, will maintain the practice of the monthly hearings `` I think we have them pretty well established now,'' he said.

 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> appealed Friday for an international conference aimed at demilitarizing <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> after a decade of civil war, and said it hoped such a forum would lead to a coalition government. `` The main thing is to involve an international mechanism in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> for avoiding bloodshed in that country,'' Deputy Foreign Minister <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Petrovsky </PERSON> said at a news briefing. He said <PERSON> Yuli </PERSON> <PERSON> Vorontsov </PERSON>, first deputy foreign minister and ambassador to <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, would fly to <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> on Saturday to meet with <PERSON> Burhanuddin </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabbani </PERSON>, current chairman of the Afghan guerrilla alliance.

The Soviets have suspended their withdrawal to protest continued fighting by the U.S.-supported guerrillas, who were not parties to the agreement and said when it was signed they would continue the war. Moslem insurgents began fighting after a Communist coup in April 1978 and Soviet military forces entered <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in December 1979. An estimated 115,000 Soviet soldiers were in the country when the withdrawal began May 15. Half the Red Army troops were gone by Aug. 15, as stipulated in the agreement, and the rest are to be out by Feb. 15, 1989. <PERSON> Petrovsky </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is urging the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> to organize a conference as soon as possible. He set no conditions about the participants or location. He said it was `` important that <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> be represented at the conference by a broadly based coalition government,'' which the Afghan government has been trying to form.

 Her election has been called a `` final crisis for the church,'' but a clergywoman is quietly accumulating the votes to become the first woman bishop in the worldwide Anglican communion. The Rev. <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, elected Sept. 24 by the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> diocese to serve as suffragan -LRB- assistant -RRB- bishop, already has support from more than two-thirds of the 120 Standing Committees needed to confirm her election, according to <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Solheim </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> diocese. Solheim said <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> also is expected to win the necessary support from the <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> bishops, since the majority of them already support women priests. But even her supporters acknowledge that <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>' consecration promises to create a rift between conservative and liberal branches that will test the unity of a church that has been known for its ability to overcome divisive issues. Objections to <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>' election range from her gender to a perception that she lacks sufficient training. <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> attended <ORGANIZATION> Villanova </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> but has no degree. She studied theology through correspondence courses and with tutors rather than attending a seminary. `` The final crisis of the <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> is now upon us,'' began a pastoral letter from seven bishops of the Evangelical and <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mission </ORGANIZATION>, an Episcopal group that opposes female priests and bishops. The bishops said elevating <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> to bishop would amount to rejecting the image of God as a male `` in favor of a religiosity tailored to human convenience.'' The question bothering <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>' critics, <ORGANIZATION> Solheim </ORGANIZATION> said, has more to do with the future unity of the church than with her own gender or political views since some bishops say they will never support the ordination of women. Such opposition in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> is minimal, said <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Penn </PERSON>, a diocesan spokesman. <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, 58, is refusing to comment publicly on the storm surrounding her election until a majority of the standing committees and <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> bishops give her their support, making the election official. Some 1,200 women have been ordained since the <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in 1976 decided to allow women priests. That decision paved the way for female bishops, since all bishops must first serve as priests. The issue of women bishops is viewed more seriously because of their powers to ordain priests and confirm believers. <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> would become the first woman bishop in the historic apostolic succession, a direct line of Christian hierarchy dating back to <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON>' apostles. <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> became a priest in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> in 1980 after a career in corporate public relations. Most recently she has headed the <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publishing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> that produces The Witness, a liberal church publication. In a compromise measure in July, the <ORGANIZATION> Episcopal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>'s governing convention in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> approved a measure allowing any congregation rejecting a woman bishop to petition for a male `` Episcopal visitor'' bishop to administer confirmations. But the woman bishop still would make the periodic pastoral visits required by church law, even to congregations rejecting women bishops.

 Fourteen months ago they wed in a fairy-tale ceremony at an Alpine castle. On Friday, one of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s aristocratic young couples was buried _ the princess a victim of an apparent drug overdose, her prince driven to suicide Mourned by 150 noble relatives, <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> <PERSON> Ludwig </PERSON> <PERSON> Rudolf </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Hanover </LOCATION>, a 33-year-old great-grandson of <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s last emperor, and his 26-year-old bride, <PERSON> Isabelle </PERSON>, were laid to rest in a driving frozen rain in the village of <LOCATION> Gruenau </LOCATION>, 120 miles west of <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>. Among the mourners at a Mass in the whitewashed village church were the prince's aunt, Princess <PERSON> Sophie </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>, sister of Queen <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>'s husband, the Duke of <LOCATION> Edinburgh </LOCATION>, and four members of <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>'s deposed House of <LOCATION> Hapsburg </LOCATION>. The ceremony made no mention of how they died. With similar restraint, none of the noble houses that sent about 40 wreaths to the funeral signed their family names. At least two wreaths bore a royal crown. The funeral came 14 months after a lavish five-day wedding in the Alpine castle of <LOCATION> Bleiburg </LOCATION> in southern <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, home of the bride, <PERSON> Countess </PERSON> <PERSON> Isabelle </PERSON> von Thurn. Five months later, as the Austrian tabloid Kurier respectfully phrased it, <PERSON> Isabelle </PERSON> `` made a gift'' of a son, <PERSON> Otto </PERSON>, to her husband. On Sunday night, the princely pair again made news. This time, it was gruesome. After dining with an obscure West German pop group and an unidentified American, <PERSON> Isabelle </PERSON> retired to her bedroom in the couple's home, the so-called `` Queen's Villa'' in <LOCATION> Gmunden </LOCATION>, 150 miles west of the capital. Several hours later, the prince found his wife dead on the bed from what police said was apparently a drug overdose, probably cocaine. The prince, who was `` in shock,'' drove from the house and shot himself in a nearby forest of the Almtal valley, his family said. The couple's grisly end has dented popular images of aristocrats embodying the vanished glory of the still-beloved <LOCATION> Hapsburg </LOCATION> monarchy, forced to abdicate in 1918 at the end of World War I. Ever since the deaths became known Monday, newspapers in <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> have painted a different picture of what Kurier on Friday sardonically labeled `` high society.'' Reporters trying to learn more about the dead couple got little out of aristocrats at fashionable <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> nightspots. Few admitted to knowing the pair, and none discussed the use of what Germans often call the `` noble drug'' _ cocaine, which is blamed here for a record number of fatal overdoses this year. Such silence reportedly hampers police tracking well-born drug offenders. `` There are barriers we simply ca n't cross,'' <LOCATION> Salzburg </LOCATION> narcotics detective <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Walder </PERSON> told Kurier. Police insisted on anonymity this week when revealing that old needle marks were found on the arms of the royal couple and used syringes were confiscated from their home. `` I do n't want to burn my fingers,'' said one police official. A preliminary autopsy on the princess showed she died of heart and lung edema, or swelling from an abnormal accumulation of fluid, apparently caused by a cocaine overdose. Asked if more autopsy tests would be made public, an official at a local state prosecutor's office voiced relief no trial would be necessary `` Death ends all punishment,'' he noted, demanding anonymity. Prince <PERSON> Ludwig </PERSON> <PERSON> Rudolf </PERSON> was no stranger to the courtroom. In 1981, according to press reports reluctantly confirmed by <LOCATION> Munich </LOCATION> state prosecutors, he testified at a drug trial that also involved <PERSON> Rainer </PERSON> <PERSON> Werner </PERSON> <PERSON> Fassbinder </PERSON>, the West German film director who died after a cocaine overdose in 1982. Asked why he transferred some $ 20,000 to the account of a suspected cocaine dealer, the prince reportedly told the <LOCATION> Munich </LOCATION> court the money was to pay for a car. Last week, state prosecutors in the West German city of <LOCATION> Hanover </LOCATION> closed another drug trafficking investigation against the prince for lack of evidence. Word that the investigation was dropped apparently had not reached the prince when he shot himself, <LOCATION> Hanover </LOCATION> prosecutor's spokesman <PERSON> Klaus </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramberger </PERSON> said Newspapers have speculated this may have increased the panic the prince felt when he found his wife dead at 2:45 a.m. Monday. <PERSON> Ludwig </PERSON> <PERSON> Rudolf </PERSON> quickly alerted the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>, telling them in a telephone call that his wife might have taken cocaine. Police later tested the other guests at the villa for drug abuse and pronounced them clean. But the prince reportedly did not wait even for the emergency doctor to arrive to examine his wife before leaving the villa, taking a hunting gun. According to press reports based on police sources, he did call his brother in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Prince </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ernst </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> August </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hanover </ORGANIZATION>, telling him of his suicide plans and asking him to take care of his baby son. The line to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> then went dead. Police alerted to look for <PERSON> Ludwig </PERSON> <PERSON> Rudolf </PERSON> failed to find him before a forest worker discovered his body slumped across the steering wheel of his car, with a bullet wound to the head.

 Police seized two children from a courthouse while their mother was inside testifying before a grand jury about allegations that she tried to sell one of them for cocaine. `` I did n't know what was going on,'' said <PERSON> Rhonda </PERSON> <PERSON> Romero </PERSON>. `` I walk outside and my kids are gone. They told me I'd sold him for 2 ounces of cocaine. This is ridiculous.'' Ms. <PERSON> Romero </PERSON> was testifying before the <LOCATION> Nueces </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Grand Jury on Thursday when police took the children, 1 and 2 years old. Police did not have a court order to seize the boys, but the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Family Code says a court order is not necessary if there is `` immediate danger to the physical health or safety of the child and there is no time to obtain a temporary restraining order,'' said District Attorney <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said the grand jury is investigating the `` sale or attempted sale'' of a child. Ms. <PERSON> Romero </PERSON> said she is unemployed and could not care for the children properly, so she was trying to find them decent homes. The older boy was staying with another couple but that she did not trade the child for drugs. The grand jury was to continue hearing testimony in the case. The children will be supervised by the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> until a court hearing within 10 days determines who should care for them.

 At least one assassin with a silenced pistol slipped into a guarded hospital room Friday and killed a Moslem suspected in a fatal car bombing, police reported.

Authorities arrested him after a car bomb exploded Sept. 28 at a Syrian army checkpoint on the coastal highway south of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>.

A hospital spokesman confirmed the killing but gave no details.

<TEXT>
 Soviet and <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> delegates to an Emerging Leaders Summit heard letters Friday from <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who said world peace could be developed through better understanding. `` You are the leaders of tomorrow,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in a letter read during a plenary session that opened the week-long conference. The conference has 340 delegates, most of them in their 20s and 30s, from the two nations. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, originally expected to attend the conference as part of his visit to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> next week to address the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, sent a letter that echoed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s. `` Your forum is a sign of real changes for the better in the world,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said. `` It's your mission to advance history, to write its new pages and chapters. You are to carry the burden and beauty of insuring conclusively that it will be no longer be written by the sword and the yoke.'' <PERSON> Viktor </PERSON> <PERSON> Mironenko </PERSON>, 35, first secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Youth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Presidium </ORGANIZATION> and head of the <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> delegation, took up the theme. Referring to <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>'s role in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> history and the writing of the Constitution, <PERSON> Mironenko </PERSON> said the challenges today's delegates face are even tougher because they are more complex. `` Each generation of humans takes one or more steps toward making the world free of wars and aggression. We are striving ahead -LRB- even though -RRB- our world is far from perfect. But we have to live in this world together,'' he said. Alluding to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s current `` glasnost'' reforms, <PERSON> Mironenko </PERSON> said: `` we have come to the conclusion that it is open-ness not close-ness that makes society strong.'' Sixteen delegate commissions will cover major topics affecting the two world powers _ government and political affairs, international business and trade, youth work and social service, domestic and international law, military, media, religion, labor and management, education, global environment, international finance, science and technology, medicine and health care. Each commission has scheduled seven three-hour sessions during the week. `` We must understand each other better because it will help world peace,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Arlen </PERSON> <PERSON> Specter </PERSON>, R-Pa., applauding <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s efforts to democratize Soviet `` It is a very healthy sign. `` As we view democracy in the changing <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> we are more impressed by the dissents than the agreements.'' There will be daily updates on each commission's discussions, which are closed to the public and to reporters. At the end of the summit next week, delegates will compile `` The Final Appeal,'' a document outlining strategies for improved relations between the superpowers. <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>, assistant secretary of commerce in the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> adminstration, told delegates there is world confusion `` on what <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> represents. Does he want to make the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> stronger in the world community or is he really seeking change. `` Then there is skepticism. The alienation between the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has existed for so long that many Americans are skeptical whether any new leader can make any change permanent,'' <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON> said. American Rabbi <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Zola </PERSON>, 32, of <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>, said he expected the religious sessions will touch on `` human rights, freedom of religion and, of course, Soviet Jews.'' `` That means bilateral relations, humanitarian issues, regional conflicts,'' said <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> <PERSON> Chelnokov </PERSON>. <PERSON> Chelnokov </PERSON> is head of the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Youth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organizations </ORGANIZATION>, which is co-sponsoring the meeting with the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leadership </ORGANIZATION>. In addition to the formal meetings, the delegates will have sightseeing, lunches at various educational institutions and dinners at homes, and on Saturday the <ORGANIZATION> Army-Navy </ORGANIZATION> football game.

 Villagers set out Friday to rebuild homes and businesses flattened by a cyclone earlier this week that left at least 787 people dead and 3,250 missing. `` I have lost everything: my home, my crops, my cattle,'' said <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON>, a 45-year-old farmer who found temporary shelter in a school building with his wife and five children in a school building. `` There is no future for me and my family.'' <PERSON> Dainik </PERSON> <PERSON> Bangla </PERSON>, an independent newspaper, said more than 10,000 people were injured and 5 million left homeless. The storm hit southern <LOCATION> Bengladesh </LOCATION> and eastern <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> on Tuesday with winds of up to 102 mph and 15-foot waves that flooded coastal islands and sandbars inhabited by fishermen and peasants. It mowed down utility poles and palm trees, killed thousands of cattle and devastated rice paddies ready for harvest. Not a single mud-and-straw house was left standing in <LOCATION> Shamnagar </LOCATION>, a town of 6,000 people where 10 people were killed. <PERSON> Rahmat </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON>, 28, said he borrowed the equivalent of $ 16 from his wife's parents to buy bamboo and straw to rebuild his grocery store in the marketplace. `` The winds came howling late in the evening and continued until midnight,'' he said. `` Next morning, my shop and whatever little was there was swept away by the cyclone.'' Dozens of other southern villages suffered similar fates. Official reports said 577 people were killed but that estimate is considered conservative. The <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crescent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, the Moslem equivalent of the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>, said 806 people died, mostly in the southwestern districts of <LOCATION> Khulna </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Satkhira </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bagerhat </LOCATION>, and the independent <PERSON> Khabar </PERSON> newspaper put the death toll at 1,050. The <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crescent </ORGANIZATION> also said more than 3,000 were still missing, mostly fishermen. In the Indian city of <LOCATION> Calcutta </LOCATION>, police sources said 210 people had died in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bengal </LOCATION> state next to <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>. Indian news agencies, however, said the death toll was 500, with at least 250 people reported missing. The death toll has not approached from a 1970 cyclone that claimed at least 300,000 lives. Tuesday's cyclone struck while <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> was recovering from summer floods that inundated three-fourths of the country and killed at least 1,500 people.

 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, formerly bitter rivals, met cordially Friday though <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> resorted to campaign rhetoric in warning `` the chickens are coming home to roost'' from Republican economic policies. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who defeated the Democratic governor of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> for the presidency on Nov. 8, said the post-election visit was `` in the finest tradition of American politics.'' The president-elect, who instigated the meeting, said, `` I want to express my appreciation to Governor <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for coming our way. We had good discussion of the issues that are facing the country in a spirit of good will.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> also called it a good discussion. He offered no judgment on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s early transition moves, saying, `` The real test will come when the new administration is fully formed and begins to move forward with its priorities.'' The vice president-elect, <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, often the object of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' scorn during the campaign, greeted him inside the vice president's residence, along with <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign manager and his choice for secretary of state. Both left before <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s 35-minute meeting with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. After the visit, the two stepped out without topcoats into the brisk afternoon for a brief word with reporters. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who earlier Friday made a series of calls on the Democratic leaders of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, said he and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` talked about the future. I expressed my concern obviously about the deficit'' and some of the issues the <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> campaigned on _ better health care, housing, education and the environment. He said he did n't bring up the negative tenor of the campaign. `` We had a good, tough campaign. That's behind us,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` The question now is how do we build a good country.'' The governor joked that he was hesitant to offer <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> advice on the deficit given his own problems with his state's budget. But then he said in earnest that the country faces `` a very formidable challenge. We've had eight years of endless borrowing and spending and the chickens are coming home to roost.'' He said, `` The vice president is anxious to learn and listen and reach out and that's a good thing.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> left him with a seasonal wish: `` God bless you and have a great Christmas.'' Earlier, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> met at the White House with a former <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> rival, <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, and spoke of `` the wonderful way'' that friendships survive campaign battles. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, who returned last week from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, gave <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> an upbeat report on racial progress in the white-ruled country and said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told him he wished <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and other black American leaders would visit <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and `` explore firsthand what's happening because there have been some significant changes over the last 10 years. On another subject, as <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s presidential transition efforts moved closer to the Jan. 20 inauguration, the vice president expressed chagrin at reporters' questions about why he made no additions to his Cabinet this week. `` There's no holdup. We're way ahead of schedule,'' he said, complaining about `` early, premature, needless speculation.'' At the outset of the meeting with <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` Some people do n't understand the campaign. They think that when you run against someone in a campaign, that that injures friendships.'' Citing earlier sessions with Democratic leaders, including <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` That's not true. It's wonderful the way the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> political system works.'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>, a longtime critic of sanctions against <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s government, said he gave <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> a private message from that nation's foreign minister about the situation in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> in southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and the proposed withdrawal of Cuban troops `` The time has come to recognize the South African government needs a little encouragement,'' said the conservative television evangelist. He cited as positive steps the government's movement from prison to a halfway house of <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> and the commutation of death sentences for the <LOCATION> Sharpeville </LOCATION> Six. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> said he had spoken with black mayors in <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION>. `` Seventy-five percent of the black people in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> are saying, ` Please, we do n't want sanctions and disinvestment because they are falling most severely on the poor blacks of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>,''' he said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> began his day meeting with <LOCATION> Bermuda </LOCATION> Premier <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Swan </PERSON> and ended it with a courtesy call from Argentine President <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON>, who had reports of a mutiny by army troops back in <LOCATION> Buenos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aires </LOCATION> to worry about. The president-elect also was meeting a group of evangelical leaders. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was asked if he had a place in his Cabinet for <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>. `` Just good friend,'' the television evangelist interjected. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who reviled <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> during the campaign as `` another liberal governor coming out of nowhere,'' made clear immediately after the election that he hoped to bury the hatchet as quickly as possible.

 Six Contra supporters accused of attacking <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> urged a judge Friday to dismiss their case on the grounds the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has been waging a de facto war against the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>. They asked <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roettger </PERSON> to throw out an indictment accusing them of violating the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Neutrality Act by recruiting mercenaries and launching operations against the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> government in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soil in 1985. `` This is a ludicrous thing,'' said defendant <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Calero </PERSON>, brother of top Contra leader <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Calero </PERSON>. `` There has not been a violation of the Neutrality Act. The executive branch was funding and directing the war.'' <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Calero </PERSON> testified Friday that the rebels continued to receive <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid, such as private contributions funneled through then-White House aide <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>, even during the time that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> cut off military funds. In testimony reminiscent of what he told the Iran-Contra investigations, he said <PERSON> North </PERSON> and other government officials never advised him to cease his activities because of the congressional action. `` It was the opposite,'' said the Contra leader. `` We were told not to give up, to continue the struggle.'' After the day's testimony, <PERSON> Roettger </PERSON> continued the pretrial hearing until Jan. 5 and said he would rule on the dismissal motion shortly thereafter. The Neutrality Act forbids private citizens from launching U.S.-based military operations against any nation with which the nation is at peace. The defendants won a quick procedural victory when <PERSON> Roettger </PERSON> brushed aside the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's efforts to delay arguments on the issue until trial. Just before the noon recess, <PERSON> Roettger </PERSON> agreed to take more testimony, and warned prosecutors that he expected to look broadly at the war and peace issue. At one point, the judge also expressed impatience with the prosecution's contention that the only purpose of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid to the Nicaraguan Contras was to interdict arms to leftist rebels in nearby <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. Referring to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, the judge said: `` I remember a badge that said ` I'm a Contra too.' It did n't say anything about interdicting arms.'' The judge sharply questioned Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubelier </PERSON> on whether the government contends it was at peace with <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> when <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> jets attacked <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION> in 1986. <PERSON> Dubelier </PERSON> conceded the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> was not at peace with <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> in that case, but asked in return, `` Where do you draw the line?'' If the defense's line of reasoning was accepted, <PERSON> Dubelier </PERSON> said, `` then the Neutrality Act could not be used now against anyone preparing to invade the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>.'' The group was indicted in June after charges of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration foot-dragging. Opponents of aid to the Contras accused former Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> of stalling the case because it threatened to uncover <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s involvement. The indictment accused the Contra supporters of recruiting and training mercenaries to fight with Contras, supplying them with equipment, leading them on expeditions, including one aimed at blowing up a Nicaraguan bridge, and violating firearms laws. The seven original defendants were <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Posey </PERSON>, head of the Alabama-based <ORGANIZATION> Civilian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Materiel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assistance </ORGANIZATION> group; <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Calero </PERSON>, a former supply manager for the rebels; <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON>'s former bodyguard; <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Terrell </PERSON>, a former mercenary who turned against the effort and went to authorities; <PERSON> Maco </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>, a wealthy former <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> businessman and state official who now lives in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Coutin </PERSON>, a Civilian Materiel Assistance liaison in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>; and <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, a conservative Cuban-American stockbroker. <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> allegedly financed some of the activities. Some of the defendants, including <PERSON> Terrell </PERSON> and <PERSON> Posey </PERSON>, have produced documents showing the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> and other agencies were aware of their activities in aiding the Contras, and have said knowledge of their activities went all the way to the White House. But <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> decided to plead guilty and received a sentence of a $ 50 fine and one day of probation. The other six defendants continue to fight the charges. <PERSON> Terrell </PERSON>, who faces a possible 33-year jail sentence, was accused of buying a Manlicher .308 - caliber rifle to be used as a sniper weapon in <PERSON> Coutin </PERSON> faces 13 years if convicted because he allegedly gave his passport to a mercenary, while the rest face up to eight years on two Neutrality Act violations. A second Neutrality Act indictment returned by the same grand jury accuses six more men of running a training camp for the Contras, as well as supplying them with weapons that included a 20mm cannon. That case is being heard by a different judge.

 British Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> criticized <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>'s premier Friday for refusing to extradite a pro-IRA priest, a dispute that overshadowed a <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> summit meeting. In the some of the angriest exchanges reported between leaders in the trade bloc, Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> told Premier <PERSON> Wilfried </PERSON> <PERSON> Martens </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION> that she was `` mystified and deeply wounded'' by his government's refusal to extradite <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>. British police suspect the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> priest of involvement in a series of <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> bombings and other terrorist offenses. Soon after the angry meeting in Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s hotel suite, she and <PERSON> Martens </PERSON> sat side-by-side as the leaders of the 12-nation community reviewed their ambitious program to dismantle all trade barriers and create by 1992 a single market of 322 million people. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, who has been criticized for being wary of the trade agreement, argued during the afternoon meeting that some border restrictions must remain in place to control terrorism, drug dealing and arms smuggling, officials said. `` Insular thinking ... is a reality,'' Dutch Prime Minister <PERSON> Ruud </PERSON> <PERSON> Lubbers </PERSON> said of Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>. `` But I have never seen her more relaxed. She sees this summit ... as the start of a debate,'' he told reporters after the three-and-a-half hour session. The two-day meeting among the often-quarrelsome European leaders, which began Friday, had been expected to produce few problems. Tough decisions on closer union, including monetary cooperation and a single tax system, are due at the next six-monthly summit in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>. Central to the informal agenda was a draft statement aimed at reassuring the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> that the community will not shut out their trade in 1992. `` <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> will not close in on itself ... will not be a Fortress <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, but a partnership,'' the draft said. The leaders met in the 14th century Knights of St. <PERSON> John </PERSON> castle on the island. A frigate patrolled offshore and commandos armed with automatic weapons patrolled the beachfront. In the early hours Friday, four bombs exploded in <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION>, 270 miles west of the meeting site, including one at an <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> building. Police said no one was injured. The left-wing <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Struggle </ORGANIZATION>, which has claimed responsibility for more than 500 previous attacks in the past 15 years, said in a message to Greek newspapers that it planted the devices. The priest was arrested in <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION> last summer. Last week, <PERSON> Martens </PERSON>' government turned down the British extradition request and sent him to <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> says it is considering the request, though authorities no longer know where he is. <PERSON> Martens </PERSON> said after meeting Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> that he told her the extradition request was rejected because it was legally flawed. `` It was not a political decision,'' <PERSON> Martens </PERSON> said. A British spokesman said Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> told <PERSON> Martens </PERSON> she was `` mystified and deeply wounded and -LRB- spoke -RRB- of confidence being undermined.''

 A <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> company pleaded guilty Friday to assisting in the filing of a false tax return by a businessman tied to corruption in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> under former President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Ocean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Applied </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> entered the plea in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said. The company, which was fined $ 10,000 and paid $ 38,258 to settle civil claims, aided <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON> in preparing and filing the false tax return for <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON>'s company, <ORGANIZATION> Amworld </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, according to the government. <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON>, who was closely associated with former <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> Gen. <PERSON> Fabian </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ver </PERSON>, chief of the armed forces under <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, pleaded guilty on Dec. 14, 1987, in an alleged $ 6.8 million kickback scheme involving a <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> military communications system. A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arrest warrant was issued some time ago for Ver and still is outstanding, a <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official, <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenburg </PERSON>, said in an interview. At the time <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON> pleaded guilty, the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said that after <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON>'s companies won three contracts totaling $ 28 million in 1983 to modernize the <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> military communications system, seven <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> firms were subcontractors to <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON> and paid him $ 6.8 million in kickbacks. The modernization effort took place under the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s foreign military program. Court papers filed in the OAR case say that the firm was a subcontractor to <LOCATION> Amworld </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> communications system modernization program. <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON>, said the court papers, awarded a subcontract to OAR in 1983 when the company agreed to pay a kickback which eventually totaled $ 658,093 to <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON> through a <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> shell company, <ORGANIZATION> Geomanagement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, also owned by <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON>. OAR provided Amworld with an invoice reflecting twice the actual sales price of goods. <PERSON> Moreno </PERSON> used the inflated invoice furnished by OAR to fraudulently boost <ORGANIZATION> Amworld </ORGANIZATION>'s business expenses on its 1983 corporate income tax return, the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> papers said.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Beatty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> is returning 110 acres of land taken from the <ORGANIZATION> Klamath </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION> in the 1920s. `` I feel really good about <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> doing this,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Kimbol </PERSON>, chairman of the tribe. `` I think it was really a fine gesture on their part.'' A ceremony will be held Sunday at the church, located in the tiny communty of <PERSON> Beatty </PERSON> about 35 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Klamath </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>. The land was deeded to the church by President <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Harding </PERSON> in the 1920s. It was originally part of the <LOCATION> Klamath </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Reservation </LOCATION>, which covered 1.1 million acres before the tribe was dissolved by federal decree in 1954. The Klamaths were restored to tribal status in 1986. The church will retain five acres on which the church stands. The Klamaths currently have about 200 acres of land, mostly Indian cemeteries scattered around the area, <PERSON> Kimbol </PERSON> said. The tribe has n't decided what to do with the land yet, but is putting together plans for economic development, <PERSON> Kimbol </PERSON> said. About 60 percent of the 1,200 tribal members in <LOCATION> Klamath </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> are unemployed, he added. Housing or a community center for about 25 tribal members living in Beatty are possibilities, <PERSON> Kimbol </PERSON> said. The idea of returning the land came from the Revs. <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Seckel </PERSON>, who ministered at four <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> churches in rural <LOCATION> Klamath </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> a few years ago, said <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Davidson </PERSON>, a former lay minister at the Beatty church and a member of the <LOCATION> Klamath </LOCATION> tribe. `` The Indians did n't realize it was there,'' she said. The idea was approved by church leaders and the church's annual conference, she added. As older members have died or moved away, the congregation of the Beatty church has dwindled, to the point where as few as three people sometimes attend services, <PERSON> Davidson </PERSON> said. She said as many as 200 people were expected to attend Sunday's ceremony `` I do n't know how they're going to get them all in the church,'' she said.

 A former volunteer firefighter accused of setting 14 blazes in a town that was terrorized by arson for several months pleaded innocent Friday as his lawyer said authorities have `` the wrong man.'' <PERSON> Lance </PERSON> <PERSON> Lalumiere </PERSON>, 23, stood silent during a brief hearing in the <ORGANIZATION> Coos </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Courthouse </ORGANIZATION> as his lawyer entered innocent pleas to 14 counts of arson and two of attempted arson. The series of 26 fires in and near <LOCATION> Jefferson </LOCATION>, a town of 850 near here, began in May and continued through early October. No one was killed, though there were close calls. <PERSON> Lalumiere </PERSON> was arrested Oct. 12 and has been held without bail since them. He was first charged with setting a fire in his brother's cabin in August, and then was later charged with 15 other arsons or arson attempts. The attorney general's office has said that <PERSON> Lalumiere </PERSON> admitted setting 16 fires. Court documents show that authorities found a hand-drawn map of several arson sites in <PERSON> Lalumiere </PERSON>'s trailer and a propane-type torch in a car he owned. But after Friday's hearing, his lawyer, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Quay </PERSON>, said, `` The police have arrested the wrong man.'' `` <PERSON> Lance </PERSON> has appeared in court today and affirmed his innocence as to each and every one of these charges,'' <PERSON> Quay </PERSON> said. `` We deny all of the assertions contained in each of these charges.'' In addition, he said, many townspeople quoted in news reports since the arrest said <PERSON> Lalumiere </PERSON> could n't have set the fires. Another man has been charged in connection with one of the 26 fires, and authorities say the other nine are still under investigation.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on Friday fined operators of the <LOCATION> Palo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Verde </LOCATION> nuclear power plant $ 250,000 for violations that included one worker's exposure to radiation.

We take the infractions very seriously,'' said <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Karner </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> ANPP </ORGANIZATION> executive vice president. The <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION>'s regional office in <LOCATION> Walnut </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, said the violations included a worker exceeding his radiation exposure limit, part of a reactor unit's air conditioning system being rendered inoperable inadvertently `` and a radiation oversight committee not fulfilling its reponsibilities.'' Palo Verde operators recently announced they plan to spend millions of dollars improving the plant, including hiring dozens of additional engineers to act as troubleshooters, revamping the duties of work crews and retaining consultants. <LOCATION> Palo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Verde </LOCATION>, a three-reactor plant, is located about 50 miles west of downtown <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> previously has imposed several penalties against <LOCATION> Palo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Verde </LOCATION>, including $ 50,000 for deficiencies with a radiation sampling system, $ 100,000 in May 1986 for security deficiencies and $ 100,000 in April for engineering and and operations problems. Other problems have included numerous unplanned shutdowns this year for Palo Verde's Unit 1, which operated at 52.1 percent of capacity this year. Units 2 and 3 operated at 56.3 percent and 90.5 percent, respectively.

 A state judge Friday recommended a new trial for a man whose murder conviction had been questioned in the movie documentary `` The Thin Blue Line.'' District Judge <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Baraka </PERSON> said he will tell the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Criminal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> that <PERSON> Randall </PERSON> <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> deserves a new trial. The appeals court has the power to order the retrial. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> has served 12 years in prison for the shooting of officer <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> in 1976. He said he did not commit the crime. Much of the material being presented in the hearing this week on the retrial request was in the documentary, which raised charges that witnesses in the original trial had lied. `` I'm numb,'' <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said after the judge issued his recommendation. `` I do n't know what to say. Right now, I'm in shock.'' <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>' attorney, <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Schaffer </PERSON>, predicted that there would never be a retrial if the appeals court approves it. `` They've got no evidence. They've got no witnesses.'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Creuzot </PERSON>, an assistant prosecutor, said he had confidence in the judge. `` If that's the way he feels, that's his call to make,'' he said. He said he had no idea if his office would indeed drop the charges if a retrial was ordered. <PERSON> Errol </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>, who made `` The Thin Blue Line,'' said: `` I'm very happy about the judge's decision. I deeply believe in <PERSON> Randall </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>' innocence Obviously, this man should not be in jail.'' As reasons for a new trial, <PERSON> Baraka </PERSON> said the prosecution suppressed some evidence that would bolster the defense, including a written statement from a witness, <PERSON> Emily </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, who gave conflicting information about what she saw at the scene where <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> was killed. The state also kept suppressed the fact taht Ms. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> had picked someone other than <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> when she viewed a police lineup.

<HEAD>Report Says Iranian Airliner Had Only 40 Seconds to React</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MONTREAL (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An Iranian airliner only had 40 seconds to react to a warning before a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warship shot it down on July 3, killing all 290 people aboard, a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> aviation agency report was quoted as saying on Friday. The report prepared by the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> also confirms the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> claim that several warnings were given to the A-300 Airbus before it was shot down in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> by the <LOCATION> USS </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION>, Canadian Press said. The report also says, however, that only a warning from another American ship in the area, the USS Sides, was coded specifically for <ORGANIZATION> Iran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> Flight 655, CP said. That warning came 40 seconds before the jet was destroyed by surface-to-air missiles, CP quoted the report as saying. A warning coded for the civilian aircraft `` could have been immediately recognizable to the flight crew but was given only in the final challenge,'' the report said, according to CP. Other warnings were sent on general military and civilian emergency radio frequencies. Cmdr. <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> had not received the report and would have no comment. <PERSON> Edmund </PERSON> <PERSON> Stohr </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> representative at the aviation organization, refused comment Friday but said in an interview Thursday the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> considers the report fair. Airport officials in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> were unaware a skirmish between the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> and Iranian gunboats in the gulf just before the airliner left <PERSON> Bandar </PERSON> <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON> for a flight across the waterway, said the report, which is to be presented to the agency's governing council Monday. `` No ` red alert' status was in effect and the air traffic control units in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Bandar </PERSON> <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON> were unaware of any activities at sea,'' the report was quoted as saying. A <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> report blamed the downing of the airliner on human error by the crew of the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION>, which mistook the commercial jet for an Iranian F-14 fighter. According to the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> report, the plane was warned 12 times to change its course away from the battle zone. The <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>'s report says the sophisticated Aegis radar system on the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> `` recorded a flight profile consistent with a normal climb profile of an Airbus A-300,'' CP said. The report says the plane was climbing normally from <PERSON> Bandar </PERSON> <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON> airport and was well within the `` lateral'' boundaries of the flight corridor across the gulf. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> investigators said September the Iranian aircraft had been climbing until it was shot down. The <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>'s report, prepared at the request of a special meeting in July of the 33-nation <ORGANIZATION> ICAO </ORGANIZATION> council, is highly technical and does not fix blame. It has been widely circulated at the agency's <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> headquarters.

<DATELINE>SAN LUIS OBISPO, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A novelist and <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> nominee who was charged with stealing thousands of books from more than 70 libraries pleaded no contest Friday to possessing stolen property. <PERSON> Gustav </PERSON> <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hasford </PERSON>, who co-wrote the screenplay for the 1987 screenplay `` Full Metal Jacket,'' entered the plea in a bargain with prosecutors, who dropped two criminal counts of grand theft. The plea was accepted by <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Luis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Obispo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Woolpert </PERSON>. Deputy District Attorney <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Estrada-Mullaney </PERSON> has recommended that Hasford serve six months in jail. <PERSON> Hasford </PERSON>'s defense attorney, <PERSON> Orlan </PERSON> <PERSON> Donley </PERSON>, did not immediately return a telephone call to his office seeking comment. As part of the plea bargain, <PERSON> Hasford </PERSON> also was ordered to pay restitution on all of the criminal counts. Sentencing was set for Jan. 4. <PERSON> Hasford </PERSON> pleaded to possession of about 2,000 books, valued at about $ 20,000, taken from public libraries in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Monica </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Longview </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and the city, county and university libraries in the central <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> coastal community of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Luis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Obispo </LOCATION>. The books were primarily Civil War research volumes, the prosecutor said. The screenplay for the film `` Full Metal Jacket,'' which <PERSON> Hasford </PERSON> co-wrote with director <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Kubrick </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Herr </PERSON>, was drawn largely from <LOCATION> Hasford </LOCATION>'s Vietnam War novel, `` The Short-Timers.'' Although nominated for an Academy Award, the best screenplay Oscar for 1987 was given to the authors of `` The Last Emperor.'' The investigation began on March 17 when police at <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Polytechnic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Obispo </PERSON> served a search warrant at a storage locker rented by <PERSON> Hasford </PERSON>. They were searching for 87 overdue books that <PERSON> Hasford </PERSON> had checked out on his Cal Poly library card. Among the estimated 10,000 books found in <LOCATION> Hasford </LOCATION>'s possession were at least 2,000 allegedly stolen from 77 libraries, Ms. <PERSON> Estrada-Mullaney </PERSON> said. `` We had suspicions about some of the other books, but we could only prove the 2,000,'' she said. Books found in the locker appeared to be from a city library in <LOCATION> Perth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Purdue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>; the <ORGANIZATION> Foxburg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Library </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>; the <LOCATION> Coco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, public library and the <LOCATION> Evanston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Historical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>. Investigators also learned that a book theft warrant for <PERSON> Hasford </PERSON> had been outstanding in <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> for three years.

<TEXT>
 A federal judge Friday accused <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents of misusing a federal grand jury subpoena to retaliate against a Hispanic agent who filed a successful discrimination lawsuit against the bureau. In a 17-page memorandum, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Lucius </PERSON> <PERSON> Bunton </PERSON> ruled that <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents requested a grand jury subpoena during an internal investigation of agent <PERSON> Bernardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> after he and other Hispanic agents sued the bureau. There was no legitimite purpose for the subpoena, he said. The class-action lawsuit filed in January 1987 contended that the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> promoted Hispanic agents too slowly, assigned them less-desirable jobs and gave them little recognition for their successes. <PERSON> Bunton </PERSON> ruled in favor of the Hispanic agents in September; damages have not been determined. In his 17-page opinion Friday, the judge said a subpoena issued in February 1987, three weeks after the lawsuit was filed, was requested without justification to gather telephone records on <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>. The allegation about the subpoena was brought up in August during the trial on the lawsuit, but <PERSON> Bunton </PERSON> postponed consideration of the issue because attorneys for the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> said they were not prepared to respond to it. When a hearing on the issue was held last month, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> denied that the subpoena was requested in retaliation for the lawsuit. But in his ruling Friday, <PERSON> Bunton </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> did not state a `` legitimate, non-retaliatory reason for securing the subpoena ... and that demonstrates that the securing of the grand jury subpoena was not legitimate.'' `` To deny that there was not a close causal relationship between the grand jury subpoena and the filing of the Title VII -LRB- discrimination -RRB- complaint is to fly in the face of reason,'' <PERSON> Bunton </PERSON> concluded. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Silva </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Bunton </PERSON>'s ruling was `` a significant finding in that it details retaliation against Mr. Perez.'' <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> McPoyle </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s headquarters in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> said Friday that he could n't comment on the judge's ruling `` because of the ongoing litigation.'' According to testimony at the hearing last month, <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> officials began investigating <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> in 1986, after he filed an internal discrimination complaint. The investigation concerned statements <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> had made at the espionage trial of a former fellow agent, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> had testified that while he was second-in-command of the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> FBI office, he recommended that his boss, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Bretzing </PERSON>, fire <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> for incompetence. <PERSON> Bretzing </PERSON> denied that <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> ever made that recommendation. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> was not fired at the time, and he was eventually convicted of passing secrets to the Soviets. An <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>, concluded that there was no evidence to bring criminal perjury charges against <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>, but he continued an administrative investigation into the agent. In February 1987, <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> asked a federal prosecutor in <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, to secure a subpoena of telephone records related to <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> said he needed the subpoena to determine whether <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> was telling the truth when he told <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> he had tried to call him from a pay phone in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> while en route to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to meet with him to discuss the <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> case. But thejudge ruled Friday that since the criminal investigation was over at that point, the request for the subpoena was unjustified.

<HEAD>Yugoslav Consulate Closed In Diplomatic Dispute</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CANBERRA, Australia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government shut down the Yugoslav consulate in <LOCATION> Sydney </LOCATION> on Friday and ordered the consulate staff to leave the country after they refused to turn over a security guard who allegedly wounded a protester. The government had set a 24-hour deadline Thursday for <LOCATION> Yugoslav </LOCATION> officials to turn the guard over to Australian police. When the consulate refused to comply, Foreign Minister <PERSON> Gareth </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> said that the staff of 12 and their families must leave <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> by Monday evening. `` I deeply regret <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> has been forced into this action by the refusal of the Yugoslav government to allow the law to take its normal course,'' he said. In <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>, Foreign Minister <PERSON> Budimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Loncar </PERSON> strongly attacked <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> for its actions. In an interview with <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION> television, he said <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> had broken international conventions. He said his government would demand `` satisfaction'' but gave no details and announced no retaliatory moves. `` I must express my great satisfaction, even pride that our consular staff honorably, bravely, decisively and in a dignified manner defended the sovereignty of their country, the territory which belongs to us and the honor of our flag,'' <PERSON> Loncar </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> said his government reserved the right to claim compensation from <LOCATION> Yugoslav </LOCATION> authorities for the family of 16-year-old <PERSON> Jospeh </PERSON> <PERSON> Tokic </PERSON>, who was shot in the throat during a demonstration outside the consulate Sunday, Yugoslav National Day. Yugoslav authorities said the guard, identified as <PERSON> Matijas </PERSON> <PERSON> Zoran </PERSON>, fired in self-defense when several Croatian youths began scaling the consulate walls. Croatians are among several ethnic groups in <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>. About 200,000 Yugoslavs live in <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s state-run <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION> news agency said the <LOCATION> Yugoslav </LOCATION> government referred to the demonstrators as Ustashas, Croatian fascists who allied with <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> against <LOCATION> Yugoslav </LOCATION> resistance forces during World War II.

 In a harsh rebuke to its host country, the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> on Friday voted to move a meeting to <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> so it can hear an address by <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, who was denied a visa to enter the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The assembly voted 154-2 to hold the session in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> on Dec. 13-15. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> were the only nations voting against the measure. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> abstained. It has said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should allow <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> to speak but opposed the harsh criticism of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> resolution. The unprecedented shift to <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> was ordered because the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> rejected <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> appeals to reconsider and admit <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, who it accuses of being an accessory to terrorism. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> sought to address the 159-nation world body here this week during its annual debate on <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION>. He was to have addressed the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to discuss recent decisions of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION> to declare an independent Palestinian state and accept <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> resolutions which implicitly recognize <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right to exist. The meeting in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> would be the first time the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> has convened a regular session outside <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> since the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> first moved into its permanent <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> headquarters, which opened in 1952. Between 1946 and 1952, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> held sessions primarily in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> but also met twice in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> and once, its first meeting, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. Absent from Friday's roll call were <LOCATION> Dominica </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, because of its policies of racial apartheid, was stripped of its voting rights in 1974. After the vote, the highest-ranking <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official at the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, Undersecretary-General <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Verner </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON>, sent a personal letter to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, appealing to him to let <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> speak. The letter was widely but not officially circulated, and <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> said he was not responsible for leaking it to the press. `` The bottom line, Mr. <PERSON> President </PERSON>, is that the action -LRB- to deny a visa -RRB- to an invited guest of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> has done incalculable damage to <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> credibility in the world arena.'' <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is a `` proponent of free speech all over the world, yet it will not permit Chairman <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> to enter the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to speak in a public forum on international territory ... `` Does this spell the end of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> ... `` <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s acting ambassador, <PERSON> Johanan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bein </PERSON>, had urged the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> to reject the measure. `` This assembly is asked to pack its bags and go to another continent for the dubious pleasure of lending an ear to the person who conceived, instigated and organized some of the world's cruellest atrocities against the innocent citizens of many nations. <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Okun </PERSON> said: `` The change of venue is unnecessary. Nevertheless we would not oppose such a move and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would be represented if a meeting were held in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>.'' He said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was justified in denying a visa to <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> envoy <PERSON> Zuhdi </PERSON> <PERSON> Labib </PERSON> <PERSON> Terzi </PERSON> said: `` Once again, within hours, the international body in this community has stood together for what is right against what is wrong.'' He said the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> would have preferred to meet in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` It is only because of the intransigence of the host country and its lack of respect for international law that it has to pick up the bill of more than a million dollars.'' He was referring to transportation costs of all delegations, above the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> estimate of $ 645,500. The three-day meeting at <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>'s stately Palais de Nations, the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> European Headquarters, will require an additional appropriation of $ 440,700, but about $ 204,800 in other costs can be absorbed in the existing budget, <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials said. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> probably would be expected to pay a quarter of the additional cost, in accordance with its one-fourth share of the regular annual budget. It has said it would participate in the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> session. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> is facing a financial crisis, caused largely by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> indebtedness of about $ 500 million. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is the biggest <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> contributor and its biggest debtor nation. On Wednesday the assembly overwhelmingly deplored the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> denial of a visa to <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> to speak in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. It gave the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> 24 hours to reconsider and reverse its decision. On Thursday night, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government defied the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> resolution and rejected its appeal, saying the decision to bar <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> was final. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, who visited the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> in 1974, was barred from visiting the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> on international territory by Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> on grounds that he is an `` accessory to terrorism.'' The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> says that by denying <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> a visa the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has violated the 1947 U.S.-U.N. Headquarters Agreement, under which the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is obligated to grant visas to <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> guests.

 A lawyer for a couple who believe a 10-year-old <LOCATION> Sarasota </LOCATION> girl is their daughter said Friday that he has medical records to support their claim, and a judge gave the couple permission to get more records. <PERSON> Regina </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Twigg </PERSON> maintain their daughter was switched after birth in <ORGANIZATION> Hardee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> with a sickly child and that records were altered to hide the swap. The Twiggs of <LOCATION> Langhorne </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, named the baby they took home <PERSON> Arlena </PERSON> and raised her until her death in August from heart disease. Just before she died they learned through genetic tests that <PERSON> Arlena </PERSON> was not their biological daughter. Her B-positive blood type did n't match their Type <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kimberly </PERSON> <PERSON> Mays </PERSON> was the only other white girl born at the same time at <ORGANIZATION> Hardee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> Her mother died soon after brith. The girl has been raised by her father, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Sarasota </LOCATION> roofing supply salesman who is fighting efforts by the Twiggs to challenge parentage. Attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Blakely </PERSON> made only passing reference to the medical records at a hearing. But outside the courthouse, he said he had documents from Hardee Memorial showing <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Mays </PERSON> had Type B blood and the child she bore was B-positive. The baby also was born with fetal stress and bluish extremities, conditions consistent with heart problems, <PERSON> Blakely </PERSON> said. `` Everything in the records indicates we are correct in assuming Mrs. <PERSON> Mays </PERSON> delivered <PERSON> Arlena </PERSON> <PERSON> Twigg </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Blakely </PERSON> said. `` Hospital records indicate Mrs. <PERSON> Twigg </PERSON> delivered a baby with O-positive.'' <PERSON> Blakely </PERSON> does n't know yet <PERSON> Kimberly </PERSON>'s blood type. However, Circuit Judge <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> granted the Twiggs' motions for hospital medical records on <PERSON> Kimberly </PERSON>'s birth and Mrs. May's pregnancy and delivery, and the results, if any, of any genetic testing that has been done The judge also said <PERSON> Blakely </PERSON> could take sworn statements from medical and custodial personnel at the hospital to document records. `` It was a very successful day in terms of proceeding in this matter,'' <PERSON> Blakely </PERSON> said. The judge denied motions by <PERSON> Mays </PERSON>' attorney, <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Ginsburg </PERSON>, to dismiss the case and force the <PERSON> Twiggs </PERSON> to state beforehand whether they intend to seek custody. The Twiggs want a judicial decree that <PERSON> Kimberly </PERSON> is their daughter. The judge said they have to `` establish their rights'' to her before a decision can be made on parentage. `` I think we're doing it backwards,'' <PERSON> Ginsburg </PERSON> told the judge. `` We are saying to <PERSON> Kimberly </PERSON>, ` We're going to find out who your parents are and then who is going to have custody of you.' `` She does not want to meet the Twiggs. She does n't want to have her blood tested. She wants to stay with her father. No one has asked her what she wants.''

 Two female hostages were released unharmed Friday by two inmates who took them hostage and demanded to meet with reporters over conditions at the overcrowded <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> State <PERSON> Penitentiary </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdula </PERSON> <PERSON> Amin </PERSON>, 37, and <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Calkins </PERSON>, 25, `` gave up without so much as a bad word,'' said Warden <PERSON> Duane </PERSON> <PERSON> Shillinger </PERSON> after the inmates' 5:40 p.m. surrender `` They apologized for what they did and they are not even certain why they did it. The prisoners initially sought a news conference to air their grievances, but surrendered without incident almost 11 hours after taking the women captive. `` Mr. <PERSON> Amin </PERSON> said at one point, ` We do n't know why we did it. It got started and we could n't stop it,''' <PERSON> Shillinger </PERSON> said. The two inmates were taken to the <LOCATION> Carbon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> jail pending the filing of charges against them. The two inmates were wielding knives fashioned from a scissors blade and a razor blade when they took counselors <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> France </PERSON> and <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> hostage shortly after 7 a.m., during sick call in the prison's maximum-security unit. The inmates, both serving sentences for sexual assault convictions, bound themselves to the women with tape and held them captive in a counseling room, <PERSON> Shillinger </PERSON> said. `` My mouth is very dry. We've been through a very emotional day,'' <PERSON> Shillinger </PERSON> said after meeting with the women. `` I'm not ashamed to say that when I saw those women walk out the door, I broke down and cried. We're so glad this turned out in the manner it did.'' Prison officials, including an FBI-trained negotiator, spoke with the inmates by telephone through the day Friday, but <PERSON> Shillinger </PERSON> said any demands beyond those for food would not be granted unless the women were released. Reporters from <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> flocked to the penitentiary in the afternoon, but prison officials kept their presence secret from the inmates. Photographers and television camera operators were prevented from taking pictures. Associate Warden <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Urie </PERSON> said <PERSON> Amin </PERSON> began serving an eight - to 20-year sentence on a conviction of first-degree sexual assault and a life term for a habitual offender conviction in December 1983 <PERSON> Calkins </PERSON> began serving an eight - to 15-year sentence on two convictions of first-degree sexual assault and aggravated burglary in April 1985 Neither <PERSON> Amin </PERSON> nor <PERSON> Calkins </PERSON> had created major problems at the prison in the past, <PERSON> Urie </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> has worked at the prison about three years, and <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> started there last month, said <PERSON> Shillinger </PERSON>. The penitentiary, built because of overcrowding in the state's old prison, was full soon after opening in 1981 Additions and mobile units were constructed in the yard, but the prison population has continued to fill the available space. A report issued last fall said the current penitentiary capacity of 710 inmates was exceeded in August 1987 and January 1988. Prison officials projected the population would reach 800 prisoners by this fall and 900 by May 1990. Officials were not able to immediately provide the current head-count at the prison.

<HEAD>Wilderness Scouts Decline To End Flap By Joining Boy Or Girl Scouts</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BLAIRSVILLE, Ga. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Despite the threat of a lawsuit, <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>'s Wilderness Scouts have decided to remain autonomous rather than affiliate with the national Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts. The directors of the <ORGANIZATION> Wilderness </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scouts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> voted unanimously Thursday to keep both their name and mission, said <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Cornwell </PERSON>, founder of the organization for underprivileged youngsters. The Boy Scouts of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> had threatened to sue the Wilderness Scouts over their use of the word `` scout,'' which the Boy Scouts claim the rights to. But on Monday, Boy Scout officials offered to charter the Wilderness Scouts as an affiliate of the national organization. Under the plan, female Wilderness Scouts would have become Girl Scouts and male Wilderness Scouts would become Boy Scouts. <PERSON> Cornwell </PERSON> said his 45-member group decided to remain separate, in part because of a child molestation case involving one of his scouts. The stepfather of the scout was sentenced Thursday to 20 years plus fines for aggravated sodomy. `` We were instrumental in bringing this case forward,'' <PERSON> Cornwell </PERSON> said. `` We noticed he was distraught and crying in the meetings. `` That little boy would never have been able to join the Boy Scouts,'' <PERSON> Cornwell </PERSON> said. `` He did n't even have a bed; he slept on the floor. Who would have paid his dues? Some of our kids do n't even have a toothbrush. That's Third World poverty as far as I'm concerned. <PERSON> Cornwell </PERSON> said his group's volunteer attorney, who specializes in patent and copyright law, `` says keep on with our mission.'' <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Brock </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Boy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scouts </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Northeast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, said Boy Scout officials had hoped the dispute would be settled by chartering <PERSON> Cornwell </PERSON>'s scouts. He said further action will have to be determined by national Boy Scout officials. `` We're not opposed to their activities,'' <PERSON> Brock </PERSON> said. `` The only issue is the use of the word ` scout.''' <PERSON> Cornwell </PERSON>, a disabled <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veteran, founded the group five years ago to help children with backgrounds similar to his own. He was raised in a one-parent home after his father was murdered, and he could not afford a Boy Scout uniform or badges as a youth. Wilderness Scouts have no dues, uniforms or badges, but are active in conservation and service in the community.

 <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s consul general in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> was ordered to appear in a <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> court Saturday for a hearing on charges he took part in a money laundering scheme. A 17-month sting operation culminated Thursday with the announcement of a 21-count indictment naming <PERSON> Bahrudin </PERSON> <PERSON> Bijedic </PERSON>, 52, and four other men, along with <ORGANIZATION> LBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> branch of a <LOCATION> Yugoslavian </LOCATION> bank. At a hearing in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> Friday, <PERSON> Bijedic </PERSON> was released from custody but ordered to remain in the company of <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> officials until Saturday's appearance in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. `` I want you to be able to travel not in the context of a prisoner, but you will have to follow the directions of the agents who accompany you,'' said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Magistrate <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Weisberg </PERSON>. Saturday's hearing will be to consider bond and issues of diplomatic immunity, <PERSON> Weisberg </PERSON> said. The Yugoslavian embassy in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> issued a statement saying it was `` distressed that something like that could happen to a diplomatic officer and that any diplomat might provide grounds for such allegations.'' The embassy emphasized its desire for good relations with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and said: `` The Department of State made clear that the action was directed solely at the individuals named in the indictment and not against the Yugoslav diplomatic and consular missions in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Yugoslav </LOCATION> government. In <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> `` presented a demarche to the -LRB- <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> -RRB- <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> expecting explanation and additional information'' on the incident, according to a statement carried by the state news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tanjug </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bijedic </PERSON>, who became consul general in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> in 1985, is not protected by diplomatic immunity because the charges are that his actions were not official functions of the consulate, said <PERSON> Ana </PERSON> <PERSON> Marija </PERSON> <PERSON> Besker </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the embassy. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Customs Commissioner <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Raab </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bijedic </PERSON> may have been acting under the instructions of superiors, but said authorities had no evidence to that effect. `` I hope that this investigation will serve as a notice to other government agencies that the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bloc </LOCATION> is still desperate to get its hands not only on our high technology, but our hard currency,'' <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Raab </PERSON> said. The 21-count indictment said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> undercover agents gave nearly $ 1.5 million in cash to the five men to be laundered. The men, who believed the money came from organized crime and was to be used to pay for exporting restricted high technology and military equipment, helped conceal its origin by depositing the cash abroad, then wiring it back to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bank accounts, officials said. The charges detailed eight transactions totaling $ 1.47 million. In all the cases, money was carried to foreign countries, particularly <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>, and transferred back to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> electronically under the names of phony corporations, officials said. In at least one transaction, <PERSON> Bijedic </PERSON> provided the men with diplomatic stickers that forbade <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials from opening suitcases containing $ 500,000 in small bills, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. `` The use of diplomatic or consular pouches is a serious problem with respect to high-tech diversions and obviously, here now, it's been seen to be a possible money-laundering device,'' <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Raab </PERSON> said All five men were charged with violating currency reporting laws, the arms export and control act and conspiracy, customs officials said. Indicted were <PERSON> Bijedic </PERSON>, 52; <PERSON> Vjekoslov </PERSON> <PERSON> Spanjol </PERSON>, 31, a naturalized <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizen from <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>; Vinko Mir, 54, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> LBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Hubert </PERSON> <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON>, 44, of <LOCATION> Carrollton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>; and <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Card </PERSON>, 50, of <LOCATION> Chattanooga </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn </LOCATION>. If convicted, <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> faces up to 230 years in jail and a $ 10.6 million fine, officials said. <PERSON> Spanjol </PERSON> faces up to 100 years in jail and a $ 5.1 million fine if convicted, and <PERSON> Bijedic </PERSON>, Card and Mir face up to five years in jail and a $ 250,000 fine, officials said. Cole and Spanjol were being held in federal custoday in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> pending a bail hearing on Monday. Card, arrested Thursday night in <LOCATION> Chattanooga </LOCATION>, will be taken to <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> for a bail hearing after appearing before a federal magistrate, officials said. Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarmousakis </PERSON>, the case prosecutor, said Friday he expected that Mir and Card will all appear in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> federal court early next week.

 Five armed Soviet hijackers surrendered and freed a hostage flight crew Friday, ending a two-day drama that began when they seized a busload of children in southern <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION> and demanded a plane out of the country. The four men and a woman, who said they wanted to flee the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, stepped onto the tarmac at <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Ben-Gurion </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> carrying bags filled with rubles worth $ 3.3 million. The Soviet government paid the money as ransom for releasing the youngsters and a teacher. Once off the plane, the hijackers dumped the cash on the ground after being asked to show they were not carrying explosives. Soldiers then helped the hijackers scoop up the cash, and the five held tightly to the bags as they were led off to the <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kabir </PERSON> jail near <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>. `` They were five simple criminals with a lot of money who wanted to flee the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>,'' said Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Shomron </PERSON>, army chief of staff. `` They were people who wanted to fly out of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. That's why they kidnapped the bus with the children,'' said <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Nikolaevitch </PERSON> <PERSON> Yermilov </PERSON>, the flight engineer. Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> said the plane and the crew would be returned to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. `` The hijackers will be interrogated and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> will act according to international law,'' <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> said. He was quoted as saying later on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> that `` ... those who violated the Russian law'' will be returned to Soviet authorities. <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Allon </PERSON> <PERSON> Liel </PERSON> said he was not aware of any written Soviet request for extradition of the hijackers, but he added, `` I do n't see any reason why we would want to hold them.'' He said the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> did not have an extradition treaty. But he said both nations have signed international treaties on punishing and extraditing airplane hijackers. The hijacking came at a sensitive time in <LOCATION> Soviet-Israeli </LOCATION> relations, which gradually have been improving since <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> severed them during the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. The hijackers surrendered at 6:15 p.m. -LRB- 11:15 a.m. EST -RRB-, about 35 minutes after the <ORGANIZATION> Aeroflot </ORGANIZATION> Ilyushin-76 touched down, guided by Israeli air force jets. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials were on the runway, as was the head of a <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> delegation temporarily based in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, officials said. The surrender and release of the eight-member hostage crew ended a day of frantic diplomatic contacts involving <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The dramatic bid to flee the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> began Thursday in the Soviet city of <LOCATION> Ordzhonikidze </LOCATION> in the southern part of the Russian republic. `` A group of armed bandits hijacked a bus with 30 schoolchildren and a teacher and demanded a plane to deliver them abroad,'' <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Vlasov </PERSON>, head of the Soviet news agency <ORGANIZATION> Novosti </ORGANIZATION>, told a news conference in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. The official news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said the hijackers, armed with three pistols and an automatic rifle, `` demanded a huge sum of money and an airliner for a flight out of the country'' in exchange for the hostages. The bus was taken to the local airport, but there was not a big enough plane there so the hijackers took off from neighboring <LOCATION> Mineralniye </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vodi </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio said the hijackers included two Russians, two Armenians and a resident of the Ossetian Soviet republic near <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>. Army officials said they knew while the plane was still in the air that there were no Soviet Jews aboard. <PERSON> Vlasov </PERSON> said the hijackers said they wanted to go either to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. Israeli officials said <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> was also on the list. Flight engineer <PERSON> Yermilov </PERSON> said that during the flight the hijackers played cards and kept an eye on the crew, but did not threaten them. <PERSON> Shortl </PERSON> after the plane landed, army officials said, one hijacker came out and was met by two negotiators. Three crew members then emerged and joined the discussions, which ended with the hijacker giving up a handgun, the officials said. The rest of the eight-member crew then came out and the drama ended. An unidentified crew member told <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> that seconds before the surrender, `` one of the hijackers asked, ` Is this <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>?' When they heard <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, they said they would stay.'' Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Amram </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitzna </PERSON>, a senior army commander, said the hijackers demanded proof that they were in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. `` They said, ` Wait a minute, we want to see something in Yiddish, or at least a Star of <PERSON> David </PERSON>,''' he said. <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> told reporters that the hijackers had a sawed-off shotgun and four pistols, but did not use force once they landed. The last reported hijacking in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> was in March, when members of a family musical group from <PERSON> Sibera </PERSON> tried to seize an <ORGANIZATION> Aeroflot </ORGANIZATION> plane en route to <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION>. When the plane neared <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION>, a Soviet army assault team stormed the craft, reports said. Five of the hijackers, three other passengers and a stewardess were killed.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s national security adviser said Friday that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials will advance no new proposals and do n't expect any surprises from Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> at the superpower meeting next week on Governors Island, N.Y. Briefing reporters on the visit that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will have on Wednesday, Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Colin </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> looks forward to `` one final session with the general secretary to note the stable relationship that exists now, the improving relationship, and allow the vice president to continue to build on that relationship.'' He said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> contingent is ready for, but he does n't expect, any repetition of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s pattern of surprise at the hurried summit in <LOCATION> Reykjavik </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iceland </LOCATION>, two years ago. It was there that the Soviet leader caught the Americans off guard with sweeping proposals that included the virtual elimination of strategic nuclear arsenals. <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> applauded the recent Soviet decision to stop jamming broadcasts of the <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> and other Western programs, and he said that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials were heartened by the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>'s decision to release scores of refuseniks. But he said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> still wants to see the Soviet `` institutionalize'' human rights reforms. The three-star Army officer, who soon will be promoted to the rank of general and will return to active duty with command responsibility for all troops stationed in this country, was asked what <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials would do if <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> sprang a surprise reminiscent of <LOCATION> Reykjavik </LOCATION>. `` I do n't know that we have to ensure against a surprise,'' he replied. But <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> also said that `` We have seen them try to turn a flank from time to time.'' `` ... And I think we would be prepared to deal with any surprise that they might come up with, take it under advisement, without feeling that we're under any pressure during a ... two-and-a-half lunch period, to necessarily respond in a substantive way to something that had not been anticipated,'' he said. Deputy Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Petrovsky </PERSON> told a press briefing in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> on Friday that <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> are among the items <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> will discuss with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. <PERSON> Petrovsky </PERSON> said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s speech next week at the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> will detail `` the Soviet leadership's views on major issues of world development.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials were widely criticized in the wake of the summit in <LOCATION> Iceland </LOCATION>, which collapsed when <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> disagreed over the Soviet leader's demand that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> president substantially downgrade <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s Star Wars missile-defense program. <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> said that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials do not know why <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is traveling on to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> after leaving this country. `` I really would hope that he would recognize that until something is done with respect to the problem presented to us by <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, we will always have an irritant in our relationship,'' the national security adviser said. `` ... We can not go as far as we would like to go with respect to the solution of regional problems.'' <PERSON> Petrovsky </PERSON> said all the meetings on <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s trip _ which includes visits with <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and with Prime Minister Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> _ were related.

 <LOCATION> PORT-AU-PRINCE </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ A powerful army officer who had been indicted in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on drug-smuggling charges was killed earlier this month by poison, police said Friday. The ex-wife of Col. <PERSON> Jean-Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> earlier said he suffered a heart attack at his home on Nov. 6. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> was indicted by a federal court in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> earlier this year on charges of drug smuggling. Haitian ruler Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Prosper </PERSON> <PERSON> Avril </PERSON> forced him to give up his command of the powerful <ORGANIZATION> Dessalines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barracks </ORGANIZATION> in October and to retire. He died moments after eating pumpkin soup, launching a wave of speculation he had been murdered. <LOCATION> Port-au-Prince </LOCATION> Police Chief Col. <PERSON> Georges </PERSON> <PERSON> Valcin </PERSON> said Friday night that <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> died after `` absorbing a toxic substance'' which he did not identify. `` There was nothing in the leftover soup,'' he told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in a telephone interview. `` But be careful: it could have been in the plate, which was washed immediately afterwards.'' <PERSON> Valcin </PERSON> said a sample of <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>'s intestinal tract was analyzed at <LOCATION> Vidal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. He said the chemical substance that was found is under study. Police said nothing about who might have killed <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> or why. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>'s family and a medical source insisted immediately after his death that he had been poisoned. However, his ex-wife, <PERSON> Mireille </PERSON> <PERSON> Delinois </PERSON>, said he died of a heart attack. She was arrested the day after <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>'s death, but authorities released her Nov. 26 after a judge ruled her detention was illegal because no charge was filed. Meanwhile, a <LOCATION> Haitian </LOCATION> official said Friday that he hopes the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will not `` make a political affair'' of last month's arrest of a former-high ranking Haitian officer on drug charges Retired Col. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Leon </PERSON>, former general secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Haitian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>, was arrested on Nov. 18 in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> in possession of about $ 200,000 worth of pure cocaine, the <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> said. `` The Haitian government expects that justice will be done according to the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> laws in force with a sense of equity and without any attempt to make a political affair of the case,'' <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Degraff </PERSON>, the government information director, said Friday. <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> was forced into retirement after rank-and-file soldiers ousted former ruler Lt.

The Green River killer, so called because many of the victims' bodies were found near the Seattle-area river, preyed mostly on prostitutes or transients <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, commander of the <ORGANIZATION> Green </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> River </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, said there was no evidence to link the cases, and that it was routine for the task force to exchange information with other jurisdictions investigating serial killings. Another body was discovered Friday in <LOCATION> Dennis </LOCATION>, about 50 miles east of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bedford </LOCATION> on <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cod </LOCATION>, but <LOCATION> Bristol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> officials said they had no idea if it could be connected to the five bodies found in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bedford </LOCATION> area. The body, that of a 37-year-old man, was found next to a syringe and needle. Investigators had to suspend a search of the highway area because the trained dogs they were using were distracted by television camera crews, <PERSON> Pina </PERSON> said. A woman whose skeleton was found Tuesday had been reported missing in the summer and had been dead at least three months, <PERSON> Pina </PERSON> said. He said her name was being withheld until relatives could be notified. Three of the missing women were reported last seen in the <LOCATION> Weld </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> area, known by police as a center for local drug trading and prostitution in this fishing port of about 98,000 people about 50 miles south of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. `` Some of the missing people that possibly are going to be identified were in the community at some point, in the drug community or prostitution community,'' <PERSON> Pina </PERSON> said at a news conference. `` I do n't have a doubt that they are all related in one way or another, as to the commonality of how they died, where they died, the condition in which we found them and the locations in which we found them,'' <PERSON> Pina </PERSON> said. Investigators have `` loose suspects in the case, including men who had used prostitutes in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bedford </LOCATION>. `` We have some people we are looking at very seriously ... the question is, who knew all these people,'' he said. <PERSON> Pina </PERSON> said one victim was strangled. The cause of death in some of the others had been determined but he would not disclose those results. The remains of all five women are be sent to the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> for further examination to more accurately determine the cause of death and learn other details. <LOCATION> Pina </LOCATION> spokesman <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Gibney </PERSON> said police used searchlights Thursday night but found no evidence to help the investigation. They resumed searching Friday morning. `` We're hoping we found the last of them and we just have to put some of the pieces together,'' <PERSON> Gibney </PERSON> said. He said investigators believe the fifth victim was a woman because of the style of the clothing found, dungarees and a light shirt. He said the body was severely decomposed and may have been there a year. All of the bodies were so badly decomposed that none could be identified as female on sight, <PERSON> Gibney </PERSON> said. The first three were spotted by motorists who pulled over on the shoulders of the highways, authorities said. State police and the district attorney's office intensified their investigation after the third body was discovered Nov. 8 off a ramp from Interstate 195 in <LOCATION> Dartmouth </LOCATION>, not far from where the second body was found July 30. A German shepherd owned by <ORGANIZATION> Connecticut </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> joined <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> dogs in the search Tuesday and found the fourth body near the same ramp. The ramp is about two miles west of the Route 140 exit on the interstate. The dog turned up the fifth body less than three miles south of where the first body was discovered July 3. <PERSON> Pina </PERSON> has said the five bodies might be linked to the deaths of two suspected prostitutes from <LOCATION> Providence </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> R.I. </LOCATION>, whose bodies were found last spring near two interstate highways.

 Five men who fled <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> in the 1980 `` Freedom Flotilla,'' only to be imprisoned for crimes, were returned to their homeland Friday in the first deportations under a pact that set off fiery prison riots last year. The five handcuffed Cubans, watched by two guards each, took off from <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Municipal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> in a <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Marshal's <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727 that held about 50 people for the 90-minute flight to an airport near <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION>. The plane landed without incident, turned over the detainees to <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> authorities and returned to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Krovisky </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` Everything went smoothly,'' he said. The Cubans, the first of 2,500 the government wants to deport, had been kept at the federal prison at <LOCATION> Talladega </LOCATION>, 60 miles east of <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION>, pending a final ruling on deportation. The flight had been scheduled for Thursday, but was delayed when <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> asked for more time to prepare for the five, all of whom had committed crimes in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Three of the five lost a series of court fights in their effort to avoid going home. <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Vurstion-Wade </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman, said a number of officials were on the flight, including <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Talladega </ORGANIZATION> Warden <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Southerland </PERSON>, because `` we consider this a training exercise for the department. We hope to have many of these flights.'' When the Cubans got off the plane, Ms. <PERSON> Vurstion-Wade </PERSON> said, three of them `` knelt down and kissed the ground.'' The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials got off the airplane, Ms. <PERSON> Vurstion-Wade </PERSON> said, and exchanged documents and a manifest with the Cubans. `` All went as well as planned,'' she said. `` It was very organized, deliberate and very professional. There were absolutely no problems.'' She said about 20 Cuban officials met the five returnees and put them on a bus, but that she did not know where they were taken. During the flight, she said, the Cubans `` were described as very quiet. They remained handcuffed and shackled but not to their seats.'' The Cuban news agency <ORGANIZATION> Prensa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Latina </ORGANIZATION> quoted an <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> official as saying <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> authorities `` immediately began procedures to study -LRB- the detainees' -RRB- judicial situation.'' The dispatch, monitored in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, did not say where the Cubans were taken. `` One of them shouted, ` Viva Cuba!'' after getting off the plane, <PERSON> Prensa </PERSON> <PERSON> Latina </PERSON> said. `` The repatriation of the five prisoners is included in the migration accords signed by <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> in 1984 -LRB- but -RRB- interrupted by legal problems in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' the report said. It said the five had been declared `` undesireables'' by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> voted 8-1 Friday to reject an emergency request by three of the Cubans to remain in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Justice <PERSON> Thurgood </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> cast the dissenting vote, with none of the justices commenting. Attorneys for the three claimed they would be persecuted if sent home. The other two did not fight deportation. The deportations were the first since a 1987 agreement was reached between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> to resume the repatriations. That pact set off 11 days of rioting in November 1987 at federal prisons in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oakdale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La. </LOCATION>, with 125 people held hostage, one inmate slain, and heavy property damages to both institutions. As the riots ended, the <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> inmates were dispersed to other prisons, including 114 to <LOCATION> Talladega </LOCATION>. There have been no reports of any inmate resistance to the latest deportation proceedings. A federal judge at <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION> is to rule by Monday whether 10 other Cubans at <ORGANIZATION> Talladega </ORGANIZATION> will be deported. The repatriation program for 2,746 Cubans was suspended at <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>'s insistence in 1985 after 201 were returned. In the 1980 boatlift, about 125,000 people, some of them convicts or mentally ill, sailed illegally from <LOCATION> Mariel </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> wants to return as many as 2,500 of the remaining Marielitos either as `` excludable aliens'' or those convicted of serious crimes in this country. The five Cubans were <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Beitia-Socarraz </PERSON>, 28, who pleaded guilty to second-degree burglary; <PERSON> Onel </PERSON> <PERSON> Calzado-Garlobo </PERSON>, 43, convicted in 1982 of attempted sexual assault involving a 13-year-old girl; <PERSON> Rene </PERSON> <PERSON> Maurin-Oliva </PERSON>, 25, who pleaded guilty to theft and battery; and <PERSON> Hector </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez-Quesada </PERSON> and <PERSON> Angel </PERSON> <PERSON> Meneses-Hernandez </PERSON>, who did not fight the deportation and about whom little was known. In <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Carla </PERSON> <PERSON> Dudeck </PERSON>, coordinator for the <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> to Support Cuban Detainees, said Friday's deportations likely will open the gates for more. `` The legal suits we filed did n't work,'' she said. On what treatment the deportees might face in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, she said, `` All we have to base it on is those who went back in 1985. About a third are still in jail and we do n't know why or what they are doing there. `` <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> called them traitors to the revolution when they left the country, then in 1984 he said those who came back would be treated humanitarily. It's hard to take all he says literally and it's hard to get information -LRB- from <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> -RRB-.'' The deportation agreement calls for up to 100 Cubans a month to be returned. About 500 detainees remain in custody among the 2,746 that <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> agreed to take back in 1984, Ms. <PERSON> Dudeck </PERSON> said. The others have been paroled. Some of the 500 still have appeals left open to them.

 Share prices soared to a record close on the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> Saturday as the market expressed relief from the threat of a interest rate hike, dealers said. The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues gained 133.25 points, or 0.45 percent, to close Saturday's half-day session at 29,665.50, its highest closing ever. The main economic barometer opened the week's trading with a major setback of 380.27 points Monday, but soared in later trading days to close 301.91 points, or 1.02 percent, above last week's finish `` Players were somewhat cautious until the release of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> unemployment rate yesterday -LRB- Friday -RRB-, and that seemed to have prevented the upsurge of share prices even though the market sentiment is still quite bullish,'' said a dealer at <ORGANIZATION> Nikko </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. He said Saturday's gain reflects the relief the market felt from worry that the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> may raise interest rates to calm the heated economy and fear of inflation. `` But with the slight increase in the jobless rate, the anxiety appeared to have been eased for the time being,'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> released a report Friday showing the American jobless rate for November increased to 5.4 percent from October's 5.3 percent. Volume on the first section of the exchange, where most major shares are listed, was estimated at 600 million shares. The previous Nikkei high was reached Wednesday when the index closed at 29,578.90 points. The foreign exchange market is closed on Saturdays.

 <ORGANIZATION> Long </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Island </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lighting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s board of directors said Friday it would consider a proposed agreement to sell and close the <LOCATION> Shoreham </LOCATION> nuclear plant despite the Legislature's failure to approve the deal But the board reaffirmed that it would not renegotiate the agreement and would `` vigorously'' continue to pursue a full-power license from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission. The <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> failed to meet a Thursday deadline on the agreement, which calls for the state to buy the $ 5.3 billion plant from <ORGANIZATION> LILCO </ORGANIZATION> for $ 1, then close it. In return, the utility would be granted yearly rate increases of roughly 5 percent for the next 10 years. Legislators opposing the settlement said it placed an unfair burden on ratepayers. The <ORGANIZATION> LILCO </ORGANIZATION> board said Friday that if the settlement is approved before the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> grants a 25 percent or full-power operating license, the utility would stick to the agreement unless `` the passage of time has materially disadvantaged <ORGANIZATION> LILCO </ORGANIZATION>'s shareholders or customers.'' The utility said that because the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> missed the deadline, it would ignore the part of the agreement restricting it from operating the <LOCATION> Shoreham </LOCATION> plant above 5 percent power, if the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> authorizes higher operation. In <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION>, Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> LILCO </ORGANIZATION> officials had exercised every option open to them. `` What did they give the state and the Legislature? Nothing,'' <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> said. `` If I were their attorney, I would be very proud of what I've done here today and I'd be saying to them, ` Look, I got you everything.''' <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Catacosinos </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> LILCO </ORGANIZATION> chairman and chief executive officer, said the board was disappointed by the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION>'s inaction `` We believe it is important to end the controversy surrounding <LOCATION> Shoreham </LOCATION> so that <ORGANIZATION> LILCO </ORGANIZATION> and state and local officials can work together to resolve the energy shortages on <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Catacosinos </PERSON> said. Legislators maintain that a settlement could still be approved within the next few weeks. <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> said his administration would continue to oppose the <ORGANIZATION> NRC </ORGANIZATION> licensing. The Shoreham plant was completed in 1985, a decade late and at seven times the original estimated cost. It has been prevented from operating at full power because the state and <LOCATION> Suffolk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> county </LOCATION> refuse to join in emergency evacuation planning. The plant, located on the northshore of <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> about 90 miles from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, is now licensed to run at up to 5 percent of full power.

 Loyalist soldiers battled mutinous troops with mortar rounds and rifle fire Friday at an army base outside the capital, and the government later said the two-day rebellion appeared at an end. The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said the soldiers staged their rebellion because they were angered by the resumption of trials on human rights violations of fellow officers. The government reported one rebel killed. DyN, an independent news agency, said several rebels also were wounded. No government casualties were reported. Vice President <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> said rebel leader Col. <PERSON> Mohamed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Seineldin </PERSON> gave up Friday night. `` Col. <PERSON> Seineldin </PERSON> has made himself absolutely responsible for the episodes, and has subordinated himself'' to the army command, <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> told reporters as he walked out of <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> following a meeting with the defense minister and army chief. `` There was no type of negotiation,'' he said. <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> said rebels remained holed up at an infantry school on the sprawling <LOCATION> Campo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mayo </LOCATION> base outside the capital. He said that <PERSON> Seineldin </PERSON> agreed to try to convince them to accept defeat after loyalists fired a few mortar rounds near the school, fatally wounding one rebel. The mutineers fired automatic rifles at the loyalists. At least four army tanks entered the base, according to the reports. Rebels who planted mines at the infantry school entrances began removing them after <PERSON> Seineldin </PERSON> asked for a truce. `` The insubordinate soldiers at the infantry school at the <PERSON> Campo </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Mayo </PERSON> now accept the orders of the army chief,'' Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Dante </PERSON> <PERSON> Caridi </PERSON> said in a ministry communique. A spokesman for the rebels said <PERSON> Caridi </PERSON> and <PERSON> Seineldin </PERSON> `` agreed to a truce of two weeks'' during which `` no sanctions will be taken against anyone.'' The rebel did not give his name nor explain what he meant by a truce. One officer died during the exchange of gun and mortar fire between the two sides, the official news agency <ORGANIZATION> Telam </ORGANIZATION> reported, and five people were injured, including a 19-year-old woman who was shot in the neck and stomach as she walked near the base. The soldiers seized the infantry school on Thursday. `` This is not a coup against the government, but a fight to restore military honor to the army and review the trials that punish the just and promote the guilty,'' <PERSON> Seineldin </PERSON> had told reporters inside the base. Civilian trials of officers accused of human rights abuses during the 1976-83 junta-ruled military dictatorships are resuming. <PERSON> Seineldin </PERSON> said he commanded 400 soldiers, and he apparently also commanded 53 coast guard men who deserted their base Thursday. The coast guard men drove onto the infantry school grounds Friday. Loyal troops had surrounded the school but held up attacking in the apparent hope of avoiding bloodshed. It was the third such rebellion in less than two years and army commanders nationwide affirmed their loyalty to the civilian government. President <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> had made no reference to the military rebellion in his address to the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> on Friday. On his way into <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> headquarters, the president appeared unconcerned about the mutiny and commented in <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> that his troops would `` suffocate'' the uprising. He told the assembly that if developed nations want to encourage democracy in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, they ought to provide debt relief so new democracies are not overthrown by tyrants. `` Unsatisfied expectations generate desperation, which always favors the adventures of the authoritarians,'' <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON>, whose election in 1983 ended military rule that began with a coup in 1976, flew to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Thursday evening and conferred with President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> at <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s home. <PERSON> Alfonsin </PERSON> will return home Saturday. Army insurrections in <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> had occurred in April 1987 and January 1988. Officers have grumbled for months at selections for promotions and retirements, a military budget that has shrunk by half in recent years, and pay that has not kept pace with 332 percent inflation since Jan. 1.

 A fugitive mental patient sought in three <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> killings demanded to see actor <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Landon </PERSON> before fatally shooting two Universal City movie studio guards, authorities said Friday. <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> <PERSON> Trupp </PERSON>, 42, wounded in a shootout with deputies Thursday near <LOCATION> Universal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> studios, told paramedics that God had ordered him to kill someone. He had been freed from a psychiatric hospital by a court ruling 11 months ago, officials said Friday. `` Prior to the shooting, the suspect went on the <ORGANIZATION> Universal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studios </ORGANIZATION> tour,'' said Sgt. <PERSON> Ernie </PERSON> <PERSON> Roop </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> sheriff's spokesman `` He asked several studio employees if he could talk to <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Landon </PERSON>, but was denied access.'' <PERSON> Trupp </PERSON> asked the guards if he could use the telephone in their guard shack to contact <PERSON> Landon </PERSON>, star of `` Highway to Heaven.'' <PERSON> Roop </PERSON> said <PERSON> Trupp </PERSON> left when a guard told him to use a pay phone, then returned and began shooting. One guard died instantly, and the other died Friday. <PERSON> Trupp </PERSON> was wounded minutes later in a shootout with deputies near the 420-acre Universal Studios production and entertainment complex near downtown. `` A paramedic said the suspect said he was told by God to shoot somebody,'' said county fire Capt. <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Mutch </PERSON>. <PERSON> Trupp </PERSON> also was heard to scream `` Help me! Kill me!'' as he was strapped onto a gurney. <PERSON> Landon </PERSON> could not immediately be reached for comment. A message was left on an answering machine for the actor-producer's publicist. Trupp, who also is accused of killing three people in an <LOCATION> Albuquerque </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.M. </LOCATION>, bagel shop Tuesday, was involuntarily committed to <ORGANIZATION> Trenton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Psychiatric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> on Nov. 25, 1987. A court later ruled he posed no threat and ordered him released to a supervised boarding house in February 1988, said <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> <PERSON> Risi </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jersey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>. However, <PERSON> Trupp </PERSON> fled a Trenton-area boarding house on April 5, one day after arriving, she said. He was listed in serious but stable condition Friday at <ORGANIZATION> Saint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Joseph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Burbank </LOCATION> with wounds to his chest and abdomen, said spokeswoman <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>. `` One of the charges he will face will probably be murder,'' said Deputy <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Hom </PERSON>. `` As soon as he is able, he will probably be moved to the jail ward at County-USC Medical Center.'' Security guard <PERSON> Jeren </PERSON> <PERSON> Beeks </PERSON>, 27, of <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Crescenta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, died at the scene. Officers said he was shot three times in the head. The second guard, <PERSON> Armando </PERSON> <PERSON> Torres </PERSON>, 18, died Friday at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Joseph </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in nearby <LOCATION> Burbank </LOCATION>. Officers said he was shot once in the head and twice in the body. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON>, an engineer at the entertainment complex, said he heard the shots but assumed they were from the `` Miami Vice'' live entertainment show for tourists. `` When you hear gunshots in a studio, you do n't associate them with murder,'' he said. <PERSON> Trupp </PERSON> was unemployed and lived off a $ 100,000 inheritance, said <LOCATION> Albuquerque </LOCATION> police, who were looking for him in connection with Tuesday's bagel shop slayings. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilt </PERSON>, 39, his wife, <PERSON> Jeanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilt </PERSON>, 37, both of <LOCATION> Albuquerque </LOCATION>, and the woman's father, <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Famiglietta </PERSON> <PERSON> Sr. </PERSON>, 63, of nearby <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rancho </LOCATION>, were killed when a man opened fire in the store.

<HEAD>British Endorse Mixed Catholic-Protestant Schools in Northern
Ireland</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By EDITH M. LEDERER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The British government has officially endorsed the idea of bringing Roman Catholic and <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> children together in the classroom as a way of bridging the sectarianism that bloodies <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. The headmaster of one such integrated school told recently of one classroom incident that led him to believe the initiative might at least bring better understanding between the feuding Catholic and <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> communities in the <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> province. The incident involved an <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> funeral in March, when two British soldiers were dragged from a car and killed at the cemetery. <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> students came to class in anger afterward. `` Here was your acid test for integrated education,'' said the headmaster, <PERSON> Terence </PERSON> <PERSON> Flanagan </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Lagan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, where <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> children 11 to 17 years old learn together. `` The students talked about it and while they did n't agree ... they realized there was a difference of opinion and they did n't feel they had to go for one another.'' Historically, education in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> has reflected the province's divisions: more than 99 percent of youngsters attend either state schools, which are almost entirely Protestant, or church-run Catholic schools. But after decades on the sidelines, the government took a landmark decision Oct. 5 to endorse integrated education like that at <LOCATION> Lagan </LOCATION>. The reason, says the province's education minister, Dr. <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Mawhinney </PERSON>, was that a growing number of parents _ one-third, according to a recent poll _ wanted it. Integrated schools, part of a wider program by Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s government to encourage cross-community contact, is the key element of the biggest shakeup of Northern Irish education for 40 years. As a sign of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s official backing for the reforms, Princess <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> visited <ORGANIZATION> Lagan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in late November and talked with the students. The reforms, expected to become law by 1990, will for the first time also require all children to study the same course material in all subjects. Schools now can develop their own courses. While they are similar because students take the same national exams, <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> schools tend to focus more on Irish history and writers while <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> schools favor English history and literature. <PERSON> Mawhinney </PERSON> said working parties would be set up to chart a common curriculum. But that wo n't be easy, since key episodes of Irish history are highly contentious. The Battle of the <LOCATION> Boyne </LOCATION> in 1688, for instance, is a glorious event in <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> minds, because it established <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> hegemony in <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. To Catholics, it was a disaster. But, according to <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Glendinning </PERSON>, a teacher at a <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> school, students tend to absorb a neutral version of history while simultaneously continuing to believe myths that directly conflict with the facts. `` The facts and myths that kids hold on to are two entirely separate areas,'' he said in an interview. Said <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Nobel </PERSON>, an 18-year-old student at the Protestant Grosevenor high school: `` However much we all pretend that we're objective, it's still in you _ you still have a bias You grew up with it.'' <PERSON> Mawhinney </PERSON> stressed that the government had no intention of forcing integration, since <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>'s population distribution makes it impossible to set up integrated schools in some areas. Only 1,000 of the country's 350,000 students now attend integrated schools. <PERSON> Mawhinney </PERSON> predicted the percentage will increase but said the government was n't setting any targets. `` Integrated education is not a panacea for <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>'s future,'' <PERSON> Mawhinney </PERSON> said in an interview `` Nevertheless, as more children go through the process, it's bound to have an effect on society and we think that effect will be positive and make it easier to tackle the political and security and economic problems that this province faces. Criticism from both Catholics and Protestants has been muted so far. <PERSON> Monsignor </PERSON> <PERSON> Colm </PERSON> <PERSON> McCaughan </PERSON>, director of the Council for <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maintained </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Schools </ORGANIZATION>, said he had no objection to parents voluntarily sending their children to mixed schools, but did not believe integration would solve the province's difficulties. `` I think society itself has to be integrated before there'll be any real change,'' he added. `` Political affiliations play a much stronger role than religious affiliations.'' <PERSON> McCaughan </PERSON> said it was impossible to integrate schools in the urban ghettos where violence is most prevalent and where religiously mixed classes might be most beneficial. The main opposition from the Catholic church and from some Protestant politicians is the government's plan to give financial preference to integrated schools. <PERSON> Mawhinney </PERSON> said the government wants to provide `` a very small element of retrospective justice'' to integrated schools, which do not qualify for government support until they have proved themselves viable over a period of several years. <PERSON> Flanagan </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Lagan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, founded in 1981 and the oldest of the province's integrated schools, was not a `` social experiment'' or the answer to <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>'s problems, but a symbol of what is possible. `` Young people can live together, their parents can live together and they do n't just have to be nice, middle-class parents who play golf and go to rugby clubs,'' he said. `` It can be done and we are showing the way.'' <PERSON> Flanagan </PERSON> said students will leave <LOCATION> Lagan </LOCATION> as mildly or as militantly Protestant or Catholic as when they arrived, but `` capable of understanding, respecting, the point of view of the other person because they know that other person as a person.''

<TEXT>
 In the unstable world of acting, <PERSON> Tess </PERSON> <PERSON> Harper </PERSON> has come to appreciate a sure thing. `` It's hard to establish a routine as an actor,'' said <PERSON> Harper </PERSON>, who broke onto the movie scene five years ago playing opposite <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Duvall </PERSON> in `` Tender Mercies.'' `` You can only be certain that this job is going to end and you're going to have get another one. That's why people go into soap operas or television series: It's safe.'' So when playwright-actor <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Shepard </PERSON> offered her a part in the comedy-drama `` Far North,'' which he wrote and directed, <PERSON> Harper </PERSON> accepted without even reading the script. `` It was just the thrill of being asked by him because I respect his opinion greatly. I felt honored that my capabilities matched up to his writing,'' she said. <PERSON> Harper </PERSON>'s journey to <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> began in <LOCATION> Mammoth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ark. </LOCATION>, with detours through <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Mammoth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, where she lived until leaving for college in the late 1960s, has a population of just under 1,200. `` I certainly knew where the road leading out of town was, but I left reluctantly,'' she recalled. `` You grow up in a place where nothing ever changes and the thing you become most afraid of in your life is any change.'' But since leaving her hometown, <PERSON> Harper </PERSON> has faced changes, many changes. She attended <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Missouri </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>, moved to <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> and became involved with the local theater. `` Sometimes I directed, sometimes I was the stage manager,'' she recalled. `` The thing about doing that type of theater is you're involved on every level You might have the lead in one show and work box office the next.'' In the early'80s, <PERSON> Harper </PERSON> moved to <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, determined to further her career. After making commercials and industrial films, the casting director for `` Tender Mercies'' spotted her and recommended that she be tested for the young widow who falls in love with a country-and-western singer -LRB- <PERSON> Duvall </PERSON> -RRB-. `` It was like winning the lottery,'' said <PERSON> Harper </PERSON>, now a resident of <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION> `` -LRB- Director <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Beresford </PERSON> and <PERSON> Duvall </PERSON> treated me as if I knew precisely what I was doing. If they had any doubts, they kept it to themselves.'' <PERSON> Harper </PERSON>'s lucky streak continued when she landed a small role in the enormously successful `` Silkwood,'' which starred <PERSON> Cher </PERSON>, Meryl Streep and <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Russell </PERSON>. She has also appeared in two TV miniseries, `` Chiefs'' and `` Celebrity,'' and the film `` Flashpoint.'' In 1986, <PERSON> Harper </PERSON> appeared in the movie adaptation of <PERSON> Beth </PERSON> <PERSON> Henley </PERSON>'s play, `` Crimes of the Heart,'' which starred <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> Keaton </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON> <PERSON> Lange </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sissy </PERSON> <PERSON> Spacek </PERSON> as the eccentric <PERSON> McGrath </PERSON> sisters `` ` Crimes' was summer camp and we had such a great time with each other,'' said <PERSON> Harper </PERSON>, whose portrayal of the meddlesome cousin <PERSON> Chick </PERSON> earned her an Academy Award nomination for supporting actress. `` I think it was easier for me because I was the only supporting role and here were these three women in the leads. Every time those women work anywhere you have to watch because their work is so exceptional,'' she said. <PERSON> Harper </PERSON> developed close friendships with <PERSON> Lange </PERSON> and <PERSON> Shepard </PERSON>, who also had a supporting role in `` Crimes,'' and was happy to have the chance to work with them again. `` I knew it would be a really good working relationship. You form a community. If you trust the people you're with then you know the community is going to be there.'' In `` Far North,'' <PERSON> Lange </PERSON> and <PERSON> Harper </PERSON> are sisters, who battle each other and their father -LRB- <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Durning </PERSON> -RRB-, as they struggle to find direction in their lives. `` What I liked about the character was her anger. I've always played very sane, very earthy characters. The character of <PERSON> Rita </PERSON> is n't focused at all. She's taking a break from her life.'' Something <PERSON> Harper </PERSON> can directly relate to. `` I've done it, but it does n't last very long. My ability to pity myself has about an eight-week limit.'' Although <PERSON> Harper </PERSON> thinks of acting as a `` joyful experience,'' she confesses to usually coming down with a strong case of nerves before starting any film. `` There comes a time before shooting or rehearsals where I panic and think I'm no good and the project's no good. But if you're lucky, the feeling does n't last very long. And how nervous could she be about making `` Far North,'' with <PERSON> Shepard </PERSON> writing and directing and <PERSON> Lange </PERSON> co-starring? Well, the actual story was just fine, but <PERSON> Harper </PERSON> worried about getting it on film because of weather conditions in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> where the movie was shot. `` Hopefully everytime you walk on the set, you're going to learn something from somebody,'' the actress said. `` I would be perfectly happy to do <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Shepard-Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Beresford </PERSON> films for the rest of my life.''

<HEAD>America's Favorite Acting Preppy Takes to the Stage</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Herrmann </PERSON>, <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s favorite acting preppy, is once again wearing a suit and tie onstage, but that's an occupational hazard when you're thin and well-educated and take naturally to the look. `` I can wear a suit; it's the kiss of death,'' joked <PERSON> Herrmann </PERSON>, who dons one nightly opposite <PERSON> Alec </PERSON> <PERSON> Guinness </PERSON> in Lee Blessing's two-character play `` A Walk in the <PERSON> Woods </PERSON>,'' now at the Comedy Theater He plays an American arms negotiator named <PERSON> Honeyman </PERSON> strolling through the woods of <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> enmeshed in talks with his Soviet counterpart, <PERSON> Andrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Botvinnik </PERSON>, played by <ORGANIZATION> Guinness </ORGANIZATION>. `` I do n't know how I got stuck in this preppy mold,'' said the actor, who specializes in playing the clenched, close-to-the-chest emotions that go with <PERSON> Honeyman </PERSON>'s starched, well-heeled appearance. He played similar types as T.S. <PERSON> Eliot </PERSON> in the 1984 play `` <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> and Viv'' and as <PERSON> Brock </PERSON>, the stuffy upper-class Briton, in <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Hare </PERSON>'s `` Plenty,'' opposite <PERSON> Kate </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelligan </PERSON>, for which both he and <PERSON> Nelligan </PERSON> received <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> nominations He played <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> Delano </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON> in two TV movies, with <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> as <PERSON> Eleanor </PERSON>. `` I did n't go to prep school. If anything, after playing FDR, I was afraid I was going to be typed in comedies, loony comedies,'' said <PERSON> Herrmann </PERSON>. <PERSON> Herrmann </PERSON>, 45, turned up for an interview at a <ORGANIZATION> Chelsea </ORGANIZATION> pub dressed in the natty style his latest role demands. `` The character in the play wears a tie, and there's a value in keeping in the clothes you are going to play in,'' he said. He took the role solely for the chance of acting opposite the great Guinness, having turned down offers to do it at the Yale Repertory Theater in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Haven </LOCATION>, and on Broadway last February. `` When I heard Sir <PERSON> Alec </PERSON> wanted to do it, it was something I wanted to put my hat in the ring for,'' said <PERSON> Herrmann </PERSON>. `` The way <PERSON> Alec </PERSON> does it, it's just a charmer.'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Prosky </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Waterston </PERSON> performed `` A Walk in the Woods'' for four months in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, where it received a Tony nomination for best play. The British production, directed by <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Eyre </PERSON>, received mixed reviews for the writing but near-raves for the stars. <PERSON> Herrmann </PERSON> is contracted for six months plus a British tour if Guinness is willing. A <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> stage veteran, <PERSON> Herrmann </PERSON> won a 1976 <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> for `` Mrs. <PERSON> Warren </PERSON>'s Profession'' at <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. He appeared last winter with <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Pacino </PERSON> and <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheen </PERSON> in `` <PERSON> Julius </PERSON> <PERSON> Caesar </PERSON>,'' the second in <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Papp </PERSON>'s series of Shakespeare productions at the Public Theater. All three actors, and the production itself, were panned. <PERSON> Said </PERSON> <PERSON> Herrmann </PERSON>: `` I was crushed. I'd been vain about my ability to speak blank verse because I really could, -LRB- and -RRB- the other guys did n't know what it was.'' But after the reviews, he said, `` I banged my head around for a long time.'' He has been banging about on-screen, as well. A familiar movie face for over a decade, he appeared in `` A Little Sex,'' `` Annie'' and `` Reds'' and, more recently, in `` Overboard,'' `` The Lost Boys,'' and the <PERSON> Bette </PERSON> <PERSON> Midler-Lily </PERSON> <PERSON> Tomlin </PERSON> comedy `` Big Business.'' The latter movies offered the chance to play `` three absolutely whacked-out people,'' especially the role of a vampire in `` Lost Boys.'' `` People asked, ` Are n't you afraid of playing a vampire?''' he recalled. `` Are you kidding? I'd kill to play a vampire. It was great.'' <PERSON> Herrmann </PERSON> likes equally working in movies and theater. `` Acting is acting. It's just the way you pitch it,'' he said. `` In a movie, the room is the size of the room. On the stage, the room is the size of the stage. It's a question, I think, of technique rather than difference in kind. You just have to use a different set of muscles.'' <PERSON> Herrmann </PERSON> studied on a Fulbright scholarship to the <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Music </ORGANIZATION> and Dramatic Art in 1968-69. `` <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> has had a big influence on my life; I feel very at home here,'' he said. `` They listen much better here. They're keyed to language. `` -LRB- But -RRB- that has its dangers. They've seen so much theater, they may not be aware you're trying something really new. They may expect a performance to fit a certain pattern.''

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> is living up to his promise to produce high-quality, original programming for his new <ORGANIZATION> TNT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>. The prestigious premiere of such programming is `` A Man for All Seasons,'' making its debut Wednesday and starring <PERSON> Charlton </PERSON> <PERSON> Heston </PERSON>, <PERSON> Vanessa </PERSON> <PERSON> Redgrave </PERSON> and Sir <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Gielgud </PERSON>. The screenplay was written by three-time Academy Award winner <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bolt </PERSON>, based on his play. Bolt won Oscars for `` Lawrence of Arabia,'' `` Dr. Zhivago'' and the 1966 film version of `` A Man for All Seasons.'' He also wrote the screenplays for the films `` <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>'s Daughter'' and `` The Mission. Besides best screenplay, `` A Man for All Seasons'' won Academy Awards for best picture, best actor -LRB- <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Scofield </PERSON> -RRB- and best photography. It would be reasonable to wonder, why would anyone want to remake such a success? But this interpretation, nicely directed by <PERSON> Heston </PERSON>, merits the effort; it is faster and wittier, closer to the play. For instance, it restores the dramatic stage device of The Common Man -LRB- <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kinnear </PERSON> -RRB-, a comic character who whispers to the other characters and directly addresses the audience. `` It was our goal to be the first to film the play as originally written,'' said producer <PERSON> Fraser </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Heston </PERSON>, the actor's son. The story surrounds the conflict between King <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> VIII </PERSON> and Sir <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> More </PERSON>, one of the king's most trusted advisers. More loses his position and eventually his life, because he refuses to surrender his personal convictions even in the face of public duty. `` Individual versus social responsibility is the constant question posed in a democratic society,'' <PERSON> Heston </PERSON> says, according to <ORGANIZATION> TNT </ORGANIZATION> publicity. `` Because the play makes an unavoidably contemporary statement, it is truly a play for all seasons. When <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bolt </PERSON> sat down to write ` A Man for All Seasons,' God must have whispered in his ear.'' <PERSON> Heston </PERSON>, like some other older actors, has been reduced of late to guest-starring on night-time soap operas and TV movies. He obviously relishes this juicy role. The movie was shot in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> at <LOCATION> Pinewood </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Studios </LOCATION> and at historical locations, including <ORGANIZATION> Hampton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palace </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> VIII </PERSON>'s home. The movie was filmed in a brief 19 days, a feat made possible by the fact that <PERSON> Heston </PERSON> and most of the cast, excepting <PERSON> Redgrave </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gielgud </PERSON>, had just completed a sold-out run of the play in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Redgrave </PERSON> is superb as feisty Lady <PERSON> Alice </PERSON> <PERSON> More </PERSON>, an ultimately tragic figure who loses everything because of her stubborn husband. <PERSON> Heston </PERSON> and <PERSON> Redgrave </PERSON> had worked together on the stage in `` Macbeth'' a decade ago. <PERSON> Gielgud </PERSON> is in the movie only briefly as <PERSON> Cardinal </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolsey </PERSON>, who dies early in the story. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Chamberlain </PERSON> does his best as <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> VIII </PERSON>, but next to the taller, charismatic <PERSON> Heston </PERSON>, he is n't as imposing as he should be. As the story opens, <PERSON> Wolsey </PERSON> warns More he'll be expected to support <PERSON> Henry </PERSON>, in defiance of the pope, in seeking a divorce from his wife, <PERSON> Catherine </PERSON>, because she can not produce a male heir. More, a devout <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION>, decides to avoid a conflict by not commenting on the matter. But ultimately, the king views his silence as condemnation. Early in the film, <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> comes to More's home. `` Why does Your Grace need my poor support?'' More asks. `` Because you are honest,'' the king says. `` And more to the point, you are known to be honest.'' <PERSON> Lady </PERSON> <PERSON> Alice </PERSON> is concerned that her husband has irreparably angered the king. `` Set your mind at rest,'' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> tells her. `` This is not the stuff of which martyrs are made.'' Eventually, however, More carries his convictions to the executioner.

 In their latest and most likely final offer, the management of <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> offered shareholders $ 8 billion more for their shares than in their first offer. What is $ 8 billion? Among other things, it is the asset value of a company the size of <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mining </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, including about 180 plants and 370 sales offices and distribution centers in 49 countries. Or it is the assets of <ORGANIZATION> Georgia-Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which owns or has cutting rights to 5.6 million acres of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> timberlands _ plus <ORGANIZATION> Morton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the aerospace contractor, and a few hundred million dollars in change. Had shareholders accepted the first offer, which was publicized as being in their interest, they would have, so to speak, left that much on the table. It is because of such mind-boggling considerations as these that aspects of the <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> sale will be debated well into the next century, and perhaps as long as business schools exist. Did shareholders get a fair deal? It would seem so, since the stock leaped in a few weeks from $ 55 a share to more than $ 90. But even after such good fortune, some shareholders might not be as happy as you might think. A good many <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> shareholders were long-term investors with an eye on the steady dividends of 5 percent or so a year, which they had expected to continue well into the future. These investors were not traders or sellers. <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> was, to them, a source of income. Suddenly, they have capital gains taxes to pay which, when combined with state taxes, could approach 40 percent. What does the precipitous sale of an established company mean to holders of bonds? Big losses. <PERSON> Bonds </PERSON> purchased when the company's debt position was strong have, inevitably, lost value as the company becomes burdened with debt The questions drive at the very meaning of a company. Is a corporation a dynamic, ever-changing institution whose value _ to its immediate owners or to society at large _ lies in its unique ability to produce products and services? Or is it to be viewed as a static entity, like a consumer product on a shelf, to be sold, and in the selling lose all its future value as a creator of change, a payer of dividends, an employer, a taxpayer, a producer? How is the <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> management to be viewed, or in fact the management of any company that promises to serve the shareholders, creditors, employees and customers, but which plots to take the company for its own portfolio? The meaning of `` insider trading,'' a term used commonly to describe those outsiders who gain access to inside information and use it for their own financial gain, might have to be reconsidered. Consider that prior to making their announcements, buyout managements use privileged information to construct their offer. They allow investors to buy bonds, knowing that those bonds will fall in value on their announcement. Is it proper for management to arrange for the continuance of their salaries, plus benefits, bonuses and lucrative pensions should they fail in their takeover attempt and instead fall prey to a hostile offer? Is an insider takeover and dismantling a proper end for a thriving company built on the savings, sacrifices and ingenuity of entrepreneurs, the millions of man-hours of labor, the years of risks, the hard times conquered? In comparison, what sacrifices, ingenuity, labor, risks and hard times are incurred by a management that benefits from its failure, i.e. that puts the company on the block because it thinks it might be better dead than alive? The debate is only beginning.

<DATELINE>GUAYAQUIL, Ecuador (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 This muggy port city has become the base of operations for Colombian drug gangs that are turning tiny <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION>, a nation of just 10 million people, into a crossroads for the world cocaine trade. In the last two years the amount of Colombian cocaine flowing through the Andean nation en route to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> has increased dramatically, according to Ecuadorean narcotics police and the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- DEA -RRB-. Officials also fear <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s drug barons are seeking to use <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION> to launder their huge cocaine profits and to invest in legitimate enterprises. `` The enormous profits from drug trafficking have converted it into an octopus whose tentacles are threatening to strangle <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION>,'' President <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Febres </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordero </PERSON> said in May, three months before his term ended. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>, head of <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> operations in <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION>, estimated that 30 to 50 tons of cocaine will have been smuggled into and out of <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION> by the end of this year. `` Just in the first six months of this year, there's been over 5 tons of cocaine seized in other countries that we know came through <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> said in an interview. The significance of the figures can be seen in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> estimates that 72 tons of cocaine are consumed annually in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s drug lords have diverted much of their cocaine through <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION> after narcotics officials in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> began searching Colombian planes and ships more thoroughly, say police and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> drug officers. <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION> is wedged between <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> on the northwest shoulder of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> is the world's largest grower of coca leaf, the raw material of cocaine; <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> is home to the drug cartels that control the world's cocaine trade. `` If you put pressure on in one place, the traffickers have to go somewhere else, and <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION> is handy,'' <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> said. `` They've been using it for a while anyway to get coca paste from <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> for processing.'' The seizures of pure cocaine smuggled in containers aboard freighters from <LOCATION> Guayaquil </LOCATION> this year include: _ 5,129 pounds discovered in a chocolate shipment at <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, in June It was the largest cocaine seizure ever made by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities outside <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. _ 2,860 pounds discovered by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> federal agents in April in <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Everglades </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla </LOCATION> It was buried in a shipment of frozen fruit pulp to prevent detection by dogs trained to sniff out drugs. _ 759 pounds found hidden between the wood paneling of prefabricated walls shipped in March to <LOCATION> Barcelona </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> It was one of the largest seizures of cocaine ever made in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Since 1986 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> customs officials also have seized five Ecuatoriana cargo and passenger planes that have landed in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> with cocaine hidden aboard. The state-owned airline has had to pay more than $ 4 million in fines to gain the release of the planes. `` <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION> is beginning to feel the breath of the Colombian mafia,'' said Col. <PERSON> Gustavo </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallegos </PERSON>, head of <ORGANIZATION> Interpol </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION>. The menace of the mafia also is seen in the attempt to convert <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION> into a major money-laundering country. `` Because of its bank secrecy laws, this is an ideal place to launder drug profits,'' <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> said. Ecuadorean bankers estimate that $ 200 million to $ 400 million in cocaine money will have entered <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION> by the end of this year, either for laundering or for investment in legitimate businesses. `` That's a lot of money coming into a small country like <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION>. It can have a corrupting influence,'' <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> said. Newspapers have complained in recent editorials about Colombian drug money corrupting judges and driving up the price of real estate. Tracking down the source of the money is complicated by the fact that investments by apparently legitimate Colombian companies have also increased sharply in the last few years. <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION>'s largest brewery is among the most recent and prominent of the Colombian purchases. Some 120,000 Colombian tourists are expected to visit <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION> this year, making it hard for <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION>'s narcotics police to keep track of suspicious visitors. `` Colombian traffickers enter here easily with false identities. They buy property, open businesses,'' <ORGANIZATION> Interpol </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Gallegos </PERSON> said in an interview in <LOCATION> Quito </LOCATION>, the highland capital. `` Once they are set up, with everything in legal order, they begin to export cocaine.'' Authorities are investigating some 20 <LOCATION> Guayaquil </LOCATION> export companies bought by Colombians in the past year, including the firm that shipped cocaine in containers of chocalate to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Febres </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordero </PERSON>, the former president, is credited by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> narcotics officials with destroying nearly all the coca plantations that Colombian cocaine traffickers tried to set up several years ago in remote jungle regions bordering <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials are confident <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION>'s new president, <PERSON> Rodrigo </PERSON> <PERSON> Borja </PERSON>, and his police officials will try to `` outperform'' the <PERSON> Febres </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordero </PERSON> government in the drug war. `` They see narcotics as a threat to the stability of the government,'' he said. `` It does n't take any genius to look next door to <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> to see the disastrous effects the cocaine trade has had on those countries.''

<HEAD>East Germany Launches Censorship Drive Against Soviet Reforms</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GIRARD C. STEICHEN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, once the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s staunchest ideological ally, has embarked on an unprecedented campaign of censorship aimed at bridling the spread of the Kremlin's new reform policies. The seriousness of the campaign became clear Nov. 20 when <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s Communist government slapped a first-ever, open-ended ban on a Soviet publication, a magazine called Sputnik. The campaign has pitted <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s aging and conservative leaders in the most dramatic form yet against reformers in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, whose re-examinations of Soviet history have led to a public debate on a scale unheard of in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. East German leaders have long resisted President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policy of glasnost, or openness, and other reforms, on grounds that such critical discussions of problems in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> are unnecessary. Recent speeches by <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leaders have reiterated the government's rejection of the Soviet reforms course. However, the recent actions have signaled the boldest moves yet by the government to distance itself from the debate in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and to insulate the nation's population from the popular changes. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policies enjoy enormous support among East Germans who hope his influence will bring about change in one of <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s most tightly controlled societies. East German party leaders have occasionally blocked the distribution of newspapers from <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact neighbors in the past _ during the 1968 <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Spring </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> and the early periods of labor unrest in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. Selected issues of Soviet magazines have also been blocked. But until the decision on the monthly magazine Sputnik, no outright ban had ever been imposed on a Soviet magazine. The decision was followed quickly with an order removing five Soviet films dealing with Stalinist themes from theaters across the country. Authorities also canceled an <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> cabaret production that poked fun at the government's reluctance to accept <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reform policies The banning of Sputnik followed its publication of articles critical of the late <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s communists before <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON> took power in <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> in 1933. <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>, who died in 1953, holds a special place in official <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> as a liberator in World War II and as the Soviet leader who helped found the new communist nation in 1949. East German leaders were outraged over an article in Sputnik's October issue that suggested that <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> `` had been a mere puppet of <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'' after the two nation's signed a mutual non-aggression pact in 1939 and that <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s communists had indirectly aided <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s rise to power by not `` joining together with Social Democrats'' to stop The Sputnik article also charged that German communists followed `` Stalin's order to stop all anti-fascist propaganda'' after the pact was signed. <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> invaded the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in 1941. Distribution of the October Sputnik was ordered halted shortly after it appeared in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. `` These -LRB- historical -RRB- issues go to the very root of their -LRB- communist East German leaders' -RRB- existence,'' said <PERSON> Stefan </PERSON> <PERSON> Heym </PERSON>, a prominent East German author, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. `` These -LRB- articles -RRB- upset the picture of the world they want to depict.' <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>, the East German leader, along with a substantial number of the nation's ruling Politburo members were members of the prewar German <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and pride themselves on having fought fascism. <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> was imprisoned by the Nazis and thousands of communists were slain. Shortcomings of the movement or of party leaders at the time have not been a matter for debate in the East German media. In an article defending the Sputnik ban, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> organ Neues Deutschland charged that the publication `` not only distorts Soviet history, but the history of the German <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>.'' `` The magazine, and we say this openly, defames German communists.'' While carefully emphazing that Sputnik was `` not an official organ'' of the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Neues </PERSON> <PERSON> Deutchland </PERSON> added that `` distorted visions of Soviet history, distributed here, are incompatible with our friendship with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>.'' Soviet officials defended the magazine, saying it `` mirrors a plurality of opinion in the Soviet press.''

<HEAD>A Strategic Arms Nudge, Not a Breakthrough, Is What's Expected</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY SCHWEID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Diplomatic Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, who have made arms control history together, are bound to revisit their idea of a dramatic reduction in strategic weapons when they meet over lunch this week, but a nudge forward, rather than a breakthrough, is the most that's likely to result. The strategic arms reduction treaty that they have been talking about _ the hoped-for centerpiece in <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s arms control program _ has too many holes in it for <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to reach command decisions during their three-hour luncheon Wednesday on Governors Island in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>. Moreover, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is well aware that he is dealing with a lame duck president who will have six weeks left in office and will be in no position to commit his successor, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, to any course of action. For all that, <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kampelman </PERSON>, the chief <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arms control negotiator, finds it difficult to believe arms will not come up during lunch. `` I believe it will come up,'' <PERSON> Kampelman </PERSON> said in an interview last week. `` But I do n't believe it will come up in a negotiating context. My own judgment is it will come up as a discussion and maybe a quick review of where things stand now.'' <PERSON> Kampelman </PERSON> added: `` And I guess perhaps an expression on both sides they hope to finish the work. I can not myself envisage any detailed discussion of the arms negotiations taking place.'' The unfinished treaty will be turned over to President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s administration with, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> side hopes, a renewed commitment from <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to maintain its current high priority. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> intends to raise arms control issues with the Soviet leader, just as he will bring up the suspended <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> withdrawal from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and the human rights situation, officials say. But the vital ground work simply has not been undertaken this time. For example, Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> did not have a planning session with Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> to set an agenda and to define the issues for their leaders. Arms negotiations were adjourned in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, on Nov. 15 and the two sides have not met since. They ended the 10th round of talks agreeing to an early resumption in 1989. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> subsequently proposed Feb. 15. The Soviets did not respond. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> probably will have <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> and a handful of other senior <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials at the luncheon table with them. But the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet arms control experts who normally labor over the details while the leaders hold their summits plan no such sessions. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> has predicted a `` substantive'' discussion. Another <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official, mindful of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s innovative style, remarked, `` You never can tell.'' But the hard fact is that the treaty to reduce <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet armories of long-range bombers, missiles and submarines by 30 to 50 percent is still mired in disagreement on several key points. The two sides have not decided, for instance, whether to include mobile missiles or sea-launched cruise missiles. Both are extremely hard to track. That means cutbacks are hard to verify. The room for cheating is uncomfortably wide. The Soviets, meanwhile, still would like to restrict <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Initiative </ORGANIZATION> as part of a treaty deal The $ 4 billion-a-year program is designed to stop ballistic missiles in space, but critics here and in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> say it could extend the arms race to a new and dangerous sphere. Then there is the fact a new <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> administration is coming aboard, one that may not share the outgoing administration's views on reducing strategic weapons. <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON>, designated by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to be his national security adviser, is worried that large cutbacks in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> strategic weapons could make the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact's edge in conventional forces in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> more significant. He also is concerned that reducing the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arsenal of land-based intercontinental ballistic missiles could expose those that remain to a higher risk of being destroyed in the event of a Soviet attack. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will be at the table, deferring to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. `` It will be President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s meeting,'' he said. And yet <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> will be aware that, in a sense, he will be speaking also for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and should not commit his successor to positions he may not want to take after Jan. 20.

<HEAD>Huge Grain Surpluses Could Be Just Around the Corner</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDS: Stands for Weekly Farm.</NOTE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Huge grain surpluses resembling the ones that ushered in the rural crisis of the early 1980s could be just around the corner despite current drought-reduced supplies, warns a leading government economist. `` The drought has altered the immediate outlook, but in a world of subsidized agriculture, the long-term tendency to overproduction lurks only slightly below the surface,'' said <PERSON> Ewen </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, undersecretary of agriculture for economics. Because of the summer drought, the world witnessed the steepest decline in grain stocks ever recorded, he acknowledged in remarks to the department's annual Agricultural Outlook Conference last week. The 29 percent plunge in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> grain production _ more than a third of the nation's corn and over half of the spring wheat crop _ turned markets upside down. Banished were surpluses and bargain basement prices. Tight supplies and steep prices became the rule. According to <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, however, the change has sent pessimists scurrying to the works of <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Malthus </PERSON>, the 18th century philospher who predicted almost 200 years ago that global population would outrun the planet's food supply. `` Today's Malthusians say that we have reached a plateau in agricultural productivity _ that the easy gains in crop yields have been won and that future gains will be diminished,'' he said. `` Furthermore they say that environmental degradation will further constrain productivity and that the advances of biotechnology are years away.'' In fact, said <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, farm productivity has increased 30 percent in the last decade alone. At that rate, farmers and the government will be wrestling with surpluses of 1.4 billion bushels of corn, 320 million bushels of wheat and 200 million bushels of soybeans, even if no land idled under the 1985 farm law is returned to production. `` There is little reason to believe that the pace of technological improvement in agriculture will slow in the years ahead,'' <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said. `` If anything, dramatic breakthroughs are on the horizon. Within the next few years, biotechnology will move from the laboratory into commercial use, potentially offering new plant varieties resistant to insects, heat, drought, frost and disease.'' `` The bottom line is that underlying fundamentals may have been masked but they have not been changed by the 1988 drought,'' he said. American agriculture has long been plagued by a chronic excess capacity, <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said. He cited a study by <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> which showed 9 percent excess capacity for all of the nation's agriculture in the 1980s and more than 20 percent for major program crops such as corn and wheat. `` The fact is, agricultural productivity continues to outpace the growth in demand for agricultural products,'' he said. `` The danger today is that policymakers will be misled by the present tightness in global grain supplies brought about by the drought.'' `` Analysts have always been swayed by conditions prevailing at the time they make their estimates, and they have frequently underestimated the capacity of farmers to expand production,'' he said. `` But history has demonstrated time and time again that when prices give the signal to expand output, farmers invariably respond.'' For a number of reasons, the rebuilding of stocks this time may be gradual rather than sudden, <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said. He cited an eventual removal of 40 million acres from production by the Conservation Reserve Program. The lower dollar sends <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> commodities overseas at a brisker pace. Growing economies overseas, especially in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rim </LOCATION> countries, represent expanding markets for American farm goods. `` Despite these caveats, I believe it would be a great mistake to ignore long-term fundamentals,'' <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said. `` Barring another drought, the odds are in favor of a rebound in production and a rebuilding of stocks.'' `` Even if this rebuilding is gradual, it underlines the importance of the reforms that have been proposed by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for agriculture in the Uruguay Round of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade negotiations,'' he added. In the talks, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has proposed a gradual phaseout of agricultural subsidies, a proposal that has thus far failed to arouse much enthusiasm in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. `` In the absence of such reform,'' said <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, `` it will be difficult to avoid a return to the costly and wasteful agricultural surpluses that have plagued us in the past.''

 Maybe it will be called the lunchtime summit. Maybe it will be called the ultimate power lunch. Maybe it will just be called a meeting.

It often has been the case that officials have been relucant to label such a meeting a summit beforehand, saying this would raise expectations that would not then be fulfilled. On the other hand, skeptics note that meetings that have been billed as non-summits have turned into full-fledged international confrontations fraught with consequence. <PERSON> Webster </PERSON>'s New World Dictionary defines summit as follows: `` in connection with diplomatic negotiations, the level restricted to heads of government.'' That would make the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> lunch a summit if there was any negotiating, but the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> insists there wo n't be. Officials say there are no plans for the working groups and expanded teams for plenary sessions that customarily accompany world leaders to a summit. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> tried to make the point four times in a 34-minute briefing on Nov. l4 that the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> session would not be the kind of high-powered conclave that <PERSON> Winston </PERSON> <PERSON> Churchill </PERSON> christened `` a parley at the summit.'' `` This would not be a summit meeting in any traditional sense,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. `` It's not a summit,'' he said. `` A summit would, by definition, I think have to be more prepared,'' he said. `` This is just a very cordial meeting to say hello and goodbye, if you will,'' he said. As if all this were n't enough, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> himself chimed in within the hour, saying, `` That is n't anything in the nature of a summit meeting,'' and, `` I can only tell you it is not going to be a summit.'' Two weeks later, Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> described the session as `` a meeting at the summit.'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, however, noted that the meeting was expected to last less than three hours and added, `` I think it is pretty hard to characterize that as a summit at least in any traditional sense.'' Despite the White House assurances, it was hard to forget that both the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet sides claimed beforehand that the Reagan-Gorbachev meeting in <LOCATION> Reykjavik </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iceland </LOCATION>, in October 1986 was not a summit. But the meeting took up sweeping nuclear arms control proposals, ended in a wrangle over <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s Star Wars system of space-based missile defense, and has been called a summit ever since.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> are meeting Wednesday for the fifth time, at a luncheon in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. They will be joined at the table by President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the session `` will ensure that the momentum and continuity of the arms control talks are extended and it will reaffirm the relations between the general secretary and the new president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as we enter the decade of the'90s.'' Officials said subjects would include the suspended Soviet troop withdrawal from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> seeking assurances that the troops will be out on schedule. They said the agenda for arms control and human rights talks would also be raised. Here, in brief, is a look at the previous Reagan-Gorbachev summits.

 The two leaders met on Nov. 19 and 21, exchanging enthusiastic handshakes and champagne toasts before getting down to business. When the meeting was over, they had agreed to hold summits in 1986 in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and 1987 in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and to give impetus to arms control talks, aiming at 50 percent reductions in nuclear weapons. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said in advance of the meeting that he would press <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> on human rights and regional conflicts, but documents after the summit and statements by the leaders indicated little sign of movement. Agreements were reached on cultural exchanges, air safety, additional consulates, increased air travel and cooperation on energy. Both sides said they favored a complete prohibition of chemical weapons as well as destruction of existing stockpiles, a goal that still has not been reached although an international conference is forthcoming. The two sides failed to reach any agreement on <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wars </ORGANIZATION> plan of space-based missile defense, on extension of the Salt II treaty, on divided families or on a joint venture in space.

Spokesman <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Speakes </PERSON> said, `` We will be satisfied with the <LOCATION> Iceland </LOCATION> meetings if we accomplish better understanding.'' The meetings ended in misunderstanding, with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials proclaiming themselves `` deeply disappointed'' because potential arms agreements vanished when the two leaders reached an impasse on testing of Star Wars weaponry. The administration later sought to paint the outcome in brighter hues, with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> saying it left the superpowers `` closer than ever'' to an unprecedented cut in nuclear arsenals. Four months after the summit, the Democratic-controlled <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> said in a report that there remained `` an astonishing degrees of confusion surrounding what actually happened'' at <LOCATION> Reykjavik </LOCATION>. The report said sweeping <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> proposals for deep reductions in nuclear arms were presented without advance study by the Pentagon. Disagreement remains over the events of <LOCATION> Reykjavik </LOCATION>. On Nov. 15, the day plans were announced for the latest Reagan-Bush-Gorbachev meeting, the president was asked how the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would react if <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> brought proposals, as he did in <LOCATION> Iceland </LOCATION>.

<DATELINE>JABALIYA, Occupied Gaza Strip (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Children stop chattering when the Israeli soldiers come in their trucks and riot helmets. Young men grip stones and the faces of their elders grow grim. A year ago in this ramshackle refugee camp of tin shacks and crude concrete-block houses, Palestinians began their first sustained rebellion in 21 years of <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation. No end is in sight. More than 300 Palestinians and 11 Israelis have been killed. More than 7,000 Palestinians have been wounded. Of 20,000 arrested, nearly 6,000 remain in jail. The intefadeh, the Arabic word for uprising used even by the Israelis, has generated international sympathy and a new sense of purpose and identity among the 1.5 million Palestinians of the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. Although the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> did not start the rebellion, it has become deeply involved and a young underground leadership has been formed to direct the protest. An Israeli election was fought largely on policy in the occupied lands and the related question of how to achieve peace with the Arabs. The Palestinians declared an independent state, changing the situation irreversibly. On this day, schoolgirls were walking home when two trucks filled with soldiers rumbled by in the muddy street. The grins on the girls' faces disappeared and they fell silent, their faces blank. A 33-year-old man standing nearby, who said he had five children, was asked about the future for the 50,000 people of <LOCATION> Jabaliya </LOCATION>. `` The blood will keep flowing,'' he said. Hardly a day goes by in the camp without a teen-ager being wounded by soldiers who open fire on stone-throwing youngsters. On the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> it is much the same. The revolt has spread to the Arab sector of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, and in small ways to Arabs who live inside <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and are citizens of the Jewish state. For many Palestinians, the revolt is a source of both pride and dismay. The passivity of the occupation has ended but thousands of families have a son killed or wounded, or someone imprisoned. Israelis view the rebellion with fear or hatred. The cars of Jewish settlers in the occupied lands are stoned as they travel to their homes. Some respond with gunfire. Jews are afraid to go to the Arab sector of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, which the government has annexed as part of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s capital. Parliamentary elections Nov. 1 made clear that Israelis are deeply divided on how to deal with the Palestinians. Parties winning seats in the 120-member <ORGANIZATION> Knesset </ORGANIZATION> advocated every solution from trading occupied land for peace to expelling all Palestinians from the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dedi </PERSON> <PERSON> Zucker </PERSON>, a member of parliament for the left-wing <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>, sees an odd unity in this and said of the two extremes: `` In both cases, people do n't believe Israelis and Palestinians can live together in the current situation.'' Dozens of times in the past year, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> officials have interpreted a lull in the violence as evidence that the rebellion was waning, but each time the lull has passed. <PERSON> Ephraim </PERSON> <PERSON> Sneh </PERSON>, former head of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> military government, wrote in the newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Haaretz </ORGANIZATION> that, despite the toll taken on <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> society, `` it would be a mistake to assume it is incapable of sustaining the intefadeh.'' For most Palestinians, the question is not whether to continue, but with what tactics. <PERSON> Daoud </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuttab </PERSON>, a leading <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> journalist, sees the revolt at a crossroads _ pulled one way by those weary of trouble and frequent general strikes and the other by those who believe only violence will drive <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> from the occupied lands. <PERSON> Kuttab </PERSON> says the problem is to keep the revolt in the world's eye without making <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> angry enough to crush it by any means necessary. Palestinians in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> see the great achievements of the intefadeh as building their own pride and drawing attention to their plight, not only in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> but among their own leaders in <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. They believe television pictures of <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers shooting or beating young Palestinians have had a lasting effect. As for the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, for years it declared with overblown rhetoric that the Jews would be driven into the sea. Last month it issued a Palestinian declaration of independence based on a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> resolution that calls for creating Jewish and <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> states side by side. <PERSON> Hatem </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Ghazali </PERSON>, a community leader in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, sees this as a major accomplishment for Palestinians who live with the reality of <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation rather than with dreams of the past. `` We have shown international public opinion that we are looking for peace, not only the people but the leadership of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said, adding that the response from <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will increase Palestinian anger and frustration. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> called the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> declarations `` doubletalk'' intended to mask an aim of destroying <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in stages. Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> refused <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> a visa to address the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, and four days later two firebombs were hurled into the compound of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> consulate in Arab east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. They caused no damage. <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Ghazali </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Israeli responses provided `` a hearty ideological meal'' to those who want violence, but journalist <PERSON> Kuttab </PERSON> contended that more violence is not inevitable. He said the uprising's future will be decided by debate among Palestinians and throughout the world. In the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>, however, anger often outpaces hopeful thinking. The intefadeh began when an Israeli army truck collided with two Arab vans just outside <LOCATION> Jabaliya </LOCATION> on Dec. 8, 1987, killing four Palestinians and injuring six. Rumors spread that it was not an accident, but revenge for the slaying of an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> businessman three days earlier. Crowds gathered that night and by the next day hundreds of youths were throwing stones at <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers. Then as now, the soldiers opened fire. The first to die was <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatem </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Sisi </PERSON>, a 17-year-old high school student. The other day in <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> city just north of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, a 15-year-old named <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> spoke of what lies ahead for the rebellion. With his light brown hair, jeans and sneakers he could have passed for an American teen-ager, but what he said was: `` Either we will get our state or we'll fight. Some people are prepared even to kill Jews.''

 First Lt. <PERSON> Sheffy </PERSON> said he was torn apart emotionally after wounding a 12-year-old Palestinian boy with a plastic bullet. `` For two days, I could n't face myself,'' the tall, dark-haired company commander recalled. <PERSON> Sheffy </PERSON>, 23, said he and his companion on a two-man patrol fired on hundreds of stone-throwing Palestinians who ambushed them, wounding several. He estimated he had fired plastic bullets more than 100 times in three months of almost daily street battles. A rifle with a sniper scope was on the table in front of him. <PERSON> Sheffy </PERSON> says he has tried to block out his emotions so he can do the job, and `` now it's easier. I just do n't ask myself too many questions.'' `` I do n't see myself as a hero for shooting someone,'' he said, `` but I think it is necessary to keep the situation from getting even more violent.'' Second Lt. <PERSON> Doron </PERSON>, a platoon leader, said constant stress and face-to-face conflict with Palestinians make the soldiers short-tempered and prone to quarrel. `` I feel there is a tendency towards more violence,'' said <PERSON> Doron </PERSON>, who is 22 and comes from a kibbutz, or communal farm. `` It's difficult to act one way here and differently at home. <PERSON> Sheffy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Doron </PERSON> are first names. Army regulations prohibit the use of last names of soldiers serving in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. Some Israelis fear soldiers returning from duty in the territories will release their pent-up anger on civilians, both Arabs and Jews. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> is especially vulnerable to such side effects of conflict because virtually all men and women are required to serve in the military. Men do up to 62 days a year of reserve duty until age 49. <PERSON> Reuven </PERSON> <PERSON> Gal </PERSON>, former chief army psychologist who now heads the private <ORGANIZATION> Israeli </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Miliary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION>, said research indicates one effect of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s wars has been an increase in crime. He said that also could be a result of the year-long Palestinian uprising. `` I would not be surprised to see a sharp increase in crimes such as beating and assault,'' along with an increase in traffic accidents, he said. <PERSON> Gal </PERSON>'s wife <PERSON> Ivria </PERSON>, an author, wrote a poem about how service during the uprising changed her 20-year-old son <PERSON> Yoav </PERSON> from an anti-war activist to a tough-minded soldier. `` The pictures of my son the soldier, who attended Peace Now rallies with long hair and an earring, are on the front page of the newspaper, and he is described as a brute occupier,'' she wrote. `` My heart is torn because I know the soul behind that picture. I know the confusion and I know the pain.'' When her son came home for the weekend, the poem says, she washed the dirt from his clothes and treated his swollen feet, his blisters and cuts, `` but I cry and my heart goes to him because who is going to treat my son's internal wounds? Who is going to see the unseen wound?'' <PERSON> Sheffy </PERSON> and two of his platoon leaders spoke to a journalist in a tent near the maze-like public market of <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, a focal point for anti-Israeli violence since the uprising began Dec. 8, 1987. They said the army faced protests by thousands of <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> early in the intefadeh, the Arabic word for uprising that has been adopted even by Israelis. Today, most confrontations are on a small scale _ a foot patrol or army vehicle ambushed by half a dozen young Arabs who hurl stones or bottles of flaming gasoline and dart into an alley. Two soldiers from <PERSON> Sheffy </PERSON>'s elite infantry unit suffered severe head injuries and one was partially paralyzed by large blocks of stone dropped from rooftops. <PERSON> Saguy </PERSON>, a 22-year-old a second lieutenant, said men in his platoon often wanted to get even. `` I talk to them. I tell them that revenge is indiscriminate, that it will hurt people that have harmed no one,'' he said. Such frustration has led to several instances of attacks by soldiers on innocent bystanders. <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> radio said 45 soldiers and officers had been tried and 15 were convicted, receiving jail sentences that ranged up to a year for a manslaughter case. In November, for example, the army gave 21 paratroopers up to two weeks in jail each for going on a rampage after their bus was stoned in a refugee camp. The officer-cadets broke windows in 20 houses and damaged four cars. Critics say one of the main problems is that occupation duty normally is handled by specialized police forces, not young soldiers whose training is for fighting wars. `` There should be a permanent force that does n't change every three or four weeks,'' said <PERSON> Aryeh </PERSON> <PERSON> Shalev </PERSON>, former head of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> military government. `` We should free the army from this function. It's not a military job, it's a police job.'' The uprising caught the army unprepared. Soldiers did not wear helmets, did not have truncheons and were not trained in crowd control or the use of tear gas. The result was high casualties from live fire, which has accounted for 3,500 woundings and most of the more than 300 Palestinian fatalities. Soldiers interviewed in <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION> said they are better prepared for riots now because of new technology and a 10-day training course. They said the plastic bullet, introduced in September as a non-lethal alternative to live ammunition, has made them more feared in the street and eased their own frustration. `` The Arabs used to bare their chests and yell, ` Shoot me!' ` Shoot me!' knowing that we had orders not to shoot unless our lives were in danger,'' <PERSON> Saguy </PERSON> said. `` Now, we do n't need to do more than aim, and they disperse.''

 An increase in single-family home construction helped boost overall construction spending 0.9 percent in October, the fourth consecutive monthly increase, the government says. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday that building activity rose $ 3.7 billion to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $ 409.2 billion. Construction spending, which rose 0.7 percent in September and 0.2 percent in August, recently has bucked what has been a generally lackluster building trend over the past year.

 The possibility of lower crude oil supplies next year has sparked heavy futures market activity as investors move to add more to their inventories. On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the January contract for <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intermediate </ORGANIZATION>, the benchmark grade of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude, jumped 29 cents to settle at $ 15.61 a barrel Thursday. Other contract months also rose. Among refined petroleum products traded on the exchange, the January contract for unleaded gasoline rose 0.70 cent to settle at 45.98 cents a gallon, while other contract months ended the day mixed. Heating oil closed up 0.94 cent at 49.18 cents a gallon, and other contracts also rose. Analysts said fear of shorter crude oil supplies when the new <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> accord takes effect convinced investors to add more to their inventories. Energy brokers said trading volume was heavy with commercial activity particulary strong. Prices seesawed throughout the day as investors bought and sold futures and crude prices moved near $ 15.80 a barrel weekly high reached Monday after the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION> signed a new accord to reduce its output by some 4 million barrels a day next year. Traders noted that the January contract far outsold others amid expectations that oil supplies could be sharply curtailed if <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> acts on its agreement. Helping to boost prices was ongoing speculation that several non-OPEC oil producing nations would take an active role in helping the cartel shrink the world oil glut. `` There was talk that eight producers from non-OPEC countries would meet to discuss this,'' said <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Simard </PERSON>, oil broker with <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oman </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> are among the non-OPEC nations that have indicated an interest in reducing their own output, analysts said

 <LOCATION> WINSTON-SALEM </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ Dreams of big stock profits and the possible return of <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s corporate headquarters are being tempered by the specter of layoffs in this tobacco community, following the company's record buyout agreement. `` I think the general feeling is one of uncertainty,'' said <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Nordenholz </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Winston-Salem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>. `` There are lots of mixed feelings about what's happening.'' <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 24.53 billion buyout agreement with <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roberts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> means potentially big windfalls for the <ORGANIZATION> R.J. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> workers and others among the 9,000 area residents and groups that own an estimated $ 2 billion in <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> stock. Some local businessmen also see the possibility that <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> will move its corporate headquarters, which left <LOCATION> Winston-Salem </LOCATION> for <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> less than two years ago, back home again, bringing jobs and prestige. But at the same time, the company is being bought with unprecedented amounts of borrowed money, and locals expect subsequent belt-tightening in a number of <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> operations _ including the tobacco business _ that could include layoffs or other cutbacks affecting them. `` Some people are going to have greater personal wealth than ever before, and that's balanced by a certain amount of anxiety about where the company's headed and what's going to happen to their careers,'' <PERSON> Nordenholz </PERSON> said. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>, said stories of production-line workers becoming millionaires as stock prices nearly doubled in the past 50 days are `` a bit overstated.'' `` There are some people who are suddenly quarter-millionaires, on paper anyway,'' he said. But not many are packing up their bags for the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION>. Many local shareholders will see their gains as a sudden windfall, but others are looking to reinvest their profits, said <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, a managing partner of the investment firm <PERSON> Alex </PERSON>. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> and Sons. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> <PERSON> Spache </PERSON>, a maintenance technician at <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> quoted by the <ORGANIZATION> Winston-Salem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION>, said he had sold some stock earlier at $ 84 a share, far below the expected $ 109 value of the buyout but way above the $ 56 range the stock held before the bidding war began Oct. 20. `` I just wanted to be on the safe side,'' he said. `` I did n't want everything I had in speculation. Much of the impact on the community has been psychological. While many analysts have portrayed <ORGANIZATION> R.J. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's No. 2 cigarette maker, as the corporation's money-making machine, few expect the Winston-Salem-based company to go unscathed. But <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Weddle </PERSON>, director of <ORGANIZATION> Winston-Salem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said the impact of the buyout _ even with layoffs _ would be positive in his firm's attempts to lure other industry to the area. `` I am probably one of the few people alive who sees opportunity in employment reductions,'' he said. `` We have a fairly tight labor market for certain types of industrial skills.'' With local unemployment in the 3 percent range recently, it has been difficult to benefit from expansion in the export and manufacturing sectors, <PERSON> Weddle </PERSON> said. `` For us to share in that we must have all the available ingredients,'' he said. When the financial smoke has cleared, <LOCATION> Winston-Salem </LOCATION> could be in better shape than it was a year ago, <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said. `` Tobacco is fairly recession resistant, as is most of the food business,'' he said. `` Things may be tight for a year, 18 months. But profits have been in the 20 to 25 percent range. ... What are you going to do, lay people off because you're making more money? It does n't work that way.'' Some employees could have lingering bitterness against <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION>'s chief executive, <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said. It was <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> who moved RJR corporate headquarters to <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> and who kicked off the buyout war with his own offer to buy the company. `` If <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> had n't moved headquarters to <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, he'd have had everybody rooting for management,'' <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said.

<BYLINE>Retailers Have Slow November, But Signs Point to Good Christmas</BYLINE>

 A post-Thanksgiving pickup in sales by the nation's biggest general retailers is a positive sign for the important Christmas shopping season, industry watchers say, even though sales for all of November were sluggish. Sales tallied after the November reporting period _ which ended Nov. 26 for most retailers _ showed modest improvement, `` leading us to the general conclusion that Christmas sales will be reasonably healthy,'' said <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Feiner </PERSON>, a retail industry analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` Based on the end-of-the-month results, one could project we're going to have a moderately strong Christmas season,'' said <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Loeb </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stanley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Retailers earn about half their annual profits during the crucial holiday period. But even if sales are slow, profits should improve in the fourth quarter because retailers are keeping their inventories tight, <PERSON> Ronning </PERSON> said. Many analysts predict retailers will have a 6 percent overall increase in Christmas sales from last year. But <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Ronning </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Brown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harriman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, warned that the sales improvement might look better than it really is because results last Christmas were disappointing. November's sales `` were on the sluggish side, very similar to the trends we saw in September and October,'' said <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Edelman </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` The first 3 -LCB- weeks were quite soft.'' Retailers have had slumping sales for nearly two years as consumers have paid more for necessities and services and tried to reduce their high debt loads. Analysts and economists expect this trend to continue into 1989. Apparel retailers, who have had a year-long sales slide, continued their comeback last month. For example, <ORGANIZATION> Limited </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a leading specialty apparel retailer, reported its overall November sales rose 25 percent while sales at stores open at least a year _ known as same-store sales _ picked up 18 percent. The nation's largest retailer, <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Roebuck </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said its overall sales were up 8.8 percent last month and 6.2 percent for the first 43 weeks of the fiscal year. <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>' same-store sales rose 4.4 percent in November and 2.3 percent for the year so far. Retailers and industry analysts believe same-store sales are a more accurate measure of a company's performance than figures that include sales from new stores. Not all retailers report same-store sales. K mart <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said its overall sales were up 5.5 percent last month and 5.6 percent for the year to date. K mart reported its same-store sales rose 1.4 percent for the month and 1.9 percent so far this year. K mart's reporting period ended Nov. 23, so its sales report did not reflect the beginning of the traditional Christmas season on the day after Thanksgiving. <ORGANIZATION> Wal-Mart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said its overall sales rose 30 percent during November and 29 percent so far in 1988. The discount retailer's same-store sales were up 13 percent for the month and 11 percent for the year to date. <ORGANIZATION> J.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Penney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said its overall sales fell 1.8 percent during the month and were up just 0.1 percent over the cumulative 43-week period <PERSON> Penney </PERSON>'s same-store sales were off 3.8 percent during November, and slipped 1.1 percent for the year to date. <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sack </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Poor </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, said the decline in <PERSON> Penney </PERSON>'s sales reflected the fact that the company had discontinued several merchandise lines over the past year. <PERSON> Penney </PERSON> said it would have recorded a gain if sales from discontinued items were excluded from year-earlier results. <ORGANIZATION> Dayton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hudson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> reported its overall sales picked up 7 percent during November and 14.8 percent over the 43-week period. The company reported same-store increases of 1.5 percent for the month and 1.7 percent for 43 weeks. May <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said its overall sales rose 19.7 percent last month and 16 percent for the year to date. Same-store sales rose 2.8 percent in November and 1.9 percent for the year so far. F.W. <ORGANIZATION> Woolworth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said its overall sales picked up 9.3 percent last month and 11.8 percent during the 43-week period. Same-store sales rose 4.8 percent in November and 5.8 percent for the year to date. <ORGANIZATION> Montgomery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ward </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said its sales were up 7.8 percent in November and 3.7 percent for the 43 weeks. Sales for several of the big retailers continued to run well under the rate of inflation, which has increased by 4.6 percent so far this year. The results reported were from the biggest general merchandise and apparel retailers. Unlike monthly retail sales figures released by the federal government, they do not include sales at auto dealers, supermarkets or restaurants.

<HEAD>RJR Headquarters May Wind Up A Blip In Atlanta's Business History</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Less than two years after its much-heralded move to <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, the corporate headquarters of <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> may be moving again, leaving little mark on the city's business history. <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION>'s board of directors shocked their hometown, <LOCATION> Winston-Salem </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, in January 1987 by announcing the move of corporate headquarters to metropolitan <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. Wednesday, the food-and-tobacco giant's board officially picked corporate takeover kings <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roberts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> as the company's new owner. And <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> has said it would like to move <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION>'s headquarters back to <LOCATION> Winston-Salem </LOCATION>. Such a move would not have the impact on <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> that losing one of its other corporate giants _ such as <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> or Coca-Cola _ would have. <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> only brought some 300 headquarters employees to rented luxury office space in <LOCATION> Cobb </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, just north of the city. Most <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> workers in the <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> area are n't even at the headquarters. Among them are 750 at <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION>'s plant in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> community There has been no indication that <PERSON> Nabisco </PERSON>'s manufacturing operations in the area would be affected immediately by the <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> takeover Thus, <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> leaders took the idea of an RJR headquarters pullout in stride. `` We certainly have appreciated having <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION>'s corporate headquarters in the <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> area,'' <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said Thursday in a statement released by his office. `` Should they decide to relocate, I remain confident that the high-employment facilities in the <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> area will remain.'' In its nearly two years here, <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> has not become an integral part of life in the city for most Atlantans outside the big-business community. The company has no landmark presence, no giant tower on the city skyline. `` It's been a corporate presence,'' said <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, vice president for communications for the <ORGANIZATION> Atlanta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>. `` In the Fortune 500 ... they're very high, and that's been important for <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> to be perceived as a major headquarters city. `` But we still have the <LOCATION> Nabisco </LOCATION> presence here, and ... in economic impact, it would be minimal; there's only 300 employees in the headquarters that's potentially moving.'' <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> picked <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> as its new home primarily because of the business climate and the proximity to <ORGANIZATION> Hartsfield </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlanta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airport </ORGANIZATION>, one of the world's largest airports. <PERSON> King </PERSON> said those factors still might prompt <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> to stay. `` It remains to be seen what the final decision would be,'' he said. `` We think <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> has still got the same qualities that attracted RJR to this city in the first place.'' <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION>'s spokeswoman in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Polly </PERSON> <PERSON> Howes </PERSON>, said it was too early for headquarters staffers to talk about where they might be headed.

<HEAD>Pepsico Set To Buy General Cinema Bottling Operation</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Some analysts say <ORGANIZATION> Pepsico </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s planned acquisition of <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cinema </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s soft drink bottling operation will help increase efficiency in the business, putting downward pressure on soda prices. <ORGANIZATION> Pepsico </ORGANIZATION> and General Cinema announced the proposed $ 1.5 billion deal on Thursday. Analysts said the deal would bring General Cinema top dollar for the bottling operation, relieving some of the earnings and cash flow pressure the company has felt from a decline in its movie revenues and heavy investment in retailing, confectionary and tobacco companies. The move brings one of the nation's biggest independent bottlers under <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION>'s control, allowing the soft drink giant to consolidate bottling operations and reduce costs, industry analysts said. `` There are too many bottlers operating at inefficient levels. If <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION> can bring the production costs down, the competition in the industry will drive the retail price down,'' said <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Burry </PERSON>, a senior vice president at the Wall Street brokerage house of <PERSON> Kidder </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Peabody </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The company, headquartered in the <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Chestnut </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, owns and operates 1,359 movie screens at 318 locations throughout the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Earnings from the movie operations declined about 5 percent despite a slight rise in box office revenues in the fiscal year ended Oct. 31, <PERSON> Nardone </PERSON> said. General <PERSON> Cinema </PERSON> owns about 60 percent of the <ORGANIZATION> Neiman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marcus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, which consists of <PERSON> Neiman </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcus </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bergdorf </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON> and Contempo Casuals stores. It has announced plans to open 10 to 12 new <PERSON> Neiman </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcus </PERSON> stores by 1995. General <PERSON> Cinema </PERSON> also has bought about 18 percent of the stock in <ORGANIZATION> Cadbury-Schweppes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> since 1986, said company spokesman <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Nardone </PERSON>. General Cinema entered the bottling business in 1968 by acquiring <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beverage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which held <ORGANIZATION> Pepsi </ORGANIZATION> franchises in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> and northern <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. It subsequently purchased other franchises and now has regional bottling facilities in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Winston-Salem </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Twinsburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>; and <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> W. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>. General Cinema Beverages had preliminary revenue of about $ 720 million for the fiscal year ended Oct. 31 and expects operating earnings of about $ 93 million, the company For the quarter ended June 30, the company reported net earnings of about $ 36 million on revenue of about $ 631 million, more than double the profit from the year before. <ORGANIZATION> Pepsico </ORGANIZATION>, headquartered in <LOCATION> Purchase </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, had earnings of $ 595 million on revenue of $ 11.5 billion in 1987. It projects revenue of about $ 13 billion this year. Analysts said they expect the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cinema </ORGANIZATION> purchase to dilute <ORGANIZATION> Pepsico </ORGANIZATION>'s earnings by about 15 cents a share in 1989. The companies said the transaction is subject to the signing of a definitive agreement, clearance of antitrust laws and closing prior to the end of 1988.

Market forecasts anticipate the unemployment rate will be unchanged from its October level of 5.3 percent. Non-farm payrolls, which are often seen as a more direct gauge for economic activity, are expected to show a gain of 260,000. `` The market is only concentrated on the unemployment figures. They may reopen a new chapter for the dollar,'' said one corporate trader in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the British pound fell to $ 1.8498 from $ 1.8535 late Thursday. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, the dollar rose 0.07 Japanese yen to a closing 121.64 yen. Later, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it dropped slightly to 121.63 yen. Other mid-morning dollar rates in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, compared with late Thursday's rates, included: 1.7331 West German marks, up from 1.7300; 1.4525 Swiss francs, up from 1.4498; 5.9205 French francs, up from 5.9075; 1.9552 Dutch guilders, up from 1.9510; 1,281.75 Italian lire, up from 1,278.00; 1.1880 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1855.

<HEAD>Trade Groups Offer Differing Proposals On Solving Thrift Crisis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Two trade groups are calling for sharply different solutions to the savings and loan crisis, with one advocating abolishing S & amp; Ls as a separate industry and the other making preservation of the current system a priority. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutions </ORGANIZATION>, the smaller of the two lobbying groups, wants to abolish the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which backs individual deposits of up to $ 100,000 in S & amp; Ls. A proposal expected to be adopted by the council's board of directors on Monday says healthy S & amp; Ls should be permitted to transfer to the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which guarantees deposits in commercial banks. S & amp; Ls that ca n't qualify for transfer would have five years to become healthy or shut down. In the end, only one federal insurance fund would remain, regulating both commerical banks and savings institutions. There would no longer be institutions devoted exclusively to financing home mortgages. That's the opposite of recommendations released Thursday by the largest trade group, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutions </ORGANIZATION>. The league wants to preserve the separate regulatory system for S & amp; Ls and housing finance. The varied approaches are explained in part by differences between their memberships. About two-thirds of the council's members are called savings banks and are already insured by the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION>. Most of the rest have a good chance of qualifying for transfer. However, many of the league's members are not healthy enough to join the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION>. Both groups agree that the industry ca n't pay the $ 50 billion to $ 100 billion cost of cleaning up insolvent S & amp; Ls and that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the administration must find a way to pay. The council said <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> must use tax money, but argued for keeping <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L rescue spending exempt from Gramm-Rudman budget deficit requirements. The league said it will offer its funding proposal early next year. While the league is emphasizing the need to maintain a separate lending system for housing, it also advised against a significant rollback of rules permitting <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls in some states to invest in risky ventures far removed from home mortage lending. Instead, it advocates controlling abuses by requiring S & amp; L owners to put up more of their own money, or capital, when entering risky ventures. `` When people have their own capital at risk, they tend to act more responsibly,'' said <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> J </PERSON>. <PERSON> Levy </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Guaranty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> in </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Milwaukee </ORGANIZATION>, who chaired the league task force on the issue. Many analysts blame the industry's current problems in large part on institutions that strayed into speculative areas such as lending to commercial real estate projects, particularly in states with permissive laws, such as <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. The league said state-chartered <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls that used new investment powers wisely `` should not be penalized for the sins of those who have abused'' them. But Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and frequent critic of S & amp; Ls, warned, `` The days are over when the federal government will provide insurance and then permit a state regulator to allow those insured deposits to be put into anything under the sun. `` Overall the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> will get some sympathy in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> when they say we should n't tax the healthy thrifts into oblivion,'' <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON> said. `` But they're going to face far less sympathy when they resist the reform measures that are going to have to accompany taxpayer dollars.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, which regulates the nation's 3,000 federally insured S & amp; Ls, proposed a risk-based capital regulation on Monday that would be phased in by 1993 While not addressing that specific proposal, the league said `` provisions should be made where applicable for grandfathering,'' meaning that some institutions should be exempted from meeting the new requirements. The league did advocate curbing the growth of insolvent institutions, a measure already adopted by the bank board. It recommended tightening rules governing creation of new institutions and takeover of existing S & amp; Ls. It also wants better standards for appraising the property that secures loans. It said S & amp; Ls should be required to independently evaluate loans or parts of loans they purchase from other institutions.

<HEAD>Deficit to `Intrude Heavily' on Farm Policy, Outgoing Ag Chief Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Farm policymakers in the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration are going to find themselves sharply constrained by pressure to cut the budget deficit, says outgoing Secretary of Agriculture <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON>. `` You can not avoid having the problems of trade deficit and fiscal deficit intrude heavily on agricultural policy in the new administration,'' <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> said Thursday at <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s annual Agricultural Outlook Conference. <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> and two other panelists said as much as $ 3 billion may have to be cut from farm programs in 1989 to meet targets under the Gramm-Rudman deficit reduction law. Farm programs of the government's <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> currently cost about $ 13 billion a year, down from peak of $ 26 billion in fiscal 1986. The panelists suggested that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> might pass an extension of the farm law and postpone at least until 1991 any real overhaul of the current five-year programs expiring in 1990. <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> again said he will be leaving at the start of the new administration. Numerous possible successors have been mentioned, but thus far no word has come from President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> or his transition team. Farm programs approved in 1985 under the pressure of a large-scale rural crisis have proven highly popular, <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> said. `` I do n't think we would have any changes in farm programs if it were n't for budget pressures,'' he said. But `` You've got $ 3 billion to save in some shape or form and it's going to drive changes, I think, in 1989.'' Even so, there is no reason to think the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration will propose sweeping changes right away, said <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Daft </PERSON>, an agricultural economist and former <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> official. `` You do n't have to come forward with legislation right away,'' he said. He noted that farmers are not clamoring for any change. `` I do n't see any tractors across the street on the Mall,'' he said. `` If I were a new administration coming in, I'd say, why rush?'' he said. That only provides another reason for stopgap legislation, the panelists said. `` Particularly when you've got eight members of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> up for re-election'' in 1990, said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Lesher </PERSON>, a consultant and former <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> business partner also appearing on the panel. `` My guess as the secretary says is that it's at least a 50 percent chance'' that stopgap legislation will be approved, he said. <PERSON> Lesher </PERSON> told the panel there are only three ways to reduce farm program spending by $ 3 billion. He said one would be to lower target prices _ congressionally set price levels used in calculating income-support payments. Another would be to reduce the acreage base used in calculating payments, he said, and a third would be to cut the amount of acreage planted.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has unveiled a 1989 program for rice farmers with a national average price-support level of $ 6.50 for each 100 pounds. The support level represents an expected reduction from a national average of $ 6.63 in 1988. Price support loans are paid by the government's <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> to farmers who post their crops as collateral. Because producers are free to forfeit the crops and keep the cash, the system puts a floor under prices. Among program requirements that farmers must meet to qualify for federal subsidies, Secretary of Agriculture <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> announced a required acreage reduction of 25 percent. This represents land that farmers can not plant and is designed to prevent surpluses. <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> set the established target price at $ 10.80 for each 100 pounds, down from $ 11.15 this year. Target prices are used in calculating so-called deficiency payments that the government provides as income supports to participants in some programs. Other provisions of the rice program: _ Whole kernel milled rice price support rates were set at $ 10.81 per hundredweight for long grain and $ 9.81 for medium and short grain rice The broken kernel rate for all rice classes is $ 5.41. _ Producers who pledged 1989 crop rice as collateral for price support loans will not be permitted to purchase marketing certificates when repaying loans at the marketing loan repayment rate _ The discretionary inventory reduction program will not be implemented _ Farmers may sign up for the program between Dec. 19 and April 14

 Enrollments in colleges of agriculture at land grant universities are up this year, reversing a decade-long decline, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> says. `` This fall, undergraduate enrollments have taken a long awaited upturn at many agricultural colleges,'' said a statement from <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON>, administrator of <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s cooperative state extension service. `` At other schools, enrollments of agriculture majors have begun to stabilize after years of fewer and fewer ag majors.''

<TEXT>
 The 12 <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> leaders opened a two-day summit Friday to review progress toward creating a borderless, single-market <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> by 1992. Officials said the leaders would seek to reassure the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION>'s main trading partners, that their efforts to boost trade within the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> will not be at the expense of imports. A draft statement to that effect, says that a single EEC market will benefit also `` non community countries. 1992 <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> will not close in on itself ... will not be a fortress <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> but a partnership <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.'' About 12 hours before the summit began, four bombs exploded in <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> about 200 miles away, police said. No one was injured in the blasts that caused minor damage to buildings, including an EEC office. The Revolutionary Popular Struggle said it set off the bombs. The left-wing group has claimed responsibility for bomb attacks in the past. The <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> leaders, accompanied by their foreign ministers, began their meeting with a luncheon hosted by Greek Premier <PERSON> Andreas </PERSON> <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON>, the summit's host. On Friday morning, the leaders held bilateral meetings. Britsh Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> met with West German Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> and, officials said, they agreed it would be useful to have a summit meeting of the leaders of the 16 <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> nations in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> in either May or June. The <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> summit is held at the Knights' palace, a 14th century castle that is part of a medieval citadel overlooking the entrance to a small harbor that the colossus of <PERSON> Rhodes </PERSON> was once said to have straddled. The Greeks spent nearly $ 5 million renovating the massive 205-room castle which Italian dictator <PERSON> Benito </PERSON> <PERSON> Mussolini </PERSON> once planned to use as his summer residence. The Greek premier arrived Thursday leading a 150-member delegation. `` I feel optimistic about the summit. I think we can reach significant decisions that will be good for the Community and good for <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> said. The comment was apparently designed to remove fears <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> will press her case that the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> ` s single-market project must not lead to the creation of a central bank and a single currency. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> partners, however, feel that is the road the Community must take. Officials said the <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> leaders will have wide-ranging political discussions. They are expected to discuss, among other things, the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> and to issue a statement on East-West relations and the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION>'s role in world affairs.

<HEAD>Maxwell Launches Test Issue Of European Newspaper</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RHODES, GREECE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 British media magnate <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> on Friday launched a 12-page test issue of `` The European,'' his daily newspaper. <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> promised the newspaper would promote European unity and would in particular take aim at the `` old-fashioned, nationalistic'' views of <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>. <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> said the newspaper would begin daily sales on May 9, 1989, with the eventual goal of achieving circulation of at least 500,000 copies a day and probably between 600,000 and 650,000 copies. Speaking at a press conference held to coincide with the summit of <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> leaders on the Greek island of <LOCATION> Rhodes </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> said that his initial investment in the project would total between 20 million and 30 million pounds, the equivalent of $ 37 million to $ 55.5 million, with an additional 10 million pounds, or $ 18.5 million, for promoting the launch of the newspaper. <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> added that he was committing himself to investing in the newspaper for `` three to five years.'' <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> said that `` The European'' would sell at newstands for 40 British pence -LRB- 80 cents -RRB- and on the Continent for the equivalent of 5 French francs. <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> said that the newspaper's editorial position would champion European unity and actively oppose anyone who `` slows down progress'' toward such unity. `` We will support anything and anybody in favor of <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> unity,'' he said, taking particular aim at <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>. <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> criticized the British premier for opposing greater European unity in several areas, and singled out her opposition to British entry into the European monetary system as an `` idiotic position'' for which he claimed the <LOCATION> U.K. </LOCATION> is paying a `` devastating price'' in terms of high interest and exchange rates. `` She will fail in making <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> again miss the European bus,'' <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> said he also was in favor in principle of entry by other countries into the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION>, a more powerful <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> and the reunification of <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> said he foresees a staff of 200 to 250 journalists at `` The European'' with editorial centers in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Munich </LOCATION>. The paper will be published in every country in which circulation exceeds 30,000 copies. <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> said that in recent conversations with the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> he had informed <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> officials that he opposed investors `` such as myself'' having a `` stranglehold'' on several media in a single geographical market. <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON> said that he supported regulations limiting such power. <ORGANIZATION> Maxwell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communication </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. PLC last month acquired the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> publishing company <ORGANIZATION> Macmillan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> for $ 2.5 billion <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON>'s promotional test issue was a 12-page full-sized daily with news items and features from across <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, illustrated with both black-and-white and color photographs. The issue's editorial reflected <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON>'s opposition to Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s view of European integration. The editorial said that Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s opposition to monetary union in the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> has `` blighted hopes that progress towards the unity of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> was accelerating.'' The commentary piece added: `` Having haggled and hectored for years to reduce the cost of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s entry into <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, she has now deliberatly created a new hostility to the whole concept, which alarms and depresses <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s friends.'' <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON>'s newspaper carries its name in big bold letters across the top of the entire front page and below it, in smaller letters, is written `` Forward with <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>''.

 A nationwide mailing next week of 500,000 booklets to some autoworkers is the latest step in a joint AIDS education program run by <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> union. `` Our main message is that you ca n't get AIDS through casual contact in the workplace,'' said <PERSON> Maureen </PERSON> <PERSON> Moll </PERSON>, a consultant to the program. `` There's a lot of fear out there, and we're trying to educate people on how AIDS is transmitted and on what they have to do to protect themselves.'' The 36-page color, magazine-size booklet is to be mailed beginning Monday. It contains articles about helping a relative deal with the disease, how to tell children about acquired immune deficiency syndrome, understanding the disease in the workplace, research and financial help for victims and their families. <PERSON> Trish </PERSON> <PERSON> Houtteman </PERSON>, co-coordinator of the UAW-GM AIDS Education Program which developed the booklet, said <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> employees and their families account for about 2.3 million people, or about 1 percent of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> population. <PERSON> Houtteman </PERSON> said because of confidentiality rules, she does n't know how many <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> employees have AIDS. The <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> said this week it has received reports of 79,389 AIDS cases nationwide, resulting in 44,950 deaths. If federal projections about the growth of AIDS are correct and 1 percent of those people are <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> employees, <PERSON> Houtteman </PERSON> said, the automaker could be faced with insuring 2,500 AIDS victims by 1991. The cost of that could run into billions of dollars, said <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, the program's other co-coordinator. `` This was n't done just because of economics, I can assure you,'' said <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, assistant director of the <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's more a question of helping people. The booklet also contains frequently asked questions and answers about AIDS, a fatal disease that disables the body's ability to fight infections. The booklet is part of a larger program that also has included a conference by video in February among about 2,000 company and union officials, a nationwide mailing of a six-page booklet earlier this year and training for medical and safety personnel and counselors at all <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> plants.

 The `` Talking <ORGANIZATION> Silver </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rail </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION>'' toy train is being recalled because of a potential fire hazard, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Consumer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Product </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. The importer, New Bright Industries of <LOCATION> Canton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, had received 16 reports of the toys short circuiting and causing the tender car to overheat, with nine cases in which the train caught fire, the agency said. No injuries have been reported. Involved in the recall are about 38,000 of the toy trains with metal plug connectors between the tender car and the locomotive section. They were manufactured in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> in 1986 and were identified as Model 1170. Newer train sets carrying that model number, but having a plastic plug connector between the two cars, are not involved in the recall, the commission said. Owners of the recalled train sets can obtain a free replacement by calling New Bright Industries at 1-800-325-5630. <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> residents should call collect at 1-313-981-0020. Consumers can also write to New Bright Industries, 41911 <LOCATION> Ford </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Road </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, 48187.

 Interest rates jumped and stocks slipped today in reaction to a government report that the economy created 463,000 jobs in November and a record percentage of the American population was at work. The signs of economic growth were regarded as more significant than a slight uptick in the civilian unemployment rate, which rose to 5.4 percent from a 14-year low of 5.3 percent in October. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks dipped 8.53 points to 2,093.35 after half an hour of trading. The dollar was little changed in active trading. Ordinarily the dollar would rise in response to evidence of strong economic growth, but there was little buying interest. `` The market has totally and unequivocally ignored whatever positive news for the dollar there has been,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>, chief currency dealer for <ORGANIZATION> Amsterdam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rotterdam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The 0.1 percentage point increase from October's jobless rate was due almost entirely to a 560,000 increase in the civilian labor force _ the number of people either holding jobs or looking for them, the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said. The labor force had remained essentially unchanged from August through October and has grown by only 2 million people in the past 12 months, including the big gain in November, reflecting a tapering off of the Baby Boom generation entering the job market. Despite the slight increase in the unemployment rate, the government figures showed 116 million Americans holding jobs last month, or 62.6 percent of the adult population age 16 or over. Both are record highs, said Labor Statistics Commissioner <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Norwood </PERSON>. Strong employment gains raise fears that the economy will overheat and prices will rise. That hurts the value of fixed-income securities. The price of the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>'s benchmark 30-year bond fell 1 3-16 point, or $ 11.88 per $ 1,000 face amount. Its yield, which rises when the price falls, climbed to 9.13 percent from 9.02 percent late Thursday. There were rumors that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> would raise its discount rate to cool off the economy. Such a move would push up short-term interest rates in general, making the dollar more attractive to the world's investors. But the dollar was flat to slightly lower in hectic trading today, at about 121.3 Japanese yen and 1.73 West German marks. On Thursday, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said its main economic barometer indicated a possible slowing of the economy's expansion during October. It said its Index of Leading Indicators edged up 0.1 percent after falling the previous month. Analysts cautioned against drawing any firm conclusions until the index, used to forecast the economy's direction, established a consistent pattern. The index has declined in five of the past 12 months. It dropped a revised 0.3 percent in September, compared with the previous estimate of minus 0.1 percent. It also fell in July and May, but rose in June and August. When the economy is slowing, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> is less likely to move interest rates higher. The financial markets all but disregarded the leading indicators report, awaiting instead today's release of the November unemployment figures. Activity on all markets was light as many investors stayed on the sidelines. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks, up nearly 40 points over the past three sessions, fell 12.63 to close at 2,101.88. The dollar was little changed in foreign exchange trading. The bond market reacted positively to the leading indicators, with the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>'s key 30-year issue rising about $ 5 for every $ 1,000 in face amount. In a separate report Thursday, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said construction activity rose 0.9 percent in October to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of $ 409.2 billion, the fourth consecutive monthly increase. Strength was in most categories, but half the gain came in single-family homes, the department said. In other economic news, the nation's largest general retailers reported their sales continued at a sluggish pace in November, but an end-of-the-month surge was a positive sign for the Christmas shopping season.

<HEAD>Looking for a Few Good Retailing Stocks</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOYCE M. ROSENBERG</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Choosing a retailing stock these days is about as easy as finding the right Christmas gift for your hard-to-please uncle. There may be a wide selection to choose from, but it takes a lot of looking before you can settle on the right one. With a sales slump that has dragged on for nearly two years, the retailing sector has not been at the top of many investors' `` buy'' lists. The investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, for example, recommended last month that investors purchase just two out of 40 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> retailing companies. And as <PERSON> Stacy </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruchlamer </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said in an evaluation of the retailing sector in late November, `` selectivity is paramount.'' She recommended six out of 19 stocks. Retailing stocks fell out of favor well before the Oct. 19 market crash last year. Stagnant sales and stores' declining profits cast a pall on the entire sector, and when investors learned that fall 1987 fashion lines had flopped, they began dumping retailing issues. Things got so antsy that last November, when <ORGANIZATION> Wal-Mart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s sales were running about 8 percent ahead of year-earlier levels _ compared with the company's usual 13 percent _ several analysts slapped a `` sell'' recommendation on the discount retailer. And <ORGANIZATION> Wal-Mart </ORGANIZATION> was, and has been, a consistent star of the retailing industry, thriving when its competitors were stumbling. But some of the casualties are making a comeback. One of the most prominent examples is <ORGANIZATION> Gap </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The specialty apparel retailer's stock, which had peaked at nearly $ 78 a share in August 1987, had plunged to just under $ 37 by a month later. In two days alone, it fell nearly $ 19. Now, Gap is showing up on `` buy'' lists. <ORGANIZATION> Goldman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sachs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> analyst <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON>, in an analysis of Gap late last month, said the retailer `` is restoring its merchandising, financial and management credibility as a growth retailer.'' <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON> cited the company's new styles, which are generating improved sales, and its cost controls, among the reasons for his `` buy'' recommendation. According to the analysis, Gap has conquered some of the problems that plagued the retail sector last year by offering a wide selection of merchandise that is distinctive from the fashions offered by other retailers. One of the biggest complaints women had last year's was they saw the same styles in store after store. Gap's success is evidence of how retailers can, on an individual basis, reclaim their lost glory. But overall, the sector remains under a pall as long as consumers spend more money on necessities and services and less at shopping malls. With this gloomy reality, analysts and retailers alike are casting a very cautious eye on the Christmas shopping season. This is make-it-or-break-it time: Retailers earn about half their annual profits during the holidays. Although overall sales continued sluggish in November, analysts said a post-Thanksgiving pickup indicated the stores might have a moderately good season. No one, however, is predicting it will be great. The retailers generally have cut their costs and reduced inventory in recent months to preserve their profits. But as long as booming sales are a thing of the past, a winning retail stock could remain hard to find.

 Bendix-King has signed an agreement to provide federally required collision avoidance radar systems for <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. The multi-year agreement announced Thursday by the companies is valued at $ 100 million. It calls for Bendix-King to provide the systems for 600 planes.

Installation is expected to start late next year and be completed by the end of 1991 to meet a federal deadline for adding the systems, <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. The Bendix-King system lets commercial and corporate aircraft communicate automatically with each other, pinpointing location, altitude and direction. When another plane comes within five miles, the system's monitor will highlight its position, direction, altitude and ascent or descent. If the system determines that the plane is on a collision course, it will instruct the pilot _ both by synthesized voice and an on-screen graphic _ to descend, climb or hold present course.

<HEAD>Public Offering Substantially Over-Subscribed, Firm Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The offering of shares in state-owned <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> to private British investors was `` substantially over-subscribed,'' the investment firm organizing the sale said Friday. Applications were still being counted, but investors applied for far more than the 452 million <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> shares on offer to the general public, said <PERSON> Gillian </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakes </PERSON> of the British investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Samuel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Montagu </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. The deadline for applications was Friday morning and trading in the shares is to begin Monday. British Steel shares are priced at 125 pence, or $ 2.31 each, valuing the entire company at 2.5 billion pounds, or the equivalent of $ 4.6 billion. Private investors apparently were undeterred by the recent drop in prices on the <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> stock market, which has been unsettled by another rise in British interest rates and the recent strength of the pound. The investors seem to have looked instead at British Steel's operating strengths and the high yield on the shares, <PERSON> Oakes </PERSON> said. Investors also apparently were not frightened off by the failure of the government's last privatization, the sale of its one-third stake in <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. PLC last fall, which flopped with investors because it coincided with the stock markets' crash Privatization is the process by which a state-owned company is turned over to public ownership. The shares offered to private investors represent around 23 percent of the total 2 billion <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> shares which the British government is selling. The balance has been underwritten by British and overseas institutions. If private investors apply for more than 762 million shares, the bank will trigger a `` clawback'' mechanism, reducing the number of shares offered to overseas institutions from 33 percent to 25 percent of the total. And if applications exceed 980 million shares, British institutions will see their part in the issue reduced from 44 percent to 33 percent.

 <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s prospective new owner says there are no plans to radically dissect the food-and-cigarette giant to help pay a debt load that will quadruple to more than $ 20 billion, but securities analysts disagree. `` I'd be totally amazed if there was n't some stuff sold off,'' <PERSON> Neal </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaplan </PERSON>, who follows <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interstate-Johnson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION> said Thursday in assessing the aftermath of the biggest takeover deal in history. `` I ca n't conceive of them keeping it intact.'' After an exhaustive auction overseen by a special <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> directors committee, buyout specialist <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roberts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> triumphed late Wednesday over an <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> management group led by chief executive <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>. The directors accepted <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION>'s package of cash and securities valued at $ 109 a share for each of <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION>'s 225 million shares for a total of $ 24.53 billion, and rejected an offer from <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s group valued at $ 112 a share or $ 25.2 billion. They said both offers were nearly the same but <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION>'s offer would give shareholders a 25 percent stake in the acquired company, compared with a 15 percent stake offered by <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>. Both offers would rely heavily on borrowed money to be repaid through <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION>'s earnings, assets or both, a transaction commonly called a leveraged buyout. It was widely expected that <LOCATION> Kohlberg </LOCATION> would sell many if not all of <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION>'s food businesses and leave its highly profitable tobacco business intact. But <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> principal <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Kravis </PERSON> told a few selected financial journalists in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> he foresaw no urgent reason to sell any of <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION>'s operations, people familiar with his remarks said. `` There will be no wholesale dismemberment of the company, no immediate fire sale, and that is still the case,'' although `` obviously some businesses will have to be sold,'' the sources paraphrased <PERSON> Kravis </PERSON> as saying. No decisions have been made yet on what to shed, <PERSON> Kravis </PERSON> was quoted as saying. He also was said to have described the leveraged buyout as one of the most conservative his firm had ever done despite the enormous price. Disclosing more details of how the takeover will be financed, <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> said in a filing with the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> today that four banks will lend $ 2.7 billion and assemble a syndicate of other banks to lend another $ 14 billion. In addition, the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> filing showed, <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION>'s two main Wall Street financial backers, <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, will lend $ 5 billion to be financed by high-yield `` junk bonds,'' and <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION>'s own pool of investors will provide the rest of the money. <LOCATION> Kohlberg </LOCATION> is the undisputed leader in leveraged buyouts, which often leave acquired companies with staggering debt levels. For example, <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION>'s 1986 leveraged buyout of supermarket giant <ORGANIZATION> Safeway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> for $ 4.2 billion left the acquired company with a debt-to-equity ratio of 10-to-1. The RJR acquisition will more than quadruple the company's existing debt of $ 5 billion to $ 22.3 billion But the amount of equity in the acquired company is estimated at about $ 7.4 billion, for a debt-to-equity ratio of 3-to-1. In leveraged buyouts, that is considered low. Although <PERSON> Kravis </PERSON> said he considered the fight for <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> over, <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> and his chief financial backer, <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, hinted Thursday that they were not finished. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said in a statement he had spoken with <PERSON> Kravis </PERSON> and assured him `` that if the board's action results in <LOCATION> Kohlberg </LOCATION> <PERSON> Kravis </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> owning the company, I will work with him toward a professional and smooth transition.'' But the statement also said <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> and his investment-banking allies `` are evaluating their options.'' Some analysts speculated that <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, considered a daring corporate boss, might take the unprecedented step of sidestepping the board of the company he still heads and making an offer directly to stockholders. <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION>'s stock price rose about 66 percent during the 5-week takeover saga, partly on the prospect that ever-higher offers would emerge. But the stock fell $ 1.25 Thursday to $ 91.75 in heavy trading, evidently reflecting the view that <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION>'s package of $ 81 in cash and $ 28 in securities was worth less than its face amount. The stock retreated another 75 cents this morning to $ 91. The <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> takeover battle focused nationwide attention on the growing leveraged buyout trend and the enormous debt burdens many companies are acquiring in such transactions. Some economists fear these heavily indebted companies could face unprecedented pressure in a downturn. Underscoring that concern, <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> lowered the credit rating on <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION>'s corporate bonds Thursday, saying it was worried about the ability of the company to generate enough money to service its increased debt. At the same time, <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a large <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> bondholder that sued the company last month when the value of its bonds sank amid the takeover fight, said <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION>'s name might be added as a defendant.

<HEAD>Civilian Unemployment Edged Up in November to 5.4 Percent</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The nation's civilian unemployment rate in November edged upward from a 14-year low to 5.4 percent despite an increase of 463,000 new jobs and a record percentage of the American population at work, the government said today. The 0.1 percentage point increase from October's jobless rate of 5.3 percent was due almost entirely to a 560,000 increase in the civilian labor force _ the number of people either holding jobs or looking for them, the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said. The labor force had remained essentially unchanged from August through October and has grown by only 2 million people in the past 12 months, including the big gain in November, reflecting a tapering off of the Baby Boom generation entering the job market. Despite the slight increase in the unemployment rate, the government figures showed 116 million Americans holding jobs last month, or 62.6 percent of the adult population age 16 or over. Both are record highs, said Labor Statistics Commissioner <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Norwood </PERSON>. At the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> attributed the rise to `` a large increase in the labor force'' and noted that the total number of employed reached an all-time high. `` There were more people looking for work,'' he said. The number of factory jobs climbed by 71,000 in November on top of a four-year record-high 99,000 new assembly line workers in October following a slight decline in the late summer. `` Over the past year, the number of factory jobs has risen by 425,000,'' <PERSON> Norwood </PERSON> said in prepared testimony before the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. ` This growth has been concentrated in a limited number of industries, with machinery alone counting for more than a quarter of the gain.'' Meanwhile, factory workers continued to average four hours of overtime a week last month, indicating that the manufacturing sector is continuning to boom and there is no slowdown in the rate of economic growth. Many economists are concerned that inflation will continue increasing unless the growth rate is slowed, but there was no indication that it did in November, acording to the job figures, the first economic indicator of the month. Construction employment increased by 55,000 over the month, reflecting an upturn in housing starts, after sluggish activity from July through October. The November job figures officially mark the sixth birthday of the current economic expansion, the longest in the nation's history. But the pattern of growth has not been consistent throughout. Factory jobs, for example, rose by 1.4 million in the first two years of recovery following a loss of nearly 2 million jobs in the 1981-82 recession. But in 1985 and 1986, they declined by 600,000 before rebounding by 850,000 over the past two years. ` Not unexpectedly, changes in the unemployment rate for adult men have tracked closely with the factory job swings,'' said <PERSON> Norwood </PERSON>. ` It fell from 10 percent to 6.2 percent during the initial rebound, was unchanged in the middle years, and dropped from 6.2 percent to 4.8 percent in the past two years.'' The pattern of female joblessness, meanwhile, has shown a more consistent, gradual decline. It, too, was 4.8 percent last month. The service side of the economy added 345,000 new jobs last month, including 40,000 in transportation, reflecting an improvement in the health of the airline industry. Retail trade employment climbed by 19,000 despite a decrease of 2,000 workers in department stores. Department store employment has now been falling for five months in a row, an indication to some economists that consumer spending is slowing and that exports of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> manufactred products abroad are propelling the nation's continued growth Health service jobs rose by 56,000 last month while employment in business services such as data processing climbed by 31,000 after several months of sluggish activity. Meanwhile, average hourly earnings were unchanged at $ 9.45 in November after rising by a nickel in October, setting off fears of a wage-push inflation then. An alternate employment rate that includes the 1.7 million members of the Armed Forces stationed in the country also rose last month, from 5.2 percent to 5.3 percent. Unemployment rates for various population groups showed little or no improvement. They climbed from 11 percent to 11.2 percent for blacks, from 7.7 percent to 8.1 percent for Hispanics and from 26.5 percent to 30.4 percent for black teen-agers.

 In their latest and most likely final offer, the management of <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> offered shareholders $ 8 billion more for their shares than in their first offer. What is $ 8 billion? Among other things, it is the asset value of a company the size of <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mining </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, including about 180 plants and 370 sales offices and distribution centers in 49 countries. Or it is the assets of <ORGANIZATION> Georgia-Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which owns or has cutting rights to 5.6 million acres of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> timberlands _ plus <ORGANIZATION> Morton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the aerospace contractor, and a few hundred million dollars in change. Had shareholders accepted the first offer, which was publicized as being in their interest, they would have, so to speak, left that much on the table. It is because of such mind-boggling considerations as these that aspects of the <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> sale will be debated well into the next century, and perhaps as long as business schools exist. Did shareholders get a fair deal? It would seem so, since the stock leaped in a few weeks from $ 55 a share to more than $ 90. But even after such good fortune, some shareholders might not be as happy as you might think. A good many <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> shareholders were long-term investors with an eye on the steady dividends of 5 percent or so a year, which they had expected to continue well into the future. These investors were not traders or sellers. <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> was, to them, a source of income. Suddenly, they have capital gains taxes to pay which, when combined with state taxes, could approach 40 percent. What does the precipitous sale of an established company mean to holders of bonds? Big losses. <PERSON> Bonds </PERSON> purchased when the company's debt position was strong have, inevitably, lost value as the company becomes burdened with debt The questions drive at the very meaning of a company. Is a corporation a dynamic, ever-changing institution whose value _ to its immediate owners or to society at large _ lies in its unique ability to produce products and services? Or is it to be viewed as a static entity, like a consumer product on a shelf, to be sold, and in the selling lose all its future value as a creator of change, a payer of dividends, an employer, a taxpayer, a producer? How is the <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> management to be viewed, or in fact the management of any company that promises to serve the shareholders, creditors, employees and customers, but which plots to take the company for its own portfolio? The meaning of `` insider trading,'' a term used commonly to describe those outsiders who gain access to inside information and use it for their own financial gain, might have to be reconsidered. Consider that prior to making their announcements, buyout managements use privileged information to construct their offer. They allow investors to buy bonds, knowing that those bonds will fall in value on their announcement. Is it proper for management to arrange for the continuance of their salaries, plus benefits, bonuses and lucrative pensions should they fail in their takeover attempt and instead fall prey to a hostile offer? Is an insider takeover and dismantling a proper end for a thriving company built on the savings, sacrifices and ingenuity of entrepreneurs, the millions of man-hours of labor, the years of risks, the hard times conquered? In comparison, what sacrifices, ingenuity, labor, risks and hard times are incurred by a management that benefits from its failure, i.e. that puts the company on the block because it thinks it might be better dead than alive? The debate is only beginning.

 The recent ruling ordering a Japanese computer company to pay <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> for use of the software information running its computers was fair and should satisfy concerns over protecting intellectual property rights, <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> arbitrators said Friday. In a landmark case, two arbitrators assigned by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arbitration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> Tuesday ordered <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s largest computer firm, <ORGANIZATION> Fujitsu </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, to pay <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> $ 237 million and tens of millions of dollars each year beginning in 1989 under a complex payout plan for special access to <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>'s mainframe computer software. Including past payments, <ORGANIZATION> Fujitsu </ORGANIZATION> could pay <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> more than $ 1 billion by the end of the century. The decision followed years of wrangling between the world's biggest computer company and its main Japanese rival over what <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> claimed was <ORGANIZATION> Fujitsu </ORGANIZATION>'s infringement on its intellectual property rights <ORGANIZATION> Fujitsu </ORGANIZATION> competes with <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> in the mainframe computer business with a line of machines and accompanying base-layer software that are supposed to be able to run the same programs as the <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> mainframes. Exploiting often murky copyright laws, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> has been accused in the past of altering imported technology to suit its own requirements. The ruling by the arbitration association is expected to make Japanese industry more cautious. `` The days when ideas were free are now over,'' said an editorial Thursday in the Asahi Evening News. `` By tradition, Japanese industry has relied on Western technologies for growth, freely ` borrowing' them and adapting them cleverly to its own needs.'' `` But this wo n't be acceptable in the future,'' the editorial said. `` The <ORGANIZATION> AAA </ORGANIZATION> ruling on the IBM-Fujitsu dispute will lend impetus to the mounting global trend toward demanding monetary payment for intellectual property.'' <PERSON> Mnookin </PERSON>, a law professor at <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> had invested billions of dollars in its operating systems software. While `` the precise scope of copyright protection is not entirely clear, what is clear is that this investment in its property is worthy of ... protection,'' he said. He said the ruling was `` fair and balanced'' and one in which both parties were made substantially better off. `` Any concerns that customers may have had because of uncertainties about intellectual property rights with respect to compatible operating system software have now been put to rest,'' <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 About 2,200 of the most senior <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> workers in <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION> will continue to receive full pay and benefits after the Dec. 23 end of production in the city until a company-funded, $ 20 million job bank is depleted, a union official says. <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Local </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> 72 </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shop </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Rudy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuzel </PERSON> said Thursday the job bank was provided in the plant closing agreement negotiated with <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Kuzel </PERSON> estimated it will take the 2,200 employees about eight to nine weeks, or until about March, to deplete the $ 20 million. After the money is gone, the workers can turn to state-sponsored unemployment compensation benefits and company-funded Supplemental Unemployment Benefits. The job bank was formed as compensation for the transfer of L-body <ORGANIZATION> Dodge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Omni </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Plymouth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Horizon </ORGANIZATION> model production from <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION> to <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s Jefferson Avenue plant in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>. `` But the job bank is not just for those working on L-body,'' <PERSON> Kuzel </PERSON> said. The contract said the 2,200 most senior employees could be transferred to non-traditional work once the L-body line is moved. But <PERSON> Kuzel </PERSON> said he doubts enough work will remain in <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION> for all of them to actually be on the job. Regardless of whether they are working or not, they will earn full pay and benefits, he said. The <ORGANIZATION> Wisconsin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Job </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> has said that most <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> employees losing their jobs as a result of the plant closing will be eligible for $ 200 weekly unemployment benefits for 26 weeks. The union workers are to also receive SUB benefits of $ 100 per week for 24 weeks. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> has said the ending of auto production in <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION> will put about 5,300 people out of work. About 1,200 people are to continue working at the automaker's engine operation in <LOCATION> Kenosha </LOCATION>.

He said the truck represented a five-year commitment by <PERSON> Mack </PERSON>, $ 60 million in design and development, plus millions of miles in testing. `` We see the results of shortcutting this process far too often in today's super-competitive truck industry,'' <PERSON> Curcio </PERSON> said. `` We resisted the temptation to rush to the market with a rehashed version of the same old thing, or to rush a less-than-fully developed and tested vehicle to market, as some other manufacturers have done.'' The innovations are expected to increase <PERSON> Mack </PERSON>'s market share by 2 to 3 percentage points by 1991 from its current share of about 15 percent, said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Ritter </PERSON>, senior vice president of sales for the company. After operating in red ink from 1982 through 1986, <ORGANIZATION> Mack </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trucks </ORGANIZATION> earned $ 4.09 million in 1987. The company has said it expects to move further into the black this year. Through the first nine months of 1988, <PERSON> Mack </PERSON> reported earnings of $ 18 million on sales of $ 1.6 billion, compared to a $ 15 million profit on sales of $ 1.4 billion during the same period in 1987. The truck includes a new frame and chassis, and aerodynamic efficiency was a key consideration in its design, <PERSON> Curcio </PERSON> said. Among aspects designed to smooth air flow around the truck are a two-piece windshield sloped 20 degrees and rounded and contoured lamps, the company said. The CH600 will be no more expensive than <PERSON> Mack </PERSON>'s former conventional `` R'' truck _ averaging about $ 60,000. The CH600 _ and the E-7 engine to be introduced for the truck in July or August _ are part of <PERSON> Mack </PERSON>'s $ 500 million capital expenditure program begun by <PERSON> Curcio </PERSON> in 1983. Part of <PERSON> Curcio </PERSON>'s program was the replacement of the company's antiquated 5C assembly plant in <LOCATION> Allentown </LOCATION> with one of the industry's most modern assembly Production of the new truck is to begin Jan. 1. Last year, <PERSON> Mack </PERSON> introduced its CM400, its down-sized `` Baby 8'' intercity vehicle, and began producing it in its <LOCATION> Macungie </LOCATION> assembly plant. The company also is spending $ 100 million to modernize its power-train division in <LOCATION> Hagerstown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, for production of the new E-7 engine.

 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar turned mixed against the major <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> currencies on Friday. Gold prices also varied. The news that non-farm payrolls in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> rose by 463,000 in November, exceeding expectations by some 200,000, helped the dollar early in the day. But <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> dealers said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency could n't hold most of the rise because of sales of dollars in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, a large, unidentified order to buy sterling, and some profit-taking. News that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> unemployment rate in October was revised upward to 5.4 percent from 5.3 percent also hurt the dollar. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, one British pound cost $ 1.8597 late Friday, more expensive for buyers than Thursday's late $ 1.8535. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> compared with Thursday's late rates: 1.7315 West German marks, up from 1.7300; 1.4598 Swiss francs, up from 1.4498; 5.9200 French francs, up from 5.9075; 1.9490 Dutch guilders, down from 1.9510; 1,279.50 Italian lire, up from 1,278.00; and 1.1869 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1855.

<HEAD>KKR Discloses Details of RJR Financing</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VIVIAN MARINO</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roberts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> unveiled on Friday the financing plan for its record $ 24.53 billion purchase of <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> that includes a complex assortment of bank loans, junk bonds and some cash from its own pocket. In a filing with the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, the powerful Wall Street buyout firm illustrated the techniques it typically uses in leveraged buyouts, only on a far grander scale. The LBO concept is quite simple: After making a small downpayment, a firm and its investors borrow the rest of the purchase and pay off that debt with funds generated by a target company's profits or asset sales. In effect, the business itself is used as collateral. The borrowing process, though, can get confusing. `` A lot of the financing is just plain vanilla. That's not the case here,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Waill </PERSON>, a high-yield bond specialist with <ORGANIZATION> L.F. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rothschild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The RJR buyout will require more than $ 20 billion in loans to finance the cash portion of the $ 109-a-share offer accepted Wednesday by a special <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> directors committee. <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION>'s offer was selected over a $ 25.2 billion bid from a group led by <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION>'s chief executive. Besides getting $ 81 in cash for each of their shares, <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> stockholders will receive a total $ 4 billion in preferred stock and $ 2.3 bilion in convertible bonds. <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> said in its <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> filing that four banks _ <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Chase </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Citibank </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hanover </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> _ will lend $ 2.7 billion themselves and assemble a syndicate of other banks to lend an additional $ 14 billion. <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION>'s two main Wall Street financial backers, <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, will provide $ 5 billion in short-term `` bridge loans'' that will be repaid by selling high-yield, high-risk `` junk bonds,'' according to the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> filing and a spokeswoman for <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION>. Another $ 5 billion of existing <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> debt also could become downgraded to junk bonds in the processs since the acquistion will more than quadruple the company's existing debt to $ 22.3 billion. The buyout also will make RJR the largest single junk bond issuer, analysts said. <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> now holds that distinction, with $ 4.2 billion. `` One major difference is that <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION> did n't issue them all at once,'' said <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Urbaszewski </PERSON>, who manages $ 4 billion in junk bonds at <ORGANIZATION> Kemper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. But <PERSON> Urbaszewski </PERSON> believes the high-yield market can absorb the deluge of expected <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> debt, as long as those issues are priced right. `` There's plenty of cash out there now,'' he said. <PERSON> Urbaszewski </PERSON> noted that despite the huge resulting debt load, <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION>'s ratio of debt to equity would be only 3-to-1, which is considered low for a leveraged buyout. By contrast, <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION>'s 1986 buyout of supermarket giant <ORGANIZATION> Safeway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> for $ 4.2 billion left the acquired company with a debt-to-equity ratio of 10-to-1. The higher the debt load the harder it is for a company to pay off its loans. For its part, <LOCATION> Kohlberg </LOCATION> is putting up $ 1.5 billion in cash for the <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> acquisition, most of which will come from a $ 5 billion pool of capital invested by institutional investors. <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> also is lending $ 500 million for the acquisition, the filing said. A <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman said she did not know exactly how much of the $ 1.5 billion in cash was coming from the buyout firm itself. However, the <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported Friday that <PERSON> Kohlberg </PERSON> planned to put only slightly more than $ 15 million of its own money into the purchase.

 <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> members that do business with the public saw their after-tax profits drop sharply in the third quarter, the exchange reported Friday. In the July-September period, net earnings for the 378 corporations and partnerships that trade on the exchange fell to $ 193 million, the report said. That was down 47.1 percent from $ 365 million in the second quarter and off 61.4 percent from $ 500 million in the third quarter last year. Revenue in the latest quarter totaled $ 13.193 billion, the third highest level in the history of the exchange. That was up 6 percent from $ 12.449 billion in the second quarter but down 2 percent from $ 13.412 billion in the same quarter of 1987. The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> said about 55 percent of the 378 firms reporting for the quarter were profitable. The 207 profitable firms reported aggregate pre-tax earnings of $ 698 million, while the 171 unprofitable firms reported an aggregate loss of $ 406 million, the exchange said. After-tax profit for the latest quarter represented a 2.1 percent annual return on the member firms' average net worth of $ 36.75 billion during the period. After-tax earnings are presented on a pro-forma basis assuming a regular corporate tax rate or credit of 34 percent. The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> figures include revenue from all sources, including trading and interest income, as well as commission revenue.

 <ORGANIZATION> Unocal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> signed a joint venture agreement Friday with <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>'s state oil company under which <ORGANIZATION> Unocal </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> refinery and other assets will be transferred to the new enterprise Under the `` heads of agreement,'' similar to a letter of intent, <ORGANIZATION> Unocal </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Petroleos </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Venezuela </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> S.A. </ORGANIZATION> will each hold a 50 percent share in the new venture. Officials said the new pact is contingent on the partners negotiating acceptable crude oil supply agreements. But <ORGANIZATION> Unocal </ORGANIZATION> said it expects to realize in excess of $ 500 million if the joint venture is completed. `` The formation of this joint venture would provide <ORGANIZATION> Unocal </ORGANIZATION> with more reliable margins and significant cash which we will apply to debt repayment or other uses,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stegemeier </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Unocal </ORGANIZATION> president and chief executive. `` At the same time, the venture would provide <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> with a refined products market for its crude oil.'' As reported on Thursday, the joint venture will involve refining and distributing petroleum in 12 midwestern states. The deal provides for a daily crude oil supply of 135,000 barrels. The assets to be transferred to the partnership include <ORGANIZATION> Unocal </ORGANIZATION>'s 147,000-barrel-per-day refinery in <LOCATION> Lemont </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, shares in pipelines from the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Lemont </LOCATION> and 14 distribution terminals as well as 149 <ORGANIZATION> Unocal </ORGANIZATION> service stations and a network of 190 marketers The value of the assets involved in the deal was not disclosed, but estimates are that they are worth approximately $ 700 million. <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>, a member of <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>, has recently purchased other refineries in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, including a 50 percent interest in <ORGANIZATION> Citgo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and all of <ORGANIZATION> Champlin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Refining </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Precious Metals Surge On Jobless Data, Argentina</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Prices of precious metals futures surged Friday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> amid renewed inflation fears and jitters over a military insurrection in <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, analysts said. On other markets, copper and cattle futures fell sharply; pork futures were mixed; grains and soybeans were higher; energy futures were mixed; and stock-index futures advanced. Analysts counted Friday's unemployment report as one bullish factor in the precious-metals markets. The 5.4 percent November jobless rate was near expectations but the increase of 463,000 new jobs was much higher than the markets had anticipated, and many saw it as a sign that wages and inflation may rise. `` If you're looking at precious metals as an inflation hedge, the unemployment numbers were quite positive,'' said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Barbanel </PERSON>, director of futures trading with <ORGANIZATION> Gruntal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> brokerage firm. Analysts also agreed that the dollar's weakness, following a strong start, helped fuel the precious-metals rally. News reports of a mutinous clash between loyal and rebel military factions near <LOCATION> Buenos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aires </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, may also have sparked some buying among those who favor gold as a haven during turbulent times, said <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Hinton </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Elders </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The rally accelerated when gold futures cracked a key technical resistance point at around $ 432 on the contract for February delivery. `` That really set the market off,'' <PERSON> Hinton </PERSON> said. `` You're getting into an area where a lot of people are saying, ` This downtrend is over, it's time to get out of long-term short -LRB- or sell -RRB- positions.''' Gold settled $ 7.80 to $ 9.90 higher with the active February contract at $ 436.70 an ounce and spot December at $ 431.70; silver was 9 cents to 10.2 cents higher with active March at $ 6.335 a troy ounce and spot December at $ 6.19. Platinum was $ 7.50 to $ 15 higher with January at $ 615.90 a troy ounce. Copper futures sold off sharply in afternoon trading on the <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> on profit-taking ahead of the weekend and uncertainty over the labor situation in <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION>, where mineworkers have been on strike for more than six weeks, analysts said. Copper settled .30 cent to 3.8 cents lower with December at $ 1.502 a pound. Cattle futures prices plummeted on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> on mostly technical selling triggered when the price for December delivery of live cattle slipped below 72 cents a pound. `` The market's kicking its foot in the dirt because it's kind of disappointed it has n't gone above 75 cents yet,'' said <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Gidel </PERSON>, an analyst in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> with the G.H. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> division of <ORGANIZATION> LIT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. Live cattle settled .52 cent to 1.42 cents lower with December at 71.50 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .45 cent to .83 cent lower with January at 82.32 cents a pound; live hogs were .48 cent lower to .35 cent higher with December at 40.35 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .30 cent to .43 cent higher with February at 45.37 cents a pound Soybean futures prices settled sharply higher on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> on reduced chances for a wet weekend in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> soybean belt and strong gains in the soybean oil market. Grain futures finished mostly higher. Concerns about the unusually dry weather in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, the world's second - and fourth-largest soybean producers, have become the dominant factor in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soybean futures market since planting began in those countries earlier this fall Forecasts for a rainy weekend in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> had prompted active selling of futures on Thursday but Friday's forecasts indicated chances for rain were diminishing, and that sparked a rally, analysts said. Wheat settled 1 cent lower to 3 cents higher with December at $ 4.19 a bushel; corn was 1 \ cents lower to 1 -LCB- cents higher with December at $ 2.58 -RCB- a bushel; oats were 3 cents to 5 -LCB- cents higher with December at $ 1.94 \ a bushel; soybeans were 8 cents to 10 -RCB- cents higher with January at $ 7.68 -RCB- a Crude oil prices rose while gasoline and heating oil futures finished mostly lower in light trading on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. West Texas Intermediate crude settled 3 cents to 4 cents higher with January at $ 15.64 a barrel; heating oil was .22 cent lower to .08 cent higher with January at 48.96 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .20 cent to .45 cent lower with January at 45.57 cents a gallon. Stock-index futures retreated slightly on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, where the contract for December delivery of the <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's 500 settled .70 point lower at 272.50.

 Stock prices fell Friday but still displayed signs of resilience after the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> issued an employment report that deepened investor concerns about inflation. `` The market absorbed the negative news fairly well _ I did n't see a selling rout by any means,'' said <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Acampora </PERSON>, a market analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Kidder </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peabody </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials fell 9.60 to 2,092.28 after having been down about 17 points in early trading. The index closed out the week with a 17.60-point gain. Declining issues outnumbered advancers by about 4-to-3 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed stocks, with 822 issues down, 616 up and 504 unchanged. Volume on the floor of the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> came to a sluggish 124.61 million shares, down from 129.38 million in the previous session. Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trading at regional exchanges and on the over-the-counter market, totaled 150.79 million shares. The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s monthly report on employment had been eagerly awaited by financial markets for indications on the direction of the economy. But the news that 463,000 new jobs were created last month came as a blow to traders because it meant the economy remained strong. The markets believed the higher-than-expected gain in jobs would prompt the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> to raise its discount rate to keep a lid on inflation. Bond prices slumped on the news, with the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>'s 30-year issue skidding about $ 15 per $ 1,000 in face amount by late afternoon. Meanwhile, the bond's yield surged to about 9.16 percent from late Thursday's 9.02 percent, and short-term interest rates also moved higher. Wall Street took its cue from the credit markets, opening lower and continuting to slide. But as the afternoon wore on, blue chip issues recovered some lost ground. `` Most market participants were suprised that the market was not hit harder,'' said <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldman </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> A.G. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Edwards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sons </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Acampora </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Kidder </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peabody </ORGANIZATION> analyst, said, `` A lot of the negative news was already discounted in the market.'' <PERSON> Goldman </PERSON> said Wall Street faces a critical test in coming sessions because of competition from the increasingly attractive yields of short-term debt and money-market instruments. `` One-year T -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- bills offer extremely stiff competition for the stock market,'' <PERSON> Goldman </PERSON> said. Yields on one-year bills reached 8.94 percent by late Friday. If the Dow Jones industrial average falls through the 2,030 mark and other market indicators drop below important psychological levels, `` Christmas and the first of the new year will bring little cheer, and there will be trouble well into the first quarter'' for Wall Street, <PERSON> Goldman </PERSON> said. However, if stocks `` hold at these levels, it will signal that there are enough buyers around who feel that stocks are attractive,'' he said. The most-actively traded issue on the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> was <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION>, which fell 1 to 90 -RCB-. Technology issues were among the gainers. <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> rose 1 to 119 \, <ORGANIZATION> Digital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Equipment </ORGANIZATION> was up 1 -RRB- to 95 \ and <ORGANIZATION> Compaq </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> picked up 1 -LRB- to close at 57 Among the decliners were <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T, down | to 28 -RCB-, <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION>, which dropped 1 \ to 84 -LRB-, and <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION>, off ~ to 83 As measured by <ORGANIZATION> Wilshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>' index of more than 5,000 actively traded stocks, the market fell $ 3.696 billion, or 0.14 percent, in value. The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> composite index of all its listed common stocks fell 0.35 to 153.02. <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's industrial index slipped 0.62 to 313.16, and <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; P's 500-stock composite index fell 0.68 to 271.81. The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market rose 0.04 to 373.91.

<TEXT>
 The government's report of stronger-than-expected job growth in November stunned the bond market Friday, sending prices sharply lower and interest rates higher on speculation that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> may tighten credit conditions to slow economic growth. Bond traders who were anticipating a rise of about half of the 463,000 new jobs reported were `` shocked by the numbers'' and sold bonds on the report, said <PERSON> Maury </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, economist for the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> PaineWebber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The selloff was described as orderly, however, and the market soon stabilized at the lower levels. Some analysts said the job growth figure indicated the economy is expanding so quickly that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> will move to tighten credit, and possibly boost the rate it charges on loans to financial institutions, to slow the economy down and avoid a resurgence of inflation. <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON> <PERSON> Platt </PERSON>, fixed-income research director for <ORGANIZATION> Donaldson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lufkin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Jenrette </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>, said chances of a half-point increase in the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s discount rate to 7 percent next week `` are fairly high.'' But <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> and some other analysts said they did not expect the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> to raise the discount rate so quickly, and pointed to other parts of the same jobs report as evidence that the economy is not overheating. The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>'s closely watched 30-year bond dropped 1 -RRB- points, or $ 13.75 for every $ 1,000 in face amount. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from its price, climbed to 9.16 percent from 9.02 percent late Thursday. The <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Bond Index, which measures price movements on all outstanding <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> issues with maturities of a year or longer, dropped 9.26 to 1,129.20, its biggest one-day drop since it fell 9.48 on Nov. 4 after the October employment report also showed unexpected strength. Short-term interest rates rocketed higher. Yields on one-year <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bills, for instance, jumped to 8.94 percent from 8.63 percent late Thursday. The activity was triggered early Friday when the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported 463,000 jobs were created in November. Many analysts had expected an increase of about 250,000. But some economists said the market appeared to overlook other evidence contained in the report that suggested another view of the economy. `` It really is n't as strong as it seems,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Brusca </PERSON>, chief economist for <ORGANIZATION> Nikko </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> B. Front, vice president at the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Stein </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farnham </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, said the report showed the economy may be moderating. He said the unemployment rate, for instance, rose a tenth of a percentage point to 5.4 percent in November, the average work week edged down 12 minutes and average hourly wages were unchanged. In addition, Front noted, the report revised estimated job growth in October to 238,000 from the 323,000 initially reported. `` I'll bet they wo n't raise the discount rate. There are enough signs of easing in the economy to forestall such an increase,'' he said. In the secondary market for <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bonds, prices of short-term governments fell by -LCB- point to | point, intermediate maturities lost ~ point and 20-year issues fell nearly a full point, according to <ORGANIZATION> Telerate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a financial information service. The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $ 10 in the price of a bond with a $ 1,000 face value. In corporate trading, industrials were lower. <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION>'s Investment Grade Corporate Bond Index, which measures price movements on 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years or longer, fell 1.70 to 293.43. In the tax-exempt market, prices fell more than -LCB- point, according to the Bond Buyers index of 40 actively-traded municipal issues. Yields on three-month <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bills rose to 8.31 percent as the discount climbed 20 basis points to 8.04 percent. Yields on six-month bills rose to 8.72 percent as the discount jumped 25 basis points to 8.25 percent. With yields on one-year bills rising to 8.94 percent, the discount on those issues rose 27 basis points to 8.28 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield is the annualized return on an investment in a <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bill. The discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face value, which is paid at maturity. The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was quoted at 8 9-16 percent, up from 8 -LCB- percent late Thursday.

<HEAD>Farley Calls for Special Meeting of Pepperell Shareholders</HEAD>

 <ORGANIZATION> Farley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said Friday it would ask shareholders of textile giant <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Point-Pepperell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> to hold a special meeting to consider <PERSON> Farley </PERSON>'s $ 1.4 billion tender offer to acquire <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION>. Spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Kronfeld </PERSON> of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Point </LOCATION>, Ga.-based <ORGANIZATION> Pepperell </ORGANIZATION> said the company would have no comment on <PERSON> Farley </PERSON>'s request. <PERSON> Farley </PERSON>, Chicago-based owner of Fruit of the Loom underwear and other companies, extended its offer Thursday, saying it had garnered nearly 50 percent of <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION>'s stock. The offer, which was to expire at midnight Wednesday, was extended by one week to midnight EST Dec. 7. <PERSON> Farley </PERSON> said today that <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION> shareholders of record as of Monday are entitled to call for a special meeting. Under <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> law, the company said, <ORGANIZATION> Pepperell </ORGANIZATION> management must call such a meeting if shareholders of record of 25 percent of outstanding shares support it. `` Our intention has always been to conduct friendy negotiations on a mutually acceptable business combination, but <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION> management refuses to talk to us and has impeded shareholders from even considering our offer,'' said chairman <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Farley </PERSON> in a statement. `` We have no choice but to seek a special meeting where shareholders can decide for themselves whether our $ 48-per-share cash tender offer should succeed,'' he said. `` Shareholders have that right.'' <PERSON> Farley </PERSON> officials said Thursday a preliminary count showed that about 11.4 million shares of <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION>'s common stock had been tendered by shareholders as of the close of business Wednesday. With the shares <PERSON> Farley </PERSON> already owns, that would give the company about 49 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Pepperell </ORGANIZATION>'s stock. <PERSON> Farley </PERSON> officials have declined to say how much of the <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> company's stock they hope to acquire. An appeals court has scheduled a hearing the week of Jan. 9 to determine the fate of <LOCATION> Pepperell </LOCATION>'s `` poison pill'' shareholder rights plan, designed to thwart hostile takeovers. <PERSON> Farley </PERSON>'s offer is contingent on getting the plan overturned. <PERSON> Farley </PERSON> also has gone to court to challenge the constitutionality of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>'s anti-takeover law, but no hearing date has been set on that issue.

 <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the object of a $ 5.23 billion hostile takeover bid, announced Friday it has agreed to sell its Grain Merchandising Division, a chain of restaurants and a food division. <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Haeg </PERSON> denied that the sales, terms of which were not disclosed, were made in reaction to the takeover attempt. `` It is consistent with the restructuring effort that was underway for quite some time to focus in on our core businesses,'' said <PERSON> Haeg </PERSON>, who added that plans to sell the Grain Merchandising Division were announced July 25. <ORGANIZATION> Grand </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>'s takeover efforts first came to light in early October, he noted. Grand Met, a British liquor and gambling conglomerate, launched its $ 60-a-share, all-cash tender offer for <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> on Oct. 4. Grand Met's fifth offer was set to expire at midnight EST Friday unless extended again. <PERSON> Haeg </PERSON> declined to comment on <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION>'s plans Friday. `` As a matter of policy, we have never responded to those offers,'' he said. Grand Met spokesman <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON> refused to comment on what Grand Met planned to do once the offer expired. He also would n't say if Grand Met had heard from <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> sold its Grain Merchandising Division to <ORGANIZATION> ConAgra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a diversified food company based in <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Neb. </LOCATION>, with annual sales of $ 9.5 billion. The <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> division consists of 50 grain facilities primarily in the <LOCATION> Upper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> and about 200 river barges that are owned or leased by <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Haeg </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> ConAgra </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Phares </PERSON> said the company `` fully expects to hire a large percentage of those employees.'' <PERSON> Haeg </PERSON> said about 750 people are currently employed at the Grain Merchandising Division. The sale should be completed by the end of January, said <PERSON> Phares </PERSON>, vice president of public relations at <ORGANIZATION> ConAgra </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Haeg </PERSON> said it was not known how much the division was worth, but said it was part of the company's industrial foods division, which had sales of $ 416 million last year. The Minneapolis-based food and restaurant giant also said it was selling Bay Street, a chain of 12 seafood restaurants based in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>. The chain was sold to <ORGANIZATION> Bay </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Restaurant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a management group led by <ORGANIZATION> Bay </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> Manager <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Palmieri </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Bouffard </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Restaurant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, an investment group, <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement.

 <ORGANIZATION> RKO </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> on Friday completed the $ 320 million sale of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> television station <ORGANIZATION> KHJ </ORGANIZATION> to <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Walt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, marking a milestone toward ending a 23-year dispute between RKO and federal regulators. Of the purchase price, $ 103 million, or 32 percent, goes to a broadcast company that challenged the fitness of RKO and its parent, <ORGANIZATION> GenCorp </ORGANIZATION>, to hold a broadcaster's license. <ORGANIZATION> GenCorp </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Fairlawn </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, gets $ 217 million, the companies said. The payment to the challenger, <ORGANIZATION> Fidelity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, was ordered by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> as part of a settlement of license challenges based on allegations of improper billings and other <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> rule violations by RKO. The commission stripped RKO of one television license in 1980, and, in effect, is forcing the company to sell <ORGANIZATION> KHJ </ORGANIZATION> and its 13 other radio and TV stations on unfavorable terms. Sale of <ORGANIZATION> KHJ </ORGANIZATION>, the biggest of RKO's stations and the starting point of the dispute, is intended to serve as a model for disposal of the rest of the stations. `` This signals a watershed event for us,'' said <ORGANIZATION> GenCorp </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Rip </PERSON> <PERSON> Tilden </PERSON>. `` We're out of operation of KHJ-TV ... We're getting out of the broadcast business.'' The sale was completed a day after <ORGANIZATION> KHJ </ORGANIZATION>'s broadcast license came up for renewal and was awarded to Los Angeles-based <ORGANIZATION> Fidelity </ORGANIZATION>. The sale agreement calls for <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> to run the station and for <ORGANIZATION> Fidelity </ORGANIZATION> to eventually transfer the license to <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION>. The sale was set up by a settlement among RKO, various competitors and the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> that was approved by the commission in July. The arrangement, which FCC records indicate was intended to both punish RKO and bring the dispute to a speedy end, calls for sale of the company's remaining properties _ a TV station and nine radio stations _ on similar terms. RKO's trouble with the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> began in 1965, when <ORGANIZATION> Fidelity </ORGANIZATION> challenged its fitness to hold a license for KHJ. In that complaint and in other challenges ultimately filed to all RKO's licenses, the company's business practices and the corporate character of its parent, then known as <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Rubber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, were called into question. In a 1980 ruling that stripped RKO of its license to run <ORGANIZATION> WNAC-TV </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, the commission found that <ORGANIZATION> GenCorp </ORGANIZATION>, RKO and the various stations had engaged in improper billing, submission of false financial statements and demonstrated lack of concern for <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> rules and federal laws. In weighing the challenges, the commission also considered evidence General Tire had engaged in `` schemes which defrauded partially owned affiliate companies of millions of dollars,'' made improper political contributions and bribed foreign officials to further its business interests, according to <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> records. <ORGANIZATION> GenCorp </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Tilden </PERSON> noted the company has n't acknowledged any violations of FCC rules. He said the decision to sell all the stations and eliminate RKO is in keeping with a <ORGANIZATION> GenCorp </ORGANIZATION> business strategy of focusing on its main industrial operations, which include making aerospace and automotive components and plastic products. `` We feel we are perfectly fit to operate a broadcast station,'' <PERSON> Tilden </PERSON> said. One of the unusual aspects of the settlement is the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION>'s allowing <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> _ which was n't a part of the license challenges _ to enter as a `` white knight'' to buy KHJ `` We've always taken a position with the commission that we thought <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> would be a nice opportunity to get someone in there to resolve what has been a messy situation for 20 years,'' said <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> vice president who arranged the deal. Sale agreements similar to the <ORGANIZATION> KHJ </ORGANIZATION> deal have been approved for <ORGANIZATION> RKO </ORGANIZATION>'s WHBQ-AM in <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>; WGMS-AM in <LOCATION> Bethesda </LOCATION>, Md.; WGMS-FM in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> WRKO-AM </ORGANIZATION> and WROR-FM in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. The company is seeking buyers for WOR-AM and <ORGANIZATION> WRKS-FM </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>; KRTH-AM and KRTH-FM in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>; KFRC-AM in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>;, WAXY-FM in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>; WFYR-FM in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>; and WHBQ-TV in <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>.

 News that record numbers of Americans are working jolted the financial markets by raising fears that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> will tighten credit to squelch rapid economic growth and pre-empt higher inflation. The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Friday that civilian unemployment in November edged upward to 5.4 percent from a 14-year low of 5.3 percent, largely because of an expansion in the civilian labor force. But the department's report also showed an increase of nearly a half-million new jobs, which means a record 116 million Americans or 62.6 percent of the adult population are gainfully employed. The number frightened bondholders because it suggested the economy is growing so rapidly that inflation will rise, forcing the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> to raise interest rates, the standard remedy for taming a growth-price spiral. Higher interest rates hurt bonds and other fixed-income investments. The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>'s key 30-year bond lost $ 13.75 per $ 1,000 in face amount and its yield, which often portends other interest rate increases, rose to 9.16 percent from 9.02 percent late Thursday. The bond market's anxiety spilled into the stock market, though not as badly. The Dow Jones industrial average fell 9.60 to 2,092.28, closing out the week with a 17.60 point gain. Ordinarily, higher interest rates rally the dollar, because they make dollar-denominated holdings worth more. But in a curious twist, the dollar fell Friday because foreign-exchange traders did n't foresee an immediate move by the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> to tighten credit The unemployment report dominated the news Friday and obscured other government statistics that presented a mixed picture. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said sales of new, single-family homes rose 3.5 percent in October to the highest level in more than 1 -LCB- years. It followed a drop of 1.4 percent in September. The department also said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> factory orders rose $ 3.5 billion, or 1.6 percent, in October to a seasonally adjusted $ 226.2 billion on the strength of big gains in orders for military ships and tanks. But the key category of non-defense capital goods, considered a good barometer of industry investment plans, fell 3.0 percent to $ 33.8 billion, following a large 10.2 percent drop in September.

 Energy futures closed the week on a high note as investors remained optimistic that <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> would stick to its latest production agreement. On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> Friday, the January contract for <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intermediate </ORGANIZATION>, the benchmark grade of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude oil, settled 3 cents higher at $ 15.64 after trading as high as $ 15.74. Other contract months also advanced slightly. Refined petroleum products traded on the exchange were mostly lower in what analysts said were technical factors. The January contract for unleaded gasoline declined 0.41 cent to settle at 45.57 cents a gallon, while other contract months also fell. January heating oil closed down 0.22 cent at 48.96 cents a gallon, while other contract months finished mixed. Analysts said the optimism begun after last Monday's decision by <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> to drastically reduce production managed to carry through the week despite skepticism that the agreement would last. `` Two weeks ago you could n't find a bull; now you ca n't find a bear,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Fiedler </PERSON>, vice president in charge of energy brokering for <ORGANIZATION> E.D. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> F. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Man </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The 13-nation <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION> agreed Monday to reduce its volume by about 4 million barrels a day to 18.5 million barrels. The cartel also agreed to maintain its old benchmark price of $ 18 a barrel. Immediately after the announcement, oil prices surged to $ 15.80 a barrel, its high for the week, leveled off on Tuesday, then climbed the rest of the week but failed to reach Monday's highs. Statements of support for the agreement from various <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> representatives during the week helped keep prices strong, analysts said. In addition, prices were supported by talk that non-OPEC producing nations were considering the possibility of reducing their output to help soak up the current world oil glut and ensure the success of the accord. Analysts and brokers remained mixed in their assessment of where prices would head in coming weeks. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Hiley </PERSON>, a broker for <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, saidthe market is unlikely to make further headway until it receives confirmation of whether <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> will stick to its agreement. Until then, he believes prices will drift in the $ 15 range of this week. `` <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> has milked the agreement for all it's worth and now the market is waiting until January to what's going to happen,'' <PERSON> Hiley </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> accord is scheduled to take effect Jan. 1.

 <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s chief executive is cooperating with the buyout firm that defeated him in a frenetic takeover struggle for the cigarette-food giant, formally signaling he has no intention of reopening the fight. `` As you well know, we have just concluded what has been a long, difficult and arduous process,'' <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said in a joint letter with <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kravis </PERSON>, a principal in the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roberts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` However, that process has ended and it is now most important that we return immediately to actively and vigorously running our business,'' said the letter, sent Friday to <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION>'s 120,000 employees worldwide. Addressing the concern of employees about their futures, the letter also attempted to assure employees them that `` all of your existing health and medical plans, and all of your retirement and pension plans will continue in full force and effect.'' The letter also said <PERSON> Kohlberg </PERSON> has `` great flexibility and is under no pressure to make immediate divestitures.'' Nevertheless, the letter confirmed press accounts that the new owner anticipated `` that the sale of $ 6 billion in various food assets is likely to occur over the next twelve to twenty-four months.'' There was no further indication of what those assets were, but the letter told employees `` we can also assure you that there will be no mass liquodations of our assets, or any mass layoff of employees. Both our goal and commitment is to grow this company in a most responsible manner.'' <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> was outmaneuvered by <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> in a spectacular bidding war for the nation's 19th largest industrial company, maker of hundreds of products that range from Camel cigarettes to Oreo cookies to Triscuit snacks. The struggle climaxed late Wednesday when <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION>'s directors accepted <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 109-a-share, $ 24.53 billion package of cash and securities, the biggest takeover agreement in history. <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> won despite a seemingly higher $ 112-a-share, $ 25.2 billion package of cash and securities offered by <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> and his financial backers, defying widespread predictions that the scrappy RJR boss would win. The directors concluded both offers were substantially the same and opted to go with the investment firm's because of its established record in takeovers and its commitment to preserving as much of the company as possible, post-mortem accounts of the decision showed. They also were said to be dismayed at the brazen greed exhibited by <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, who originally offered $ 75 a share for the company in what he admitted was a deliberate buy-low approach. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> was said to feel cheated by the board's announcement and his first reaction was to reiterate he believed his final offer was better. He also dropped hints the battle was not over, saying he was `` exploring my options.'' But the joint letter with <PERSON> Kravis </PERSON> showed he had scrapped any plans to challenge the board's decision. Both offers were for leveraged buyouts, a high-finance transaction in which the buyer puts up only a fraction of the purchase price and borrows the rest, repaying it with the target company's earnings, sale of assets or both. The highly publicized struggle focused new attention on leveraged buyouts because they saddle companies with enormous debt and often lead to their breakup. There is growing concern over whether leveraged buyouts are playing a harmful role in the economy. <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION>'s takeover of <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> will more than quadruple the company's debt to nearly $ 24 billion, raising speculation the new owner will have to sell substantial parts of the Atlanta-based giant to service that debt

 A dissident group of shareholders ended an attempt to gain control of <ORGANIZATION> Zenith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Friday, saying it was satisfied the company was taking steps to improve the value of its shares The announcement ends the takeover battle that was launched Oct. 12 by <ORGANIZATION> Brookhurst </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION>, owner of 6.1 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Zenith </ORGANIZATION>'s stock. `` The continuing efforts of <ORGANIZATION> Zenith </ORGANIZATION>'s management and board have persuaded the company's shareholders that <ORGANIZATION> Zenith </ORGANIZATION> is pursuing programs that will maximize shareholder value,'' said <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Abelow </PERSON>, a leader of <ORGANIZATION> Brookhurst </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Zenith </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pearlman </PERSON> said his company would continue discussions with other companies to find ways to bolster the stock. The company has in the past said it might consider joint ventures or the sale of some of its operations. `` We appreciate the keen interest our shareholders have shown in the future of <ORGANIZATION> Zenith </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Pearlman </PERSON> said in a statement. In their joint statement, <ORGANIZATION> Brookhurst </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Zenith </ORGANIZATION> said they had agreed to terminate all lawsuits they had pending against each other. Brookhurst, headed by stock-market speculators <PERSON> Abelow </PERSON> and <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Ihasz </PERSON>, had asked <ORGANIZATION> Zenith </ORGANIZATION> shareholders to support a plan to seize control of the company's board and, in turn, sell <ORGANIZATION> Zenith </ORGANIZATION>'s ailing consumer-electronics division <PERSON> Brookhurst </PERSON> had said that if it could n't find a buyer for the electronics unit, it would attempt to sell the entire company, which is the last major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> manufacturer of television sets. <ORGANIZATION> Zenith </ORGANIZATION>, based in the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Glenview </LOCATION>, also makes personal computers. <PERSON> Brookhurst </PERSON>'s plan called for reducing the size of <ORGANIZATION> Zenith </ORGANIZATION>'s board from 10 directors to six and replacing some directors with its own candidates. <PERSON> Brookhurst </PERSON> has cited <ORGANIZATION> Zenith </ORGANIZATION>'s dismal earnings in recent years as the reason for the unusual takeover bid. <ORGANIZATION> Zenith </ORGANIZATION> has posted multimillion-dollar losses in each of the past three years but the company reported a $ 3 million profit for the third quarter of 1988. It expects to show a pre-tax profit at the end of this year.
