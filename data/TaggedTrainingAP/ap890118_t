 Six former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Marines visited their old battleground with a man who had been their enemy, walking carefully to avoid unexploded mines laid more than 20 years ago. `` Do n't go off the road. It's very dangerous. A lot of people have been killed by mines,'' Col. <PERSON> Ho </PERSON> <PERSON> Minh </PERSON> <PERSON> Thanh </PERSON> told the Americans, who came as volunteers to help get rid of mines they had sown as young soldiers. The Americans were not carrying any equipment, but they wanted to point out likely sites where mines may be concealed. As the Marines moved out on their patrol into the past, trudging along the red dirt road of the Alpha 3 artillery base, <PERSON> Thanh </PERSON> confirmed their suspicions that mines remained, despite assurances by <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> ambassador that all had been cleared. <PERSON> Thanh </PERSON> said the region he commands in central <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> still is laden with dangerous, unexploded shells and many of the 100,000 land mines planted in the late 1960s by the 11th Marines, an engineer battalion to which five of the visitors belonged. `` We lost a lot of people, even children. People are still being injured and killed,'' <PERSON> Thanh </PERSON> said during the tour Tuesday. At another base at <LOCATION> Gio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Linh </LOCATION>, scores of poor women and children hacked in the ruins with hoes and shovels despite the danger, searching for valuable scrap metal from shell casings. <PERSON> Thanh </PERSON> said soldiers and civilians had tried to clear the mines from around <ORGANIZATION> Alpha </ORGANIZATION> 3 so rubber trees could be planted, but there were too many. He agreed with <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Spanos </PERSON>, a 39-year-old police lieutenant from <LOCATION> Rosemont </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, who organized the 10-day inspection trip, that something should be done. `` Can we go back and relay that information to your people in <LOCATION> Hanoi </LOCATION>?'' <PERSON> Spanos </PERSON> asked the colonel. `` Would that be OK?'' `` Thank you. We appreciate that,'' <PERSON> Thanh </PERSON> said. `` That's why we're here,'' said <PERSON> Spanos </PERSON>. The American reported to <PERSON> Thanh </PERSON> that the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> told him in a letter it had offered to help clear mines and dispose of unexploded shells, some fired by the North Vietnamese and some by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soldiers and their South Vietnamese allies. `` What the response was, I do n't know,'' <PERSON> Spanos </PERSON> said. `` Thank you very much for your good intentions,'' <PERSON> Thanh </PERSON> replied through the interpreter who translated their remarks for each other. On a visit by the Americans to the Vietnamese <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Mission in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> three months ago, Ambassador <PERSON> Trinh </PERSON> <PERSON> Xuan </PERSON> <PERSON> Lang </PERSON> told <PERSON> Spanos </PERSON> all the mines had been cleared but the former <ORGANIZATION> Marines </ORGANIZATION> were welcome to visit as tourists. That is how they traveled, in a van provided by the <ORGANIZATION> Vietnam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tourist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>, unofficial goodwill ambassadors whose expenses are being paid by an anonymous benefactor. `` I knew damn well not all of those mines had been taken out,'' said <PERSON> Nate </PERSON> <PERSON> Genna </PERSON>, 41, of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>. `` We laid over 100,000 in a relatively small region.'' The region included a string of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bases just below what was then the demilitarized zone dividing <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> north and south at the 17th parallel. The country was reunited by <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s victory in April 1975. `` I think there has been a reconciliation,'' <PERSON> Genna </PERSON> said. `` It's not after every war that guys come back who actually did the work and try to do something about it It's a load off my mind. I had my doubts all along. This is awful, all these years later.'' <PERSON> Spanos </PERSON> said: `` We've accomplished everything. We found out the Vietnamese would not let us off this road for our safety, and that it has been confirmed by a Vietnamese commander who served in this area who still is in the army, who is still aware and has acknowledged that there are mines in this area and people are still being injured, still being killed.'' He said he would send full reports to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Vietnamese governments saying there are serious mine problems at three of the four bases they visited: Alpha 3, <PERSON> Con </PERSON> <PERSON> Thien </PERSON> just to the west and <LOCATION> Khe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sanh </LOCATION>, where <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Marines withstood a 77-day siege in 1968. On their visit to <LOCATION> Khe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sanh </LOCATION>, the former Marines were restricted to the main road because of mines and unexploded shells. <PERSON> Spanos </PERSON> said his report would call attention to the dangers of <PERSON> Gio </PERSON> <PERSON> Linh </PERSON>, the easternmost base, where the women and children risked death for a possible prize. Their journey stirred memories for the Americans. Marines put the first protective shield of mines around Alpha 3 at Christmas 1967, said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, 41, of <LOCATION> Manchester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Noe </PERSON>, 40, of <LOCATION> Stoughton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, looked at the red dirt and said: `` There was a lot of heavy combat at this base, as there was at <PERSON> Con </PERSON> <PERSON> Thien </PERSON> and Gio Linh ... We ran operations along the <ORGANIZATION> DMZ </ORGANIZATION>. A lot of guys died up around here.'' His voice trailed off and he he walked away to weep alone.

 <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> will not bargain with convicted killer <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> to delay his scheduled execution in exchange for details of several unsolved murders in other states, Gov. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> said Wednesday. An attorney and adviser for <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON>, scheduled to be executed Tuesday, asked for a reprieve of up to three years so <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> could talk to law officers. Officials from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> have asked to interview Bundy but have not sought any delay. Before his capture in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> was on the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s most-wanted list as a suspect in as many as 36 sex-related murders or disappearances of young women in the <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>. The governor, who signed <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON>'s death warrant Tuesday shortly after the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> refused to hear his appeal in the 1978 murder of a 12-year-old <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> girl, said <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> was once again trying to foil justice. `` We're not going to have the system manipulated,'' said <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>. `` One of the things to be made clear here to law enforcement, which I think they realize more than anyone else what <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> has done, is you do n't negotiate with a murderer. You do n't negotiate with a killer.'' He promised to make Bundy available to any law agency in the days remaining before his execution. <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON>'s civil attorney, <PERSON> Diana </PERSON> <PERSON> Weiner </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Sarasota </LOCATION>, told the governor's death-penalty lawyer, <PERSON> Andrea </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> <PERSON> Hillyer </PERSON>, that <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> was committed to revealing all he knew about unsolved murders. <PERSON> Weiner </PERSON> did n't specify about which cases he had information. `` <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> feels morally compelled as he faces death to do the right thing in terms of resolving any investigations,'' she said. `` While it may satisfyingly close the book on the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> cases, the immediate execution will effectively cripple law enforcement agencies around the country.'' <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> said he had no patience for any more appeals. `` He has been in jail for 11 years. He certainly could have come clean in other occasions, but he has used the court. Now all of a sudden, he wants to tell the truth,'' said <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> always has insisted that he is innocent of any murder. <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON>, 42, also is under death sentences for fatally bludgeoning two <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> sorority sisters. <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> attorney, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON>, said he's not involved in any attempt to delay the execution by talking about other cases, but was planning an appeal on the question of <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON>'s sanity <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> filed an emergency appeal through state <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, and a hearing has been scheduled for Thursday morning, a court clerk said. <PERSON> Hillyer </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Keppel </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state attorney general's office planned to talk with <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON>, who is suspected in up to 20 killings and more closely linked to eight killings in that state. She added that an official from the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Violent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crime </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Quantico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, wanted to interview <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON>. In <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayward </PERSON> said he is sending Detective <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Couch </PERSON> to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> on Saturday in hopes of interviewing <LOCATION> Bundy </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hayward </PERSON> said he hoped <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION> law student, could help authorities locate the bodies of any <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> victims. `` He has n't indicated he'd say a word to us, but there's always that long shot, that last-second chance that he'll say ` Ah, bring them in, let's see what's on their minds,''' <PERSON> Hayward </PERSON> said. Also announced Wednesday was <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON>'s decision, reversing himself, to grant a news media interview, and <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON>'s request for a personal interview with <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Dobson </PERSON>, host of a <LOCATION> Pomona </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, - based radio show called `` Focus on the Family. <PERSON> Dobson </PERSON> said he has exchanged letters with <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> for the past two years. He did n't know what <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> might want to talk about but hoped that if <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> has information about any other killings he would reveal it to help ease the victims' families. `` When a man is looking death in the face, he does n't waste words and I want to hear what he has to say,'' said <PERSON> Dobson </PERSON>, who said his 30-minute radio show is carried on 1,300 stations in 26 countries.

 About 2,500 wealthy Republican partisans, unmindful of chanting protesters outside, feasted on a $ 1,500-a-plate dinner of <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> crab and mushroom-stuffed veal Wednesday night and cheered <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s declaration that `` I'm gon na try my level best to be a good president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The president-elect and his vice president-to-be, <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, toured three black-tie inaugural dinners two days before they take the oath of office, and by the time they reached their final stop at Union Station, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, with a laugh, that `` We're exhausted.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> thanked the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> faithful for helping him get elected Nov. 8 and for their financial support that opened the four days of inaugural festivities to thousands of `` just plain folks.'' `` I hope you enjoy the celebration,'' he said. `` We've earned it together.'' After he was toasted with champagne and serenaded by the Whiffenpoofs, the famed glee club from his <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> alma mater, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> drew a roar of approval from the crowd when he said he would try to be a good president and `` work for all the people of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' Said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>: `` You've given me a chance and I'm not going to let you down.'' Then <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> stepped down from the podium and shook hands with scores of well-wishers followed by his wife, <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON>, and the Quayles, during their half-hour appearance. Before the dinner started, several hundred protesters demonstrated outside Union Station for three hours and chanted at arriving limousines `` Food For The Poor, Not The Rich,'' and `` What About The Homeless?'' Inside Union Station, the black-tie guests expressed little concern about the message the demonstraters were shouting. `` I feel it's ridiculous,'' said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> business executive. `` They hold these staged events every time Republicans get together and it's in very poor taste.'' `` The people here have probably contributed more as individuals and corporations to the welfare of this country than anybody else,'' said <LOCATION> Tulsa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Okla. </LOCATION>, oilman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hewgley </PERSON>. `` If they want to celebrate, then, by <PERSON> God </PERSON>, they're entitled to.'' Several hundred protesters demonstrated for three hours, shouting at the limousines that pulled up to the main entrance at Union Station with inaugural dinner guests, but dispersed peaceably as the dinner began in mid-evening. Three hours before the start of the Union Station dinner, several hundred street people enjoyed a `` counter Inaugural banquet'' of hot chili and rice, tortilla chips, salad and apple cider on the plaza in front of Union Station. While they ate off of paper plates, the homeless listened to guitar players and watched a pro-abortion street theater featuring a man in tennis shoes wearing a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> mask and a sign reading, `` I oppose abortion'' hanging around his neck. Protesters organized by a group called, `` The Counter-Inaugural Coalition for a Peoples' Agenda,'' carried placards reading, `` Food, Not Bombs,'' `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Knew </PERSON>'' and `` The Skies Are for Stars, Not War.'' Another sign under a huge peace symbol read, `` Now Appearing In a Four-Year Show, Son of <LOCATION> Reaganstein </LOCATION>, co-starring Big Bird.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> were guests of honor at the lavish dinners attended by more than 2,500 Republican stalwarts and fat-cat contributors. The black-tie crowd was so large the dinners were held at Union Station and the nearby Pension Building and Corcoran Gallery of Art. For $ 1,500 ticket, each invited guest was to hear brief remarks by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> at the three dinner sites and feast on a four-course dinner. Outside of Union Station, Park Police Sgt. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kass </PERSON> banished a half dozen conservative Republican counter-demonstrators for lack of a permit. The leader of the group, <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Delgaudio </PERSON>, 34, executive director of the private, ultra-conservative activists group known as `` Public Advocate,'' said he wanted to show `` there's a better way than openly, political negativism.'' He said his demonstrators were to welcome the black-tie dinner guests with <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> flags and signs reading, `` Welcome Non-Liberals.'' Several homeless people paused between spoonfuls of chili to say that the $ 2.25 million in proceeds from the inaugural dinners should be spent to provide food, additional shelters, job training and subsidized public transportation for <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s street people. Referring to the inaugural diners, <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON> <PERSON> Carrington </PERSON>, a 30-year-old homeless person, said, `` I think maybe they should eat the same thing we're having so they'll know what it's like.'' Said <PERSON> Ronnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, 38: `` They done robbed most of it from us.'' He said the inaugural dinner proceeds should be used for the homeless because `` a lot of them have given up.'' More than 1,000 people were served at the counter-inaugural dinner at Union Station. As guests began arriving shortly before 7 p.m., several hundred of the people at the counter-inaugural banquet began shouting, `` What about the homeless'' and `` 50,000 dead from AIDS. Where was <PERSON> George </PERSON>?'' Although the Park Police allowed the demonstration to spread closer to the train depot than the demonstrators' permit allowed, the protestors remained 100 yards from the entrance where the invited guests were emerging from their cars and were barely audible from that distance. At about 7:30 p.m., one half hour before the Union Station banquet would get officially underway, the Park Police received reinforcement and barricades which were set up in front of the demonstrators. Park Police Sgt. <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON>, asked whether the barricades had been planned in advance, said, `` I'm not in on these decisions, but I imagine it was spontaneous because of the crowd's activity ... we ca n't have the police spread out or people can sneak through. We should have had them up there before.'' There was no indication that any of the invited guests to the Union Station dinner were even aware of the demonstration. None of them came over to see what is going on. At the majestic <ORGANIZATION> Corcoran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gallery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION>, dinner guests who also paid $ 1,500 each were serenaded up a royal blue carpeted stairway by violins playing, `` This Could Be The Start of Something Big.'' Elegantly attired guests wandered through art displays ranging from modern neon art to traditional American pieces. The gallery was hung with blue bunting with white stars and large arrangements of red roses decorated the corridors. Among the guests at the Corcoran gala dinner were <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s longtime friend and Commerce secretary-designate, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON>'s socialite wife <PERSON> Georgette </PERSON>. Mrs. <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON>, like Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Mrs. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was dressed in a black-and-white gown. Also among the guests were Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Warner </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Va </LOCATION>., and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s son, <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON>, and his wife, The younger <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he was having fun, but mostly waiting for Friday's swearing in of his father. `` The rest will be fun,'' he said, adding, however, `` the one we will all be looking forward to will be Friday - an incredibly proud moment for all of us.'' His wife, who wore a fitted, strapless black gown with a brocade bodice, said she had never seen <PERSON> George </PERSON> and <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> so excited as they have been with the inauguration approaching. `` They're like two kids,'' she said.

 Once a little city with clean, if rainy, skies and clear mountain views, fast-growing <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> has become a metropolis with the usual smog and traffic jams. Some people are starting to protest. A citizens group turned in 18,000 signatures on an initiative to limit the height and density of downtown buildings, and debate is gearing up before a vote this spring. The building boom is easy to see, and much of it has occurred in the past decade. Three skyscrapers are under construction, and permit applications for three more were submitted before a recently imposed six-month moratorium on downtown growth. The 55-story <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mutual </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tower </ORGANIZATION> was completed last year, bumping the 50-story 1001 Fourth Avenue Plaza to third tallest. No. 1 is the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>'s tallest building, the 76-story black-glass <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seafirst </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> built in 1985, before downtown zoning went into effect. A dozen office towers are 30 stories or more, and all but three were opened in the 1980s. The thousands of workers in these buildings, plus tourists and shoppers, make downtown <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> a lively place. Fishmongers, farmers' stalls, crafts booths and restaurants compete shoulder-to-shoulder at the historic, hectic Pike Place Market. Redevelopment is continuing at the downtown waterfront. And the downtown retail core, with major flagship department stores and a variety of small businesses, recently settled one 30-year-old land-use debate with the opening of <ORGANIZATION> Westlake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, a new mall of expensive shops and a 24-story office tower. Supporters of the Citizens Alternative Plan to Downtown Development, or CAP, say overdevelopment in downtown will mean more pollution as more people commute by car and more box-like apartment buildings replace single-family houses and dilute the flavor of old city neighborhoods. CAP wants to limit building height to about 40 stories in the office district. New office floor space would be limited to 500,000 square feet a year for the next five years and 1 million square feet a year from 1995 through 1999. After that, the ceiling would be lifted unless re-imposed by the <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. By contrast, nearly 6 million square feet of downtown office space is newly completed, under construction or has received city permits, said <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Galle </LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> member and CAP supporter. At the present rate of growth, in 10 years some 67,000 new office workers are expected to occupy 52,000 new households and make 29,000 more car trips daily into downtown, she said. There is no height limit under the city's current zoning plan. A building's size is worked out according to a formula based on the size of the site, with extra height allowed in exchange for such amenities as plazas, retail space and day care centers. CAP supporters insist they want growth, but not at a high cost to the environment and the neighborhoods. `` We're not anti-growth in the traditional sense,'' says <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Strosahl </PERSON>, a jeweler and president of <ORGANIZATION> Vision </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seattle </ORGANIZATION>, which supports CAP. `` We're really much more into shaping growth so that it produces and accentuates the livability of the city.'' Some participants in the growth debate argue the city needs controls that are more lenient than the CAP initiative. Mayor <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Royer </PERSON> presented a plan of his own that would limit office towers to about 50 stories. It would stiffen the zoning code, but not as much as CAP would. <PERSON> Royer </PERSON> also wants to adjust the bonus system used to allow developers to build higher. His plan would shift the emphasis of the bonuses from street-level amenities to housing, human services and open space. The <ORGANIZATION> Downtown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seattle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, a group of developers and business executives, contends the 1985 zoning law is strict enough. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilmore </PERSON>, president of the association, says downtown growth makes more sense than spreading development into neighborhods and suburbs. A downtown provides a focal point for a rapid-transit system, something <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> needs, he said. And <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> must grow, he contended. `` We're having childen like every other part of the country and there's got to be jobs.'' <PERSON> Folke </PERSON> <PERSON> Nyberg </PERSON>, a professor of urban planning and architecture at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION>, agreed <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>'s location on the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rim </LOCATION> means it will grow, but disagreed that concentrated downtown growth is good. <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> has an `` hour-glass'' figure, squeezed between Puget Sound and <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, he said. `` So there are some very limited physical constraints that makes it imperative that we have an effective transportation solution before we allow growth to happen, and this was not done.'' A better way to grow, <PERSON> Nyberg </PERSON> said, would be in decentralized clusters throughout the region. People in these smaller cities would live near their jobs and go to downtown <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> mainly for conventions and cultural events. Instead, unplanned growth can be seen in declining air quality, traffic congestion and more homelessness caused by a lack of afforable housing, he said. <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, which `` has been a very livable city,'' he said, failed to learn from other cities' mistakes. Asked why, he replied, `` It's all greed. The growth-control initiative goes before voters May 16, the <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> decided last week. <PERSON> Gilmore </PERSON>, of the <ORGANIZATION> Downtown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seattle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said that the city's 1985 downtown zoning was the product of four years of debate and that any changes should be made through more hearings and <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> votes. The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Architects </ORGANIZATION>' local chapter agrees. CAP supporters, however, say their plan is reasonable and timely. According to <PERSON> Strosahl </PERSON>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> needed to enact stiffer downtown limits in 1986 because it waited too long, until the cost of housing went way up and the character of the city changed. <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> voters approved the limits after a building spree in which 25 million square feet of office space was added between 1979 and 1984. The high rises nearly blocked out all the sun in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>'s financial district. <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>'s voter-approved plan limits new office space to 475,000 square feet for several years for a city with a population of 690,000. That compares with CAP's limits of 500,000 square feet for five years and 1 million square feet for the next five in a city of 490,000. <PERSON> Gilmore </PERSON> suggests people who signed CAP did not really want to limit growth, but were just annoyed with traffic disruption downtown caused by construction of a downtown bus tunnel and a state convention center. The initiative text was long and complicated, and people probably did not read it, he said. What's more, the petition had just 329 more signatures than it needed. <PERSON> Strosahl </PERSON> thinks voters will pass the initiative, but he expects a highly financed campaign against it.

 The sinking New Year's Eve of an overcrowded tourist boat off <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Janeiro </LOCATION> has sparked a nationwide outcry against what many Brazilians feel is the impunity of the rich and powerful and a general disrespect for law. In public demonstrations, Brazilians have made the tragedy, in which 52 passengers and crew died, a forum to rail against a widespread sense that in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> people in the right places can get away with lawbreaking _ from running red lights to hiring professional killers. `` Some of the worst vices of the Brazilian soul came to light the moment the boat sank: facility to bribe, irresponsibility and the failure to assist fellow citizens in trouble,'' the newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Jornal </ORGANIZATION> do Brasil of <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Janeiro </LOCATION> said in an editorial. There has been no accurate count of the number of revelers on the Bateau Mouche when it capsized and sank on its way to an annual fireworks display off <LOCATION> Copacabana </LOCATION> beach. A widely accepted figure is 150. The flat-bottomed river boat was built to carry 20 passengers. Survivors claim it was dangerously overcrowded and listing badly in rough water and that lifejackets were not readily accessible. There are accusations _ as yet unproved _ that <ORGANIZATION> Port </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> guards who inspected the Bateau Mouche just two hours before it went down were paid off to allow it to venture into the open sea. The navy and the police are bickering over which group should investigate the sinking. There is widespread fear that no one will be held responsible _ as happened so often before here in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s largest country, in highway and maritime tragedies, fires and collapses of buildings and freeways. In 1981, for example, two riverboat sinkings in <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> waters claimed about 500 lives. Both resulted from overcrowding, yet no one was ever prosecuted. `` The sinking of the Bateau Mouche is a portrait of our reality,'' political commentator <PERSON> Alexandre </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> said in a syndicated newspaper column. `` We were already irresponsible, now we are becoming inhuman.'' `` There is a cultural tradition of disregarding security norms, of negligence,'' said <PERSON> Evaristo </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Moraes </PERSON>, a lawyer for the owners of the Bateau Mouche. `` We need to look at our mentality, which believes that laws are always flexible.'' <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Moraes </PERSON> added, however, that in the case of the boat disaster, `` I am convinced my clients had no responsibility whatsoever.'' Indeed, one of the owners of the boat initially told reporters that `` panic among the passengers'' was the cause of the tragedy. <PERSON> Paulo </PERSON> <PERSON> Soares </PERSON>, a son-in-law of the Bateau Mouche's 50-year-old captain, <PERSON> Camilo </PERSON> <PERSON> da </PERSON> <PERSON> Costa </PERSON>, who drowned, told the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION>, `` <PERSON> Camilo </PERSON> did n't want to go out He called us to say the boat was overloaded and the sea was too rough. But he had no choice. He would lose his job if he did n't sail.'' Brazilians are proud of what they call `` jeitinho,'' or a `` little way'' of cutting through red tape, avoiding a traffic ticket or eliminating a problem that has become intertwined with self-definitions of national character. There is a whole professional category known as `` despachantes,'' whose job consists basically of paying off the right people. A recent prime-time TV soap opera, `` Vale Tudo -LRB- Anything Goes -RRB-, drew ratings of 80 percent with its portrayals of greed, conniving, corruption and deceit among it principal characters. But it is n't exclusively a lack of respect for laws that has generated a sense of impunity in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, said Deputy Justice Minister <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Eichenberg </PERSON>. `` This also has grown from a tremendous lack of human and material resources,'' he said. `` We often are physically and financially unable to enforce the law.'' Many Brazilians are determined that the Bateau Mouche case not be forgotten. Theater and movie personalities _ outraged by the drowning of the well-known actress <PERSON> Yara </PERSON> <PERSON> Amaral </PERSON> _ along with <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> city </LOCATION> councilmen and other well known figures have organized to demand that police determine responsibility in the sinking. Brazilians also have rallied around the shooting death in December of the internationally known ecologist <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Mendes </PERSON>, who sought to defend the <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION>'s ecology and its poor peasants against the interests of powerful landowners. Many employ private gunmen to eliminate enemies. According to <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, the London-based human rights organization, about 1,000 peasants, ecologists and <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> priests, who defend landless farmers, have been killed in land disputes in <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> since 1980. Only three cases have been prosecuted, the organization says.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> returns to his beloved <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> as the toast of <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>, reinvigorating the social scene with the stature of a popular two-term president who never forgot his show business past. <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> and <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> do n't hide their eagerness to step out of the national spotlight and re-enter a private world among friends. The president has said: `` Every time I come home I say to myself, ` Why did I ever leave?''' Their affluent friends are no less eager. `` It's tough to beat a former president living in your midst. They are now going to be the superstars in the <LOCATION> Bel-Air </LOCATION> circuit,'' entertainment industry observer <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Archerd </ORGANIZATION> said. `` Hollywood feels it sent one of its own to the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and now he's returned as the most popular president in history. He's one of us,'' said TV producer <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Willenborg </PERSON>. <PERSON> Merv </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Barron </PERSON> <PERSON> Hilton </PERSON> set the social tone by throwing a $ 25,000-a-table homecoming gala earlier this month. The <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION> will be a star attraction Feb. 23 at the <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s Hope Award presentations honoring <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> and a Valentine's Day party is on tap for Mrs. `` They will really re-invigorate things,'' dance man <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> predicted. <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> said the social calendar is already topsy-turvy. `` I'm sure they will be the leaders of everything that happens here,'' he said. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> never forgot <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>, where he starred in motion pictures and led the <ORGANIZATION> Screen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Actors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guild </ORGANIZATION>. Throughout his eight years in the White House he delighted in spinning show business yarns. There are those who hope <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s fondness for his old vocation will lead him back to the screen. Actress <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON> said a script has been written for <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to play her ex-husband on `` Dynasty'' if he chooses, and <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> suggested the Reagans might make a movie together. But one longtime <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> friend said television and movies are n't part of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> post-presidential agenda `` I think the idea of him being interested in an acting career is absurd,'' said the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> confidant, who spoke on condition that his name be withheld. `` I do n't think he will do anything in entertainment.'' However, the same source said the nation may hear <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on Saturday morning radio again, expressing his thoughts and opinions on issues facing the country. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> expects to be inundated with requests to make speeches on `` the mashed-potato circuit'' and has offered himself up as a foot soldier in what he calls the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> <PERSON> Brigade </PERSON> of his successor's supporters He and Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> also have plans to write memoirs and push their pet causes. Not everyone is happy the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION> are back in town. Residents of <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> View </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Terrace </LOCATION>, 20 miles north of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, have been fighting to keep the <ORGANIZATION> Nancy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reagan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> for drug rehabilitation out of their neighborhood. Homeowners fear the center, an extension of Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s `` Just Say No'' anti-drug crusade, will bring addicts into the area and endanger residents. During the recent <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> welcome-home gala, which raised $ 1 million for the center, residents marched outside with signs reading, `` If you really care, put it in <LOCATION> Bel-Air </LOCATION>.'' That affluent hillside enclave is the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s new neighborhood. Although they are keeping their <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barbara </LOCATION> ranch as a retreat, they intend to spend most of their time in their new $ 2.5 million <LOCATION> Bel-Air </LOCATION> home. Perched in hills among $ 10 million-plus mansions, the 6,500-square-foot ranch-style home is modest by neighborhood standards. Little can be seen behind an electronic iron gate leading to 668 Saint Cloud Rd. A guard shack was constructed recently, a chain link fence was thrown up over vintage stone walls and roof-mounted cameras scan the property. The address was changed last summer from 666 Saint Cloud because of connotations surrounding the number 666, believed by some to be the symbol of the devil. Tourists clutching $ 5 maps to stars' homes ply the winding roads aboard tour vans or in rental cars. So far, little notice has been paid to the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> house _ the real stars are the `` Beverly Hillbillies'' mansion and the home of entertainer <PERSON> Zsa </PERSON> <PERSON> Zsa </PERSON> <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON>.

 <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> has lengthened its compulsory military service from 15 months to 18 months, a move the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> say could jeopardize East-West disarmament efforts.

The Social Democrats also point to a lessened threat from the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc. The armed forces now have about 495,000 members. Men aged 18 through 28 are subject to be drafted and about half of those in service are draftees.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Oklahoma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday reversed a $ 390,000 judgment won by a woman who was publicly branded by her church for having sex outside of marriage. But the court left open the possibility that the woman could recover damages for actions taken by church elders after she sought to withdraw from membership in the church. The <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> court ruled <PERSON> Marian </PERSON> <PERSON> Guinn </PERSON> could not recover for any civil wrongs committed against her by church elders while she was still a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Collinsville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christ </ORGANIZATION>. Justice <PERSON> Marian </PERSON> <PERSON> Opala </PERSON> wrote the majority opinion sending the case back for a new trial. Four other justices concurred, two dissented and two others dissented in part. <PERSON> Opala </PERSON>'s opinion held that the First Amendment did not protect church elders from potential liability for acts that occurred after the woman withdrew her church membership. The decision said it could be found that the elders went `` beyond the bounds of decency'' by going against the woman's wishes and announcing to the congregation the woman's `` sin of fornication'' when she declined to publicly repent. `` We hence hold there is competent evidence to support the jury's conclusion that the elders had intended to inflict emotional harm on parishioner,'' the opinion said Elders of the <LOCATION> Collinsville </LOCATION> church, located north of <LOCATION> Tulsa </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> northeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, filed the appeal after a <LOCATION> Tulsa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> jury in March 1984 awarded Ms. <PERSON> Guinn </PERSON> $ 205,000 actual damages and $ 185,000 punitive damages. The registered nurse and divorced mother of four sued in 1981, when elders of the church disclosed she had committed the `` sin of fornication.'' The church argued elders had a right, outlined in the Bible, to discipline members. The elders were identified in the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling as <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitten </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Moody </PERSON> and <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> Cash. The court said the woman had implored the elders in a letter not to mention her name in church, except to say she had withdrawn from membership. The elders told the woman that withdrawing from the church was not possible and could not halt disciplinary action against her.

 The 26-year-old drifter with a long criminal record who launched a mute, murderous assault on a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> elementary school Tuesday was described by his aunt as a loner and childhood alcoholic, police said. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Purdy </PERSON> purchased an AK-47 rifle in this <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION> suburb several months ago, then returned to his hometown of <LOCATION> Stockton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, where he used the gun to kill five children and wound 29 others, along with a teacher, at <ORGANIZATION> Cleveland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> before taking his own life, authorities said. <PERSON> Purdy </PERSON>, who went by the alias of <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> West </PERSON>, had lived with an aunt and uncle in <PERSON> Sandy </PERSON> from the first of July until late October, said <PERSON> Sandy </PERSON> Police Chief <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Punzel </PERSON>. He later moved to <LOCATION> Lodi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, where he listed his mailing address under the name of his grandmother, <PERSON> Julia </PERSON> <PERSON> Chumbley </PERSON>, although he did not live with her, authorities said. `` I'm shocked. It's just horrible. I do n't understand why and I probably wo n't ever know why,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Chumbley </PERSON>, a 63-year-old retired cannery worker. `` It troubles me to think that such a terrible thing can happen.

 Looting and vandalism spread Tuesday and eight people were shot, one fatally, in the second day of rioting sparked by the fatal shooting of an unarmed black motorcyclist by a white policeman. Schools were closed, a professional basketball game was canceled, and some fans were stranded in the arena. Snipers fired at police, who cordoned off a 130-block area of the predominantly black <LOCATION> Overtown </LOCATION> neighborhood. After nightfall, authorities told law-abiding citizens to remain indoors and began a block-by-blok sweep. `` For the sake of our city, I appeal to every citizen regardless of race to stay calm, get off the streets and stay in your homes, said <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Xavier </PERSON> <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON> in a televised appeal Tuesday night. `` We are arresting people and we are being a lot more aggressive in the enforcement of the law and I think we have to be,'' <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON> added. `` I do n't think this will continue after today.'' Authorities said <LOCATION> Overtown </LOCATION>, just north of downtown, was largely quiet after police entered. By 11:30 p.m., about 150 people had been arrested, mostly for looting. But the violence already had spread to <LOCATION> Liberty </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, a separate black community several miles to the northwest, where looting and gunfire continued Tuesday night. Police said they made an arrest in the fatal shooting of a young black man in <LOCATION> Liberty </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> at 10:20 p.m., but had n't determined if it was related to the rioting. Officer <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Butler </PERSON>, wearing a bulletproof vest, was shot in the vest at 9:30 p.m. by a sniper who was later arrested on top of a three-story building. <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> was not seriously injured. Plans were made for up to 500 National Guard troops to be mobilized within two hours if the violence continued, said <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Ballard </PERSON>, a spokesman for Gov. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>. Top police officials said the tough stance would not bring a violent reaction because only a few people were violating the law. Trouble erupted again Tuesday afternoon when a white man in a luxury car reportedly fired into a crowd of blacks in the area, wounding one person before driving away. `` All I know is that one person was hit in the side,'' police spokesman <PERSON> Angelo </PERSON> <PERSON> Bitsis </PERSON> said, adding that the unidentified victim was hospitalized in fair condition. Sporadic gunfire continued throughout the day. Police said officers rescued one shooting victim while under fire, returned fire at another man, injuring him in the leg, and shot an alleged sniper in the leg. Another man was shot in the thigh in a gun battle between two men in a store and a gang of looters. Later, a man with a bullet wound in his leg was arrested when he showed up at a hospital for treatment. An eighth person was shot in the leg in <LOCATION> Liberty </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. About 25 youths shattered car windows outside the <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arena </LOCATION> on the border of <LOCATION> Overtown </LOCATION>, where the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Basketball </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heat </ORGANIZATION> was scheduled to play the <ORGANIZATION> Phoenix </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Suns </ORGANIZATION> Tuesday night The game was canceled. A meat truck was looted and one white motorist was beaten after his car broke down in <LOCATION> Overtown </LOCATION>. The car of <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> photographer <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Pesetsky </PERSON> was burned and he was roughed up by a mob but not seriously hurt when he attempted to take pictures of the crowd that had gathered near the site of Tuesday's shooting. Police fired tear gas at the crowd and in turn were pelted by rocks and bottles. They then sealed off a several block area and shots could be heard from within. `` I saw someone coming around a building and throwing rocks, and I said ` Let's go, get out of here,''' <PERSON> Pesetsky </PERSON> said. At least one car also was burned in <LOCATION> Liberty </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> announced that it would open an investigation into Monday night's shooting to determine whether there were civil rights violations, <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> bureau spokesman <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiszynski </PERSON> said. `` I ca n't tell you how long it will take, but it will be an extensive and thorough investigation and it will be done as promptly as possible,'' <PERSON> Kiszynski </PERSON> said. Meanwhile, a passenger on the motorcycle who was injured when the driver crashed into a car after the shooting died Tuesday at <ORGANIZATION> Jackson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> of massive head injuries, spokeswoman <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Baderman </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON>, one of the targets of rock and bottle throwing Monday night, spent Tuesday meeting with black leaders and residents of <LOCATION> Overtown </LOCATION>, a neighborhood of rundown, low-slung apartment buildings and trash-strewn vacant lots, just north of downtown <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. `` People are angry, people want a full explanation of what happened,'' said <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON>, who also expressed particular concern about the damage to <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>'s image less than a week before the city is host to the Super Bowl. At least two buildings and three cars were burned in the rioting, which broke out about two hours after a white police officer shot and killed a black motorcyclist being chased for a traffic infraction. No damage estimates were available. Authorities said seven civilians and three of the 280 police officers called to the scene were injured. Police guarded a 130-block area of <LOCATION> Overtown </LOCATION> on Tuesday, warning motorists who passed through that they could not be guaranteed protection. Six schools were closed and some buses were rerouted, but authorities refused to declare an evening curfew. The disturbance recalled the bloody 1980 riot in adjacent <LOCATION> Liberty </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> that also was linked to the death of a black motorcyclist at the hands of white officers. A similar disturbance broke out in 1982 when a black man was shot to death only a few blocks from where the latest incident began. On Monday, <PERSON> Clement </PERSON> <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON>, 23, died following a police chase that started just after 6 p.m. <PERSON> Bitsis </PERSON> said <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> and a passenger on his motorcycle sped past a police officer, who gave chase. Then the motorcycle headed down a street where another officer, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON>, was taking a report from a crime victim. `` He heard the radio transmission and saw the motorcycle coming in his direction,'' <PERSON> Bitsis </PERSON> said. `` As the motorcycle either approached him or went by him, he fired his shot.'' The bullet hit <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> in the head, killing him, and the motorcycle then crashed into a car. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON>, 24, a passenger on the motorcycle, died Tuesday. By 8 p.m. an angry crowd had surrounded the police and news media vehicles gathered at the spot, and the violence began, with rocks and bottles thrown at police, reporters and their cars. Crowds of up to 100 people roamed the streets, smashing windshields, burning vehicles, looting some stores and occasionally firing weapons at police. <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON>, 29, a four-year veteran of the force, was automatically suspended with pay pending an investigation into whether he used excessive force. Many in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>'s black community said they were tired of police violence, saying nothing has changed despite promises by <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON> and other officials who courted black votes. <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON> strongly denied that the attention paid to newly arriving Nicaraguan refugees had created ill-will in the black community, but black leaders did not agree. `` In this tremendous influx of refugees from Central and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, the African-Americans have felt cheated. We felt we were losing our place in the city,'' said <PERSON> Johnnie </PERSON> <PERSON> McMillian </PERSON>, president of the <LOCATION> Miami-Dade </LOCATION> branch of the <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION>. The scene of Monday's disturbance was about 15 miles from <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Robbie </PERSON> <PERSON> Stadium </PERSON>, site of the Super Bowl. But the <ORGANIZATION> Cincinnati </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bengals </ORGANIZATION> are staying less than a mile away, at the Omni Hotel.

<HEAD>Easy To Purchase AK-47 in Oregon, California</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: CORRECTS gunman's name to Purdy in 2nd graf and fixes style

Angeles area.</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A semiautomatic rifle such as the AK-47 that was used in the <LOCATION> Stockton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, school shootings Tuesday can be easily purchased at <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> gun stores _ without even the waiting period required to buy a handgun. The gunman, identified by police as <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Purdy </PERSON>, had bought the rifle from the <ORGANIZATION> Sandy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trading </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> on Aug. 3, according to <ORGANIZATION> Sandy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> Chief <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Punzel </PERSON>. Authorities say <PERSON> Purdy </PERSON> opened fire in an elementary school yard, killing five youngsters and wounding 30 people before killing himself. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Imel </PERSON>, owner of PAWS gun shop in <LOCATION> Salem </LOCATION>, said there is no waiting period under <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> law to buy rifles or shotguns, unless they are fully automatic. There is a five-day wait to buy a handgun, while police agencies check for criminal records. A buyer is required to sign a form issued by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alcohol </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Firearms </ORGANIZATION>. The form requires the buyer to provide identification and attest that he is not under indictment, has not been convicted of a crime punishable by more than a year in prison and is not a fugitive from justice. A buyer also must attest that he is not an unlawful user of narcotics, has not been found mentally defective or been committed to a mental instutition, has not been discharged dishonorably from the armed forces, is not an illegal alien and has not renounced <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizenship. People must be at least 18 to purchase rifles and shotguns and 21 to buy handguns. There are some other requirements, including that a prospective buyer not have been adjudged mentally ill or be an ex-convict, <PERSON> Imel </PERSON> said. Purchases of automatic weapons are more complicated, he said, because federal law requires extensive background checks and registration of the weapons. The procedure usually takes several months before a buyer can receive the gun, <PERSON> Imel </PERSON> said. In <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, anyone can purchase a semiautomatic weapon by completing a form and showing a driver's license or other proof of residency in the state. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Deputy Attorney General <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashby </PERSON> said that even in legal semiautomatic condition, an AK-47 can fire at a rate of 400 rounds per minute, and that conversion to automatic firing, while illegal, is relatively easy on many semiautomatic models. Sales of the Soviet-designed AK-47s have become intensely controversial in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> because of their use by the increasingly violent street gangs in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and other communities. In the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> area, models of the AK-47 that have been manufactured in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> sell from $ 299 to $ 329 at sporting goods stores, and are often advertised on sale.

 Through her window, she can see the tourists on <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> Avenue gawking through the wrought-iron fence at the White House. She can scan the stream of visitors arriving to see the president. She sits at the center of a universe of prime ministers, senators and heroic warriors who will headline the evening news. For only one more day, <PERSON> Leslye </PERSON> <PERSON> Arsht </PERSON> will sit in the little cubicle in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wing </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, dealing with the affairs of _ and sometimes speaking for _ the president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Then, at the stroke of 12 on Friday, she turns in her pass and is out. `` There's life after the White House,'' says Ms. <PERSON> Arsht </PERSON>, her voice the least bit uncertain. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, a company town if there ever was one, 4,307 <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration jobs are up for grabs. Some who hold those jobs will stay where they are, but many more, like <PERSON> Leslye </PERSON> <PERSON> Arsht </PERSON>, find themselves on the job market. It is the friendliest of takeovers, this quadrennial rite, compared to the agony that occurs when a Democrat turns the White House over to a Republican, or vice versa. Not for 156 years has a president handed the reins to the man who served him as vice president. Yet, while the Bushites are n't exactly storming the gates, it's a traumatic time for many. As <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> flies off into the sunset, he leaves behind many loyal workers who wonder why they are suddenly out, while others stay on. The answer, of course, is that people work hard in a campaign, and the jobs that serve as rewards are in great demand. `` We had our turn; now it's their turn,'' says Ms. <PERSON> Arsht </PERSON>, who came from the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> two years ago with <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> when he became <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s spokesman. She has been deputy press secretary, a job that will go to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>. `` I'm a Texan, a lifetime supporter of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>,'' she says. `` It's a bittersweet time.'' Outside her door in the White House press office is a huge box being filled with files for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Archives </ORGANIZATION>. The work of the press office goes on, but it's obvious that things are being readied for the big change. On Friday, the rooms will be mostly empty, the cupboards bare, the walls nude. It wo n't be as stark as, say, when <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> left town eight years ago, because <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> will stay on to serve <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as chief spokesman. In one part of the office, a cardboard box is marked `` Do not throw away. This is not trash.'' In the hallway, a photo gallery that has been dominated by pictures of <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> and <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has undergone a subtle turn: The pictures of the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION> have been augmented by photos of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. One of those who is leaving is <PERSON> Connie </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerrard </PERSON>, the closest thing the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> has to an institutional memory. Ms. <PERSON> Gerrard </PERSON> came into the White House 25 years ago with <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, as a fresh-from-college secretary after the assassination of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>. She has stayed, serving as the press secretary's secretary, through <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>, <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, and she is ready to live a life without the endless workdays and the constant crises. `` I now want to be able to control my own schedule,'' she says. She knows what the incoming <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> staffers will soon learn, that `` in the press office, you have to hit the ground running. There is nothing to prepare you for what you find when you get here.'' Indeed, reporters were pressing <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> on Tuesday about where they will get information after noon on Friday. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> and <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> will be the only veteran hands remaining in the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration. The rest of the press office staff will come from the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> team. Many of them will see the inside of the office for the first time when they come to work on inauguration day. `` It's a matter of sensitivity,'' <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> says. `` Nobody wants to have the new person watching over their shoulder.'' Many of the people leaving spent the weekend packing their own belongings. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, too, was seen by <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> last week putting some things into a box. `` The president and first lady have been packing for some time,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. `` They have shipped most of their private goods to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> already.'''

<HEAD>Soviets, Chinese Make US Wheat Purchase</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Private exporters have new orders for 530,000 metric tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and 200,000 metric tons from the Chinese under the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> program that lets them buy grain at cut-rate prices. The wheat sold to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> by private exporters was part of 2 million tons authorized Dec. 23 under the department's Export Enhancement Program, or <ORGANIZATION> EEP </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Melvin </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sims </PERSON>, general sales manager for the department's <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, said Tuesday. The wheat was bought under a long-term supply agreement with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, now in its sixth year. <PERSON> Sims </PERSON> said the wheat is for shipment in January, February and March. Counting some wheat left over from previous EEP arrangements, the Soviets have 670,200 tons still available under the program. The Chinese, however, have used almost all of their current subsidy authorization. In the past, each country has had new authorizations set by <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> after exhausting what was available. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> bought more than 9 million tons of wheat under <ORGANIZATION> EEP </ORGANIZATION> arrangements during the fifth year of the grain agreement. The pact expired last Sept. 30 but was later extended through Dec. 31, 1990. The <ORGANIZATION> EEP </ORGANIZATION> arrangement allows exporters to sell wheat and other designated commodities to specified countries at reduced prices in order to meet foreign competition. The exporters then collect free government surpluses of grain or other products as bonuses, or subsidies. Last year, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corn sales to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> totaled slightly less than 5.2 million tons. Wheat sales in 1987-88, all subsidized, totaled slightly more than 9 million tons. A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 39.4 bushels of corn or 36.7 bushels of wheat or soybeans. The 530,000 tons of wheat would be about 19.5 million bushels. Wheat prices at the farm have been averaging more than $ 4 per bushel, according to recent <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> market figures, making the new sale worth an estimated $ 78 million. Besides the wheat for 1988-89 delivery under the pact, the Soviets have ordered 10.2 million tons of corn, 450,000 tons of soybeans, and 1,132,500 tons of soybean meal, plus 500,000 tons of grain sorghum. Only the wheat is subsidized. <PERSON> Sims </PERSON> said the wheat sales will carry an average subsidy rate of $ 23.35 per ton, or about 64 cents per bushel. He said the bonuses on the 530,000 tons of wheat will be paid to eight companies: <ORGANIZATION> Cargill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, 80,000 tons; <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, 200,000; <ORGANIZATION> Garnac </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, 50,000; <ORGANIZATION> Richco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, 50,000; <ORGANIZATION> Tradigrain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, 50,000; <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, 25,000; <ORGANIZATION> Louis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dreyfus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, 25,000; and <ORGANIZATION> Bunge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, 50,000. In the case of the 200,000 tons sold to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Sims </PERSON> said the wheat was part of 1 million tons authorized Dec. 30 for <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. The wheat sales were handled by two companies: <ORGANIZATION> Cargill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, 115,000 tons, and <ORGANIZATION> Louis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dreyfus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, 85,000 tons. <PERSON> Sims </PERSON> said the wheat was sold for March shipment and will carry an average subsidy rate of $ 22.49 per ton, or about 62 cents per bushel. Only 10,000 tons remain available to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> under the program, he said.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> says that for the first time it will reserve some of its summer jobs for students from 17 historically black universities. Deputy Secretary <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Myers </PERSON> said Tuesday that 563 of the 1989 summer jobs will be held aside as part of the department's effort `` to increase the number of minority students in agriculture, forestry and home economics.'' Last year 17,753 students nationwide worked during the summer months for various <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> agencies, and officials said they expect about that many this year. The 563 jobs reserved for the black schools would represent about 3 percent of the total. `` Agriculture is more than crop and livestock production,'' <PERSON> Myers </PERSON> said. `` Animal and plant sciences, economics, forestry, marketing and computer technology are just some of the varied career fields in agriculture today.'' <PERSON> Myers </PERSON> said the jobs will be with 19 <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> agencies and will be located nationwide. He said interested students at 17 institutions should contact university placement offices before March 1. The universities, collectively known as 1890 institutions because of land-grant legislation that year, are being targeted in other ways by <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Myers </PERSON> said. On Dec. 29, the department announced it is establishing offices at each of the 17 schools to help encourage more minorities in agriculture. Also, on Jan. 9, the proposed <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> budget for next year included $ 80.2 million for new and expanded programs to increase the teaching, recruitment and research capabilities at the 1890 schools, a 20 percent increase from the current level. The 17 schools are: <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> A & amp; M, <LOCATION> Huntsville </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Alcorn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Lorman </LOCATION>, Miss. <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arkansas </ORGANIZATION>, Pine Bluff. <ORGANIZATION> Delaware </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Dover </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> A & amp; M <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Tallahassee </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Fort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Kentucky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Frankfort </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Langston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Langston </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Okla. </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Jefferson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maryland-Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shore </ORGANIZATION>, Princess <PERSON> Anne </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> A </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> T </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Greensboro </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Moiseyev </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION>, visiting <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> for the eighth time since 1958, proves it can still surprise. Dancing briskly with their knees bent in an impossible squat, vaulting high in the air, these Soviet dancers are astonishingly athletic and virtuosic, and they look like they're really having fun. The audience picks up on that and has fun, too. The company opened at <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Music </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hall </ORGANIZATION> for 14 performances on Tuesday. They look splendid on that tall, wide stage. There are old favorites on the bill, but <PERSON> Igor </PERSON> <PERSON> Moiseyev </PERSON>, 83, who founded the company in 1937, has choreographed some new things as well. This is good for viewers who've seen the company before. `` Partisans,'' in which dancers in long cloaks glide as though on rollers, then break into horse-like gaits, will always look remarkable, no matter how often seen. A new one on this tour is `` <PERSON> Aragonnaise </PERSON> <PERSON> Jota </PERSON>,'' based on Spanish dance. It's brief and beautiful, the men in white and black, the women in white blouses, red skirts and black lace aprons. Another new one to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is `` Malamba,'' which <PERSON> Moiseyev </PERSON> built using Argentine dances. Also on Tuesday's program was `` Polovtsian Dances,'' from 1974, set to <PERSON> Borodin </PERSON> music known here primarily from `` Kismet.'' The Khan reviews his warriors and captive women. The women are in harem dress and <PERSON> Moiseyev </PERSON> has managed to make their dancing exotic and not at all sexy. It's a long dance with a string of solos and small dances for various ensembles. It would be too lavish for a classical ballet but in this gravity-defying style it seemed an admirable production number. Farcical timing is all in `` Sanchakou,'' in which two Chinese men have a swordfight in the dark. At the beginning, when one puts out his candle, the spotlight gets smaller. It gives the illusion they're in the dark but lets the audience see every near slice. The tour began last week in <LOCATION> Stamford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, and went to <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> before coming to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. From Jan. 31 through March 20, the <PERSON> Moiseyev </PERSON> will perform in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Clearwater </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cupertino </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> is creeping up on the all-time streak of weekly victories in the <ORGANIZATION> A.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nielsen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> ratings after racking up its 30th in a row. And on Sunday, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> should have the highest-rated show of the season, the Super Bowl, and seemingly clear sailing after that. It already has won all 17 weeks of the official television season. Of course, <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> figure the season has an asterisk since they got started late because of the writers strike. The last time a network won an entire season was CBS in 1963-64. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> came within a week of that 39-week record last season, but the World Series on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> broke it. Thanks to a football playoff, <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> flirted with first place two weeks ago, but <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> managed to eke it out. Things were back to relative normal last week. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> won the week with an average prime-time rating of 16.1. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> was second with 13.0 and <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> had 12.6. That was close to the season-to-date average _ <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> has a 15.8, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> 13.0 and CBS 12.2. Each rating point represents 904,000 homes with televisions. The `` CBS Evening News'' won the news race with a 12.1. `` ABC World News Tonight'' had 11.4; `` NBC Nightly News'' 10.9. Several prime-time <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> shows last week recorded their highest ratings this season: `` Cheers,'' `` A Different World,'' `` Midnight Caller'' and `` In the Heat of the Night.'' The week's top-rated show was <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` The Cosby Show,'' whose 29.8 rating was its highest of the season, except for an earlier special one-hour episode. The rest of the top 10 were: `` A Different World,'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>; `` Cheers,'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>; `` Roseanne,'' <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>; `` Who's the Boss?'' <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>; `` The Golden Girls,'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>; `` Murder, She Wrote,'' CBS; `` 60 Minutes,'' CBS; `` <LOCATION> L.A. </LOCATION> Law,'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>; and `` Dear <PERSON> John </PERSON>,'' <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>. The lowest-rated shows were: `` Mission Impossible,'' `` Incredible Sunday,'' `` Tattinger's,'' `` A Fine Mess,'' `` West 57th,'' `` HeartBeat,'' `` Knightwatch,'' `` TV 101'' and `` <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>'s Law.''

 A wheat supply crunch in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> is helping the 12-nation <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> export surplus grain at record levels and fat prices, according to <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> analysts. The department's <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday that `` limited southern hemisphere exportable supplies'' of wheat, coupled with a tight inventory in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, is behind the surge in EEC exports. According to the agency's report, the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> will export a record 19 million metric tons of wheat in the international trading year that runs through June, up from 15.3 million tons in 1987-88. Meanwhile, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat exports were projected at 40.9 million tons, down from 43.4 million tons in 1987-88. <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s exports were shown at 11.7 million tons, down from 23.6 million last year. <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> also showed declines. A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 36.7 bushels of wheat. It said the 1989 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> winter wheat crop, for harvest this coming summer, `` will be the first new-crop supplies available for export and, given the nature of the world wheat market, the size and quality of this crop will likely set the stage for prices in 1989-90.'' The <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> reported last week that American farmers had boosted plantings of winter wheat for this year's harvest by 12 percent. However, much of the newly planted crop is in need of moisture. `` Wheat prices continue to strengthen and have reached their highest level since January 1982 amid a flurry of recent purchases and early concerns about the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> wheat crop,'' the report said. The global wheat stockpile by this summer is expected to shrink to 115.3 million tons from 145.6 million tons a year ago, the report said. Foreign supplies were projected at 100.8 million tons, compared with 14.5 million tons in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Last summer the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> share of the wheat inventory was 34.3 million tons and the remainder of the world, 111.3 million tons.

<TEXT>
 Once again Democrats are out in the cold on Inauguration Day, spectators as a <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> takes office as president. But like <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the Democrats are developing a special fondness for <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Buren </PERSON>. In his first news conference as president-elect, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> expressed his gratitude to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and then said, `` I also want to thank <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Buren </PERSON> for paving the way. It's been a long time, <PERSON> Marty </PERSON>.'' Not since <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Buren </PERSON>'s election in 1836 had an incumbent vice president succeeded in winning the White House. But the Democrats like the second half of the <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Buren </PERSON> story: he was a one-term president, defeated when he ran for re-election in 1840. As usual, there is a bumper crop of politicians hoping to be the star at a Democratic celebration next Inauguration Day. Start with familiar names from the 1988 campaign _ <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>. All are regarded as likely contenders when the 1992 campaign gets rolling. Sens. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> refused to run in 1988, but may not be so reticent the next time around. The same goes for Gov. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>. Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> is a name sure to come up in connection with 1992. And would the early stages of presidential speculation be complete without mention of Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>? What about a woman? Rep. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Schroeder </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> was tempted to join the 1988 field, but decided against it. She has a book coming out in February and plans to do a lot of traveling to promote it. Long shots? The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> is filled with them. Sen. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> was no sooner elected majority leader than whispers began suggesting he'd be an impressive presidential candidate. Newly elected Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerrey </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> also was being mentioned even before moving to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The same was true of Sen. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Robb </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. And somewhere out there in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is a senator, congressman, governor or businessman whose name will come up a year or two from now, touted as the candidate who could break the Republican hold on the White House. Trips to <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, site of the first Democratic presidential caucuses, are a good sign of whether a politician has White House fever. Former professional basketball star <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> made a guest appearance early this year at a college basketball tournament in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>. It's a good bet that Democratic legislative candidates in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> will have all the big-name help they want in the 1990 campaign. Several of the most prominent prospects for 1992 have re-election campaigns in 1990. They include <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>, <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON>, <PERSON> Clinton </PERSON>, <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> and <PERSON> Schroeder </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the defeated 1988 presidential nominee, recently announced he would not seek another term as governor of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> in 1990, a decision he said `` has nothing to do with national office.'' But, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> also said one of the lessons he had learned in 1988 was that `` it is very difficult to run for the presidency as an incumbent governor.'' <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> impressed many voters with his performance as the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential nominee and that seems likely to merit him mention for 1992. But <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> will turn 71 on Feb. 11, 1992.

 <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON>, the ninth president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, pledged in his inaugural address not to run for a second term. He died a month later from pneumonia probably contracted while delivering that address on a bitterly cold day. <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON>'s speech was notable not only for its no-repeat promise, but also because it was the longest on record. It is not remembered for its rhetoric, which included this sentence: `` The spirit of liberty is the sovereign balm for every injury which our institutions may receive.'' Most presidents, however, have reserved their finest phrase-making for their inauguration speech. <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> exhorted his countrymen, when he was sworn for the second term, to act `` with malice toward none; with charity for all.'' <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON> told Depression-plagued Americans that `` the only thing we have to fear is fear itself.'' <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> proclaimed: `` I say to all men, what we have achieved in liberty, we will surpass in greater liberty.'' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON>, the most gifted writer of all 40 presidents, enunciated a basic tenet of democracy: `` absolute acquiescence in the will of the majority.'' The tradition of invoking a higher power dates back to <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON>, who added `` so help me God'' to his oath and kissed the Bible. In the day of the father of our country the inaugural ceremony was indoors. It was moved outside in 1817 by <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON>. The best remembered inaugural speech, for its eloquence, is <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s in 1961. `` Let the word go forth from this time and place, to friend and foe alike, that the torch has been passed to a new generation of <LOCATION> Americans </LOCATION> _ born in this century, tempered by war, disciplined by a hard and bitter peace, proud of our ancient heritage,'' he said. `` Let every nation know, whether it wishes us well or ill, that we shall pay any price, bear any burden, meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose any foe to assure the survival and the success of liberty.'' And, `` ask not what <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> will do for you _ ask what you can do for your country.'' His successor, <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, said in his 1965 inaugural address that <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s heritage must be relearned in each generation. `` If we fail now, then we will have forgotten in abundance what we learned in hardship; that democracy rests on faith, that freedom asks more than it gives, and the judgment of God is harshest on those who are most favored.'' <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> said in 1969 that `` what has to be done, has to be done by government and people together or it will not be done at all. The lesson of past agony is that without the people we can do nothing _ with the people we can do everything.'' <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>, never elected, had no opportunity to deliver an inaugural address. But he was at his most eloquent at his swearing-in after <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> resigned: `` Our long national nightmare is over. Our Constitution works; our great republic is a government of laws and not men. Here the people rule.'' In his turn, in 1977, <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> began his tenure with praise for <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>. `` For myself and for our nation, I want to thank my predecessor for all he has done to heal our land,'' <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said. He told his fellow citizens that `` the bold and brilliant dream which excited the founders of this nation still awaits its consummation. I have no new dream to set forth today, but rather urge a fresh faith in the old dream.'' <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> launched his eight years in the White House with a refrain from his campaign: `` Government is not the solution to our problem; government is the problem.'' And, `` It is not my intention to do away with government. It is rather to make it work _ work with us, not over us; to stand by our side, not ride on our back.''

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Traffic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> says it will investigate reports of fires in the engine compartments of 1985 and 1986 <LOCATION> Pontiac </LOCATION> Fiero cars. The preliminary evaluation, the lowest level of investigation by the safety agency, follows the recall in 1987 of 125,000 Fieros from the 1984 model year after similar fire reports. The latest investigation involves about 147,000 Fieros and was ordered after the agency received 16 unconfirmed complaints of fires. One of the complaints said the fire resulted in an injury, <ORGANIZATION> NHTSA </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday. <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which makes the Fiero, said it was reviewing the allegations in preparing its response to <ORGANIZATION> NHTSA </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said, as is usual in such cases, that the opening of an inquiry does n't necessarily mean there is a defect. <ORGANIZATION> NHTSA </ORGANIZATION> also opened six other low-level investigations into safety allegations involving cars, vans and light trucks made by major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> manufacturers. The preliminary evaluations focused on unconfirmed reports of: _ Steering-linkage lockup causing a loss of control in 35,000 1988 <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chevrolet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Blazer </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> K5 vehicles <ORGANIZATION> NHTSA </ORGANIZATION> reported five complaints with one accident reported. _ Electronic air-suspension failure involving 60,000 1988-1989 <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> The agency had received three complaints, including one involving an accident with injury. _ Fires under the bodies of 1986-1988 <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> F150 and F350 pickup trucks having the F1 fuel-injected engine The agency had received three complaints. _ Cutting and fraying of the right-hand front seatbelt in 450,000 1986-1988 Ford Aerostars Two complaints were received. _ Antifreeze fires under the hoods of 1,000 1983-1987 <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> F350 trucks converted to ambulances <ORGANIZATION> NHTSA </ORGANIZATION> received five complaints. _ Electrical shorts in the tail-light wiring harness of 416,000 1987 <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dodge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Omni </ORGANIZATION> cars Three complaints were reported by <ORGANIZATION> NHTSA </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> NHTSA </ORGANIZATION> raised to an engineering analysis, a higher level of investigation, its study of unconfirmed reports of brake-light failure in 1985 BMW cars. The agency also ended three preliminary evaluations into major manufacturers' vehicles and concluded in each case there was `` no defect trend.'' The investigations closed were into unsubstantiated reports of: _ Heater-core rupture in 1987 VW Golf vehicles _ Floor-mat interference with the gas pedal on 1987-1988 Ford Thunderbird and Mercury Cougar cars _ Rear-hub failure in 1986-1987 <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pontiac </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fieros </ORGANIZATION>

<HEAD>Court Lets Gerrymandering Stand in California, Rejects Bundy Appeal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling over a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> redistricting plan shows the court may be unwilling to restrain state legislatures from high-tech gerrymandering that gives one political party a big edge when drawing congressional district lines. The high court's ruling comes at a time when state legislatures are anticipating redrawing congressional district lines once the 1990 census is completed. The justices, by a vote of 6-3, ruled Tuesday the constitutional rights of Republicans were not violated by a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> redistricting plan that gave Democrats solid control of the state's congressional delegation The court upheld the plan in a one-sentence ruling, sustaining a lower court decision that Republicans did not suffer unlawful discrimination. Republicans said the Democratic-controlled <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION>, using new computer technology, unlawfully manipulated district boundaries. The ruling drew quick reaction from national political leaders, including outgoing <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Fahrenkopf </PERSON> and his successor, <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>. `` Our immediate goal will be to increase Republican representation and control in 1990 in statehouses so that the redistricting process following the next census will be in the hands of responsible elected officials, conscious of their constitutional responsibilities,'' a joint statement said. Rep. <PERSON> Beryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ark </LOCATION>., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Campaign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, welcomed the ruling `` The decision vindicates our judgment that the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> redistricting plan was lawful and fair to the voters of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> was trying to win in court what it could not win with the voters.'' In other matters Tuesday, the court: _ Rejected multiple murderer <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON>'s challenge to his death sentence for killing a 12-year-old girl in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> The man linked to as many as 36 sex slayings or disappearances of young women faces execution Tuesday. _ Turned down the appeals of four <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> death row inmates, including a man linked to the sex slayings of four boys in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> _ Let stand a ruling in a case from <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> that allows anti-smoking groups to see and publicize a cigarette company's research the groups say could link smoking to health _ Rejected a challenge to a <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> law exempting religiously affiliated child-care centers from some health and safety regulations all other child-care centers must meet _ Agreed to decide whether people who intervene in civil rights cases _ and are not the principal defendants _ may be forced to pay the lawyer fees incurred by those who successfully sue The case stems from a sex bias lawsuit against <ORGANIZATION> Trans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. _ Heard arguments in a free-speech challenge to a <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> law that cracks down on child pornography The justices are to announce a decision by July. In the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> redistricting case, Chief Justice <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON> and Justices <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> and <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> voted to grant full review to the dispute. Four votes are needed to grant such review. The other six justices joined in upholding the lower court ruling sustaining the redistricting plan. Their one-sentence decision said simply that `` the judgment is affirmed.'' The court said in 1986 in an <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> legislative reapportionment case that gerrymandering _ the manipulation of voting district boundaries for partisan gain _ may be unlawful even when it results in districts meeting the `` one-person, one-vote'' requirement that districts be equally populated. The justices have held that only if there is evidence of racial bias may a district plan be overturned even when the balanced population test is met. But in splintered voting, the justices upheld the <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> plan that was attacked as a violation of Democrats' rights. The 1986 decision left key questions unanswered, and only four justices joined in the court's main opinion, written by Justice <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>. <PERSON> White </PERSON> said gerrymandering might be unconstitutional if it `` will consistently degrade a voter's or a group of voters' influence on the political processes as a whole.'' <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Republicans said that is exactly what has happened to them. `` The essence of representative democracy is undermined'' when `` a computer-generated gerrymander can preordain what the congressional results will be throughout the decade,'' they said in seeking <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> reconsideration. A three-judge federal court, by a 2-1 vote last April, upheld <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s plan. The federal court said Republicans failed to show that the plan deprived them of political power and fair representation. `` There are no allegations that <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Republicans have been shut out of the political process, nor are there allegations that anyone has ever interfered with <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> registration, organizing, voting, fund-raising or campaigning,'' said Judge <PERSON> Cecil </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Poole </PERSON> for the federal court. <PERSON> Poole </PERSON>, noting that <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> has a <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> governor, a Republican <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> senator and 18 <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members, said there is no evidence the party is `` bereft of the ability to exercise potent power in the political process as a whole.'' Republicans said the Democratic-controlled state <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> rigged district lines to allow Democrats to win 27 of the 45 House seats from <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> even though <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> candidates overall received roughly half the votes cast in recent elections.

 An environmental group says it is applying one of <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s favorite slogans to <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s claim to care about fighting pollution: `` Trust but Verify.'' <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, political director of Friends of the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>, said Tuesday the slogan applies because <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spearheaded the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's drive to relax many government regulations early in its tenure. `` We're willing to take him at his word right now when he says he's an environmentalist, but we're keeping him on a short leash,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. `` Trust but Verify'' is slogan <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has often quoted about arms control negotiations with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s was one of several advocacy groups represented at a news conference held by consumer activist <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Nader </PERSON> to promote their highly critical view of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> years. The groups summed up their longstanding differences with the administration's regulation of food, drugs, the environment, pesticides, auto safety and energy. The <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> was `` in bed with the polluters'' in the early years of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. Although that stopped with a change in agency leadership, <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> has removed only 18 sites from the list of 1,175 scheduled for priority handling under the `` Superfund'' toxic waste cleanup program and has completed work at only 45 more, said <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>. <PERSON> Nader </PERSON> said he called the news conference to offset what <PERSON> Nader </PERSON> called an `` orchestrated media cloud nine'' that he blamed in part on `` the abdication of the role of loyal opposition by the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, none of whose leaders have made any attempt to reflect publicly on the record of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> government.'' Among the criticisms: _ The administration's opposition to and delay of air bags in cars cost 40,000 lives and 1 million injuries, said <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Claybrook </PERSON>, head of Public Citizen, the umbrella advocacy organization founded by <PERSON> Nader </PERSON> Ms. <PERSON> Claybrook </PERSON> was head of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Traffic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> in President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>'s administration. _ Relaxed oversight of drugs and medical devices cost thousands of lives, said Dr. <PERSON> Sidney </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolfe </PERSON>, director of <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citizen </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> Delay of warnings on aspirin about <PERSON> Reye </PERSON>'s syndrome cost 1,000 lives, he said. `` The worst of my fears have come to pass,'' <PERSON> Wolfe </PERSON> said. _ The <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> plans to relax pesticide residue standards on foods and has adopted a farmworker protection policy `` that protects employers,'' said <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Feldman </PERSON>, coordinator of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Campaign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Against </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Misuse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pesticides </ORGANIZATION> _ The administration failed to pursue conservation, overemphasized nuclear power and rolled back auto efficiency standards, complained <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Bossong </PERSON>, director of <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citizen </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Critical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mass </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Project </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Clarence </PERSON> <PERSON> Ditlow </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION>, a group founded with <PERSON> Nader </PERSON>'s help _ Under orders from the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> `` fought hard to keep cancer-causing food additives on the market, has substituted politics and rigid ideology for reasoned scientific decision-making'' and has starved its food regulatory program so much that even the industry pleaded for bigger budgets, said <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Silverglade </PERSON>, legal director of the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> in the Public Interest

 Some of the biggest names in show business are rehearsing for a glittering, nationally televised inaugural gala Thursday night that will boast <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> as special guests in the black-tie audience of 12,000 people. Inaugural officials say the two-hour show may attract a prime-time TV audience of 40 million to 60 million viewers. Ticket sales and proceeds from TV commercials may gross about $ 9 million, making the gala the biggest moneymaker in four days of privately financed inaugural festivities. Rehearsals began at midday Tuesday in the cavernous <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> when a <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Cronkite </PERSON> stand-in introduced Broadway and TV star <PERSON> Nell </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, who danced and belted out the opening number, <PERSON> Fats </PERSON> <PERSON> Waller </PERSON>'s `` The Joint is Jumpin,'' with a frenetic chorus line wearing sweatsuits. Miss <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said she voted for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in the November election. `` I think he's an honorable man,'' she said. `` I think he should be given a chance.'' Other gala headliners will include singers <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinatra </PERSON>, <PERSON> Anita </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> and <PERSON> Julio </PERSON> <PERSON> Iglesias </PERSON>; ballet dancers <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaffe </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Baryshnikov </PERSON>, actor and muscleman <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwarzenegger </PERSON>, child fiddlers from <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, Broadway hoofer <PERSON> Tommy </PERSON> <PERSON> Tune </PERSON>, cellist <PERSON> Yo </PERSON> <PERSON> Yo </PERSON> <PERSON> Ma </PERSON>, actor <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Norris </PERSON>, opera singer <PERSON> Roberta </PERSON> <PERSON> Peters </PERSON>, Gen. <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeager </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Glee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> and the Mormon Tabernacle Choir. The 13 acts will include two of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s country and Western favorites, <PERSON> Loretta </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> Oak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ridge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boys </ORGANIZATION>, along with <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Travis </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Crystal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gayle </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Cissy </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> and <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>. Producer <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Mischer </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> said the cast of more than 1,100 performers will represent a `` cross-section of American entertainment'' and will include `` some surprises'' which he refused to disclose. However, a stack of oversized cue cards for comedian <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Hope </PERSON> was spotted behind a TV camera in the rear of the hall. All 90 of the eight-seat `` boxes'' at the gala _ actually stack chairs surrounded by flimsy blue partitions on the floor facing the stage _ were sold for $ 25,000 each, for a total of $ 2.25 million. Other seats were ticketed at $ 150 to $ 250, depending on location. The president-elect, his family and guests will sit in a large, elevated box facing the front of the stage, which will be surrounded by seats. A smaller box for Vice President-elect <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> and his guests will be situated to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s left. Inaugural officials say 14 minutes of TV commercial time already have been sold for $ 4.9 million. Proceeds from invitation-only ticket sales could boost gross revenues to about $ 9 million. With big-name performers donating their time for free, the gala could yield about $ 6 million after expenses to help defray inaugural costs.

 President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> should set tough civil rights enforcement as a major goal of his administration, a 17-member panel of former federal officials says. `` There is a major rebuilding job to be done to reconstruct the machinery of enforcing civil rights,'' <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> attorney <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said at a news conference called by the <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION>. The private group released a 37-page report titled `` One Nation, Indivisible: The Civil Rights Challenge for the 1990s,'' which offered evidence of a falloff in civil rights enforcement in the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> era. It said the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has filed 31 cases to challenge discriminatory voting practices since 1981. Panel members called that a sharp drop from the record of earlier administrations. The report also said enforcement of equal employment rules applying to federal contractors declined from 269 cases in 1980 to 22 cases in 1986. The <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> estimates that 2 million cases of housing bias occur each year, but an average of 10 housing discrimination cases have been filed annually, the report said. <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said that number represented about half the level under the administrations of former presidents <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> and <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Weaver </PERSON> criticized the notion that there has been a slowdown. He cited a victory in a key housing bias case in <LOCATION> Yonkers </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, as well as a major voting rights case pending against <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> and a lawsuit filed two months ago to bar alleged hiring discrimination by <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>'s police hiring system. `` We've taken heat for these things but we've continued to enforce the laws strenuously,'' he said. He said he could not readily verify that the eight-year total of voting rights cases was 31. But he did say that because court actions under previous administrations remain in place `` the number by definition gets smaller.'' As for cases involving federal contractors, he said, the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has no authority to initiate suits and merely acts on matters referred to it by the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Flemming </PERSON>, chairman of the commission, said the group was sending its report to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` in the hope that he can turn around the'80s as far as civil rights enforcement is concerned.''

<HEAD>Soft-Pedaling Increases Won't Fool Public, Bush Adviser Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FRAM</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The public is likely to view higher levies on gasoline, alcohol and tobacco as tax increases, even if politicians try to soft-pedal them by calling them `` user fees,'' President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s incoming budget director says. The comments by <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> shed light on the thinking of the new administration and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who campaigned on a pledge of no new taxes. Lawmakers and others in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> have been closely watching the words of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and his aides to see if the vice president backs off his campaign promise. <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> submitted written answers to questions posed by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, which holds confirmation hearings Thursday on his appointment. The questionnaire and responses were obtained Tuesday from a source who asked to not be identified. <PERSON> Darman </PERSON>, who has been tapped as <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s chief of the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION>, said that `` depending on the application of funds,'' taxes on gasoline, tobacco and alcohol might be called user fees. But he added, `` the public, however, tends to see these rather unequivocally as taxes.'' He said fees for government services are not a tax `` as long as the government is directly charging the beneficiary only for the cost of the service provided by the government.'' He also said eliminating the deduction for interest on certain types of borrowing and taxing employer-provided fringe benefits could be considered `` definitional changes.'' `` One could engage in long discussions of when one or another revenue measure is or is not a tax,'' <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> wrote. `` Putting academics and sophistry aside, however, my suspicion is that in the end such definitional matters are political: applying the old if-it-looks-like-a-duck rule, if it looks like a tax to most Americans, it's a tax.'' Many congressional Democrats have said they do not understand how the fiscal 1990 deficit can be reduced to $ 100 billion, as required by the Gramm-Rudman balanced budget law, without new taxes. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Sasser </PERSON>, D-Tenn., asked Tuesday about <PERSON> Darman </PERSON>'s comments on taxes, said President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was never tagged as a taxer, even though he signed 11 tax increases into law `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> may find he wants to try to follow in that tradition, but one thing should be clear: We in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> stand ready to work with the administration to deal with these massive deficits, regardless of semantics, and we look forward to a budget proposal from <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>,'' he said in a written statement. <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Panetta </PERSON>, D-Calif., also discussed budget matters Tuesday, indicating that the $ 13 billion in new revenues contained in the spending plan <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> submitted last week might be a good starting point for negotiations between the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> `` If the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> number is used, which is $ 13 billion, then obviously that gives us the opportunity to look not only at those that were suggested by the administration, but other areas as well in order to meet that number,'' <PERSON> Panetta </PERSON> told members of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Panetta </PERSON> said the revenue raisers proposed by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, along with excise taxes on items such as energy, `` are worthy of consideration.'' In his budget, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> proposed raising new money by selling federal assets, imposing or increasing user fees, repealing a reduction in aviation taxes, and other measures.

<HEAD>Loophole Open for $39 Million in House Campaign Funds</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LARRY MARGASAK</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A select group of 190 <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members stockpiled $ 39.2 million in campaign money that can be converted to their personal use under a loophole in election laws, a non-profit group says. Public Citizen's <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Watch </ORGANIZATION> noted Tuesday that the select group is covered by a special provision in federal law permitting those who were serving in the House on Jan. 8, 1980, to keep any remaining campaign funds. The report also said the members of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> elected to the new <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> have built combined campaign war chests of $ 67 million. Public Citizen is a research, lobbying and litigation group founded by consumer advocate <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Nader </PERSON> in 1971. Its report blamed the surplus campaign chests for the 98 percent success rate among <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> incumbents running in 1988 and 1986, adding, `` There is a greater turnover in the Supreme Soviet than in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> House of Representatives.'' `` This certainly discourages qualified candidates from challenging the financially stronger representatives and further ensures the ` incumbent lock' on the House.'' The report covered the period from Jan. 1, 1987, through Nov. 28, 1988. The $ 67 million in surplus money averages $ 154,000 per member, up 39 percent from the 1985-86 balance of $ 48.4 million _ an average of $ 111,332. The $ 39.2 million stockpiled by 189 current members and the late Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON>, D-Ala., for possible personal use is a 34 percent increase from the amount on hand in January 1987 Those who can take advantage of the loophole can watch their money grow `` until they retire,'' the report said. The money `` can be transferred to other political races, donated to their favorite charities -LRB- while writing off the tax deduction -RRB-, used to buy a new car or pay for that needed vacation,'' according to the report. The report said Reps. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Dreier </PERSON>, R-Calif., <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Solarz </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ill </LOCATION>., each have more than $ 1 million stockpiled, with <PERSON> Solarz </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON> permitted to convert the money to personal After surveying how former <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members used the money, the report said that Rep. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Biaggi </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, spent $ 386,064 in leftover campaign funds on legal expenses related to his criminal convictions. He was found guilty of accepting an illegal gratuity and obstruction of justice in accepting a paid <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> vacation from a former <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> Democratic leader; and of racketeering and accepting bribes from <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in exchange for his <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> influence. The late Rep. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.J. </LOCATION>, left $ 310,000 to his wife, and the late Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON>, R-Tenn., left more than $ 600,000 to his family, the report said

<HEAD>Suicides, Other Unnatural Deaths On The Rise</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIJING (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Suicides and other unnatural deaths have increased by 50 percent during the 1980s, the official <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said today. A survey of 10 million people in 25 locales found that the death rate from unnatural causes increased from 31 per 100,000 people in 1981 to 47 in 1987. Four-fifths of the deaths came by suicide, drowning, poisoning and traffic accidents, <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> said. The report did not say if murder was included in the statistics. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> gives no statistics on suicide, but <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> said that in the countryside, where most Chinese live, one-third of unnatural deaths were by suicide. More women than men took their own lives, it said. The survey found that family disputes, marital problems and poor personal relations led to half the suicides. About 20 percent of suicides were terminally ill patients. The report said two-thirds of those killing themselves used poison, and called for tighter control over dispensing of poisons. Tens of thousands of Chinese are believed to have killed themselves during the 1966-76 Cultural Revolution when ultra-leftists persecuted huge numbers of people. Today, most suicides are linked to personal problems and difficulties in adjusting to social changes as <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> switches to a more market-oriented, competitive economic system. Last year, the nation's first non-governmental suicide prevention center was established in <LOCATION> Canton </LOCATION>.

 A retired obstetrician used his trade skills and techniques he saw on a television show about a veterinarian to `` deliver'' a 55-pound dog from the 6-foot deep hole it had been digging for months. Dr. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dorman </PERSON>'s next-door neighbor called him Saturday night when she found <PERSON> Dusty </PERSON>, a 10-year-old mutt, was stuck in the hole, with just his wagging tail sticking out. <PERSON> Dorman </PERSON> got a shovel and pickax, but found they were of limited use on the frozen ground. Drawing on his experience delivering breech babies and memories of the TV show `` All Creatures Great and Small,'' <PERSON> Dorman </PERSON> worked his arm into the hole, grabbed the dog's hind legs, stretched them out and tied them with a rope. He then pulled the rope slowly to free the mutt, which was dirty but unharmed. `` This was the first delivery I've had since I stopped practicing seven years ago,'' <PERSON> Dorman </PERSON> said. `` I hope it's my last breech delivery.''

 Should he be hoisted by his own petard, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will begin his presidency with one of the sorest arms in history. About 35,000 little <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> flags will be distributed to spectators at his inaugural Friday. At least 700 larger flags will be carried before him in the hours-long parade to follow. Can the man who espoused the pledge of allegiance to the flag with religious fervor in the last campaign get by with just an occasional salute? With all those flags, just a token movement of the arm toward the heart could leave <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> with the sorest arm since <PERSON> Sandy </PERSON> <PERSON> Koufax </PERSON> quit baseball. The marching band from the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> alone could wear out the new president. Its 320 marchers will carry 30 flags along with 60 trumpets, 40 trombones, 20 baritones, 24 tubas, 26 percussion, 36 clarinet, 30 french horns, 25 saxophones and 24 piccolos. Can a man from <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> stand motionless before all that? The statistics come courtesy of the inaugural committee, which produced a handbook of breathtaking scope. It tells far more than you could possibly want to know about inaugurals in compelling detail. For example: <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and the six presidents before him were all born between 1908 and 1924, a fact the need of which is not yet clear. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will rank with the four tallest presidents in history, behind <PERSON> Abe </PERSON> <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>, <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON>. He also will enter history books as one of four left-handed presidents, the others being <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Garfield </PERSON>, <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>. The dome of the Capitol expands and contracts as much as four inches because of the heat of the sun by day and cooling by night, which is in sharp contrast to most of its tenants who are known to expand frequently and contract seldom. Mrs. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Taft </PERSON> was the first woman to ride in an inaugural parade in 1913. <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Harding </PERSON> was the first president to ride to his swearing-in in a car. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> was the first to review his parade behind bullet-proof glass. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is 31st among college graduates who made it to the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, 12th among Phi Beta Kappa boys, second among <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> men. Married 44 years, <PERSON> George </PERSON> and <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> bring the ninth longest marriage to the White House. <PERSON> John </PERSON> and <PERSON> Abigail </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> were married the longest, 54 years and three days. But <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is the only president born in June. You will also sleep better knowing that <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> was the only vice president visibly drunk at his inaugural, a condition he blamed on alcohol consumed to combat the pain of typhoid fever. Should you need more for your next game of Trivial Pursuit, remember <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON> had the first running water in the White House, from a cistern he put in the roof; <PERSON> Millard </PERSON> <PERSON> Fillmore </PERSON> had the first bathtub installed; <PERSON> Rutherford </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON>, the first telephone; <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> McKinley </PERSON>, the first elevator; <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON>, the first dishwasher. But <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will be the first captain of a <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> baseball team to become president.

<HEAD>Quayle Says He Wants To Make GOP More Inclusive</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RITA BEAMISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> says that as vice president he hopes to help open up the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> to the poor and minorities and turn around its image as `` the party of exclusion.'' The vice president-elect said that after he is sworn in to office on Friday he hopes to spend time quietly visiting the disadvantaged and learning about their problems. `` I'd like to go out and not have a lot of advance publicity on that, just sit down and talk to these people on their turf, in their neighborhood, on their grounds and to hear them out and get a feel and get a sensitivity for issues that are of concern to them,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said in an interview Tuesday with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. The former senator from <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> also endorsed the 50 percent congressional pay raise that President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> backs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has said he supports <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s stance, but that he might take another look at the matter after he becomes president. `` I know it's a lot,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said of the raise for federal judges and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> members. But he said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> `` thought long and hard. I support his decision.'' The pay raise plan will take effect next month unless <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> vetoes or modifies it. On another subject, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> `` is in a much stronger position'' than many <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> skeptics think. `` He's consolidated power much quicker than any other Soviet general secretary,'' said <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, a former member of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said he thinks <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policy of glasnost, or openness, `` is for real,'' but he sees the perestroika policy of economic reform as just a way to consolidate power. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> has met with several reporters in the past few days after refusing interviews for much of the period since the Nov. 8 election. Discussing how he will handle his new job, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said he will not speak out at <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> meetings, but will relay his opinions to President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> privately. The key to his job, he said, is a close personal relationship with the new president. The 41-year-old vice president-elect said he intends to be a `` broad-ranging adviser'' to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who is 64. He said he has been involved in `` all of the discussions for cabinet'' choices and other matters, except the early selection of <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> as secretary of state. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said the assignments <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> gives him will evolve with time and circumstances. They `` will be of substance, stature and of importance to the president.'' `` When you are a broad-ranging adviser to the president, you take on assignments from him that he deems are important, and from time to time he will turn to me and say, ` I need help here.''' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said. He said he meets daily with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and they have discussed a desire to `` reposition the Republican party, and get out of this stereotype, stereocast image of being the party of exclusion rather than the party of inclusion.'' `` It's this image that somehow you do n't care, and it's just not true of me and it's not true of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>,'' he said. `` And unfortunately the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> is still cast in that mold, and we're going to try and turn it around.'' He promised the new administration would `` go to some of the places Republicans have n't gone before.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> has decided he wo n't spend as much time as he originally envisioned working as an administration advocate on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, where the Constitution gives him the job of <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> president. That is both because he wo n't have enough time, he said, and because many of his former colleagues `` want to have the communication up there -LRB- on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> -RRB-, but they also want to have the communication down here,'' at his White House office. Since the election, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said, he does n't sleep soundly the way he once did from 11 p.m. to 5:30 or 6 a.m. `` I have to confess that periodically you wake up during the night and you think about the responsibilities and the challenges that are ahead of you,'' he said. `` And they are responsibilities that I certainly look forward to, but they are certainly much different than just being a senator.''

The government's job is to take care of the majority.'' `` They do n't need to take care of those who can take care of themselves,'' said <PERSON> Stella </PERSON>, known for his minimalist paintings on different shaped canvases. `` We're not charity cases.'' <PERSON> Stella </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lichtenstein </PERSON> agreed that the healthy economy favors artists by spurring purchase of their works as financial investments and additions to private collections. `` The arts are doing very well now,'' said <PERSON> Lichtenstein </PERSON>, who famous for his comic strip technique. `` My guess is that they -LRB- the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration -RRB- will do more for the arts.'' Nevertheless, he said: `` It's not that you just spend money and everything gets better. It's shameful, too, that we have such a wealthy government that supports art so little compared with other Western countries.'' The gallery's recently installed exibition of more than 230 early art works from <ORGANIZATION> Picasso </ORGANIZATION> will remain on view for two years with support by a grant from <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION>.

 The government has ordered the name of one of <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s top lieutenants, party ideologue <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Zhdanov </PERSON>, stripped from universities, factories and cities nationwide. The move Tuesday is the latest in a series of actions taken to wipe out the names of late Kremlin leaders and officials who have fallen into disgrace or disfavor under President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. Last month, Communist authorities ordered the names of two recent Soviet leaders, <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> and <PERSON> Konstantin </PERSON> <PERSON> U. </PERSON> <PERSON> Chernenko </PERSON>, removed from their homes and from every town, school and factory still named for them. Since coming to power in March 1985, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has been increasing critical of past Soviet leaders, calling <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s harsh 29-year rule a deviation from the ideals of Soviet founder <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON> and blaming <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> for economic stagnation and corruption. <PERSON> Zhdanov </PERSON>, first secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Leningrad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> organization in 1934-44, died under mysterious circumstances in 1948. He directed violent purges in the country's second-largest city following the 1934 assassination of <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirov </PERSON>, the former <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> party chief who opposed <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s dictatorial rule. The liquidation of real or imagined opponents of <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> is seen by Western historians as the dawn of the dictator's 1934-38 Great Purge, in which some 10 million Soviets were arrested, banished into internal exile, or killed. The evening TV news program `` Vremya'' said a recommendation from the <ORGANIZATION> Commpunst </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s policy-making <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> to remove <PERSON> Zhdanov </PERSON>'s name from the map was sent to the Supreme Soviet Presidium, the nation's top executive body, and to the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministers </ORGANIZATION> and legislatures in the 15 republics. <PERSON> Zhdanov </PERSON> `` was one of the sponsors of massive repressions of the'30s and'40s against guiltless Soviet people,'' said the announcement on Vremya. `` He is responsible for criminal actions committed at that time and for the violation of socialist law.'' Stripped of <PERSON> Zhdanov </PERSON>'s name were universities in <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION> and in the Siberian city of <LOCATION> Irkutsk </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s engineering academy, and a locomotive works in the Ukrainian city of <LOCATION> Poltava </LOCATION>, it said. A Ukrainian city on the Sea of <LOCATION> Azov </LOCATION>, renamed <PERSON> Zhdanov </PERSON> in 1948, will revert to its former name of Mariupol. The recommendation from the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, considered binding on Soviet government bodies, says <PERSON> Zhdanov </PERSON>'s name should be stricken from `` cities, neighborhoods, streets, enterprises, collective farms, military units and institutions of learning.'' In <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, both a neighborhood and a subway station bear <PERSON> Zhdanov </PERSON>'s name. Under <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>, <PERSON> Zhdanov </PERSON> also served for a time as party secretary for ideological affairs. He introduced strict political control and extreme nationalism into the arts, and opposed Western cultural influences that were denounced as `` cosmopolitanism.'' In 1953, a group of Jewish doctors was accused of murdering <PERSON> Zhdanov </PERSON>, which touched off widespread fears among Soviet Jews that the Kremlin might be laying the groundwork for an official campaign of anti-Semitism by staging a show trial of his purported assassins. The announcement read on `` Vremya'' and later carried by the <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency said <PERSON> Zhdanov </PERSON>'s name was being erased from the Soviet landscape `` in response to the numerous requests of workers.''

<HEAD>Iraq and Syria May Have Germ Weapons, US Expert Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RUTH SINAI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A military affairs expert says there is good reason to believe that <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> possess biological weapons, and <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> officials confirm that <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> is close to creating such an arsenal while <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> is in the research stage. `` There is strong evidence to suggest that <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has biological weapons, possibly including toxins,'' <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Seth </PERSON> <PERSON> Carus </PERSON>, a researcher at the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Institute </LOCATION> for <LOCATION> Near </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Policy </LOCATION>, said Tuesday. <PERSON> Carus </PERSON>, who has been studying the proliferation of chemical and biological warfare in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> for the past several years at the privately funded think tank, said reports from <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> that <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> used biological agents against its Kurdish minority are unreliable. But he added he had been informed by official sources that <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> does have such capability. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> produces the weapons at a facility near the village of <LOCATION> Salman </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pak </LOCATION>, 35 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> reported Tuesday, citing unnamed intelligence sources. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> also has the capacity to make 1,000 tons of chemical agents annually, <PERSON> Carus </PERSON> said. There is documented proof <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> used such weapons as mustard and nerve gas against <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and against the Kurds as recently as 1987. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> manufactures chemical weapons but has never used them, <PERSON> Carus </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> also has a stock of biological arms, but it is not known if it has acquired sophisticated delivery systems such as rockets, <PERSON> Carus </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> may have received help for its program from communist <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, which is known to have a biological warfare program, <PERSON> Carus </PERSON> said. Israeli officials said, however, that <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> had completed research and development on such weapons and was `` on the verge'' of manufacturing them. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> is in the initial stages of research, said the officials, who spoke only on condition they not be named. Toxins, such as snake venoms, are poisons which are not biological agents but can easily be produced by using bacteria cultures. Biological weapons are living organisms that cause lethal diseases such as cholera, anthrax and typhoid. They can be introduced into water systems or simply sprayed into the air. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, which signed but did not ratify the 1972 biological weapons treaty, denies having biological or chemical arms. A <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official declined to say if the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is aware of the Iraqi capability. <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> is believed to have worked on acquiring biological weapons in the 1960s, <PERSON> Carus </PERSON> said. In the early 1970s, the late Egyptian President <PERSON> Anwar </PERSON> <PERSON> Sadat </PERSON> said `` we have the instruments of biological warfare in the refrigerators.'' But <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> did not use the germs in its 1973 war with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> or in any other conflict, <PERSON> Carus </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has the ability to produce biological agents, `` although it may not currently have a biological warfare capability,'' <PERSON> Carus </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has said it intends to acquire such capability, but little is known about that plan, he added.

Pentagon spokeswoman <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bodanyi </PERSON> said the purchases began in early 1988 and so far have involved buying from international arms dealers or private citizens Soviet MiG-15, 17 and 21 jet fighters.

 The television movie `` The Ryan White Story'' got mixed reviews from the players in the real saga the hemophiliac boy who was barred from school after being diagnosed with AIDS. The <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> version, starring <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>, <PERSON> Judith </PERSON> <PERSON> Light </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lukas </PERSON> <PERSON> Haas </PERSON>, was broadcast Monday night on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>. `` If the purpose of the film was to portray <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>, his family and his feelings, then I am sure it was accurate as they saw it,'' said <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Colby </PERSON>, principal of <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Middle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, which barred <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> from attending after he was diagnosed with acquired immune deficiency syndrome in December 1984. `` I thought <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> played a nice <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Vaughan </PERSON> -LRB- <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>'s attorney -RRB- and <PERSON> Lukas </PERSON> <PERSON> Haas </PERSON> reminded me a lot of <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> The film captured the relentless pressure applied to all by the media.''

<TEXT>
 Soviet planes delivered tons of arms and ammunition to the Moscow-backed Afghan government last week and lifted <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> troops out of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> at twice the usual rate, diplomats say. At the current pace, the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s withdrawal could be completed by the end of January, Western diplomats in <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION> said Tuesday. `` However, for political reasons the Russians may wish to keep a military presence in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> up to Feb. 15,'' said one. Under a U.N.-brokered accord, <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> has pledged to remove its remaining troops from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> by that date, although <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>'s ruling Marxists have not reached a settlement with the Moslem insurgents who have battled them for more than a decade The Soviets, who intervened in December 1979, are demanding a role in a post-war government for members of the current regime. But the guerrillas, most of whom are based in bordering <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, reject any power-sharing and, according to a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> official, will convene a meeting of a 500-member council by Feb. 1 in an attempt to form a transitional government. <PERSON> Benon </PERSON> <PERSON> Sevan </PERSON>, who has been shuttling between <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> seeking a political settlement, told a news conference at <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> on Tuesday that the conference's composition is still under discussion The Western diplomats, who spoke on condition they not be identified further, said takeoffs and landings of Soviet IL-76 transport planes at <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> airport numbered about 40 between Jan. 9 and 14, or twice the usual rate. Soviet troops were seen boarding the planes after Afghan troops unloaded tons of military equipment and ammunition. As many as 18 SS-1 `` Scud'' missiles were transported from the airport during the period, according to diplomats and Western journalists. Soviet armor has been digging into new positions north of the <LOCATION> Hindukush </LOCATION> mountains along the snowbound <LOCATION> Salang </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Road </LOCATION>, which runs some 240 miles from <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> north to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, the sources said. The road is a principal evacuation route for <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> troops. The sources said that judging by convoys arriving in <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, Soviet-Afghan forces apparently have been able to keep the route open despite harassment by the insurgents. Diplomats said workers have been busy cutting down trees and leveling earth along the avenue that runs past the Afghan <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Embassy </LOCATION> in southern <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. One source speculated the workers were preparing an emergency airstrip next to the Soviet mission. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> continue to accuse <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> of violating the pullout accord by continuing to arm and supply the rebels, many of whom operate from bases in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>.

 Thirteen-year-old <PERSON> Eddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Melucci </PERSON> knew he had a fatal brain tumor, but insisted on playing one more game with his Little League baseball team before he died. The team won the championship. <PERSON> Eddy </PERSON> died Sunday, a few months later. `` I visited him in the hospital 22 days before our first game, and he told me he was going to play,'' said <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hien </PERSON>, <PERSON> Eddy </PERSON>'s coach and manager of the <ORGANIZATION> Tigers </ORGANIZATION>. `` I half believed him, but he was back at practice the day before our first game, and he had two hits opening day.'' <PERSON> Eddy </PERSON>, who was diagnosed with the tumor last spring, decided to return to the baseball diamond less than a month after an operation. <PERSON> Eddy </PERSON>, normally a third baseman and pitcher, was kept in the outfield until his reaction time returned to normal. He had to wear a 15-pound helmet in the early weeks following March's surgery. `` We were dealing with a really tough kid who could handle anything mentally,'' said <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> Fiore </PERSON>, safety director for the <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Little </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> and designer of the helmet. `` He was a kid who just would n't quit.'' `` He made his own decisions: when to have the operation and to die at home,'' <PERSON> Eddy </PERSON>'s mother, <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Melucci </PERSON>, said Monday. The operation would have left <PERSON> Eddy </PERSON> with five to 15 years to live if successful, said his father, <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Melucci </PERSON>. But <PERSON> Eddy </PERSON> fell ill in Novemeber, and doctor's revised their prognosis to six months.

 A man on parole for two bank robberies tried to flee when police on the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Turnpike </LOCATION> stopped the car he was in, but he was shot to death when he grabbed for an officer's gun, authorities said Police found 5 -LCB- ounces of cocaine on the man, whose name was being withheld until relatives were notified. The driver of the car was arrested during the incident Tuesday, and a second passenger was being sought by state and local police on foot and in helicopters, said state police spokesman Capt. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallagher </PERSON>. State Police Trooper <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Henig </PERSON>, 26, pulled the car over for speeding and told one of the passengers to get out and show some identification, <PERSON> Gallagher </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Henig </PERSON> spotted what he believed to be a bag of marijuana while the man was looking for identification, <PERSON> Gallagher </PERSON> said. The bag later turned out to be cocaine, police said.

 <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> has become one of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s filthiest nations, its city streets a jungle of garbage and graffiti, the government-funded <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> said in a report today. `` <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> is filthy, worse than comparable cities in mainland <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>,'' says the report, which blames the problem on a growing lack of personal discipline. `` The same is true of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> as a whole, as children chuck away sweet -LRB- candy -RRB- wrappers and ice lolly wrappings, and adults calmly wind down car windows and dispatch empty cans as well as squashed paper packets as they speed to their presumably well-kept homes or places of work,'' it says. The author, commission urban affairs specialist <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hillman </PERSON>, said that although the report, entitled `` A New Look for <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>,'' concentrates on the capital, the problems affect all of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. The report describes street gutters filled with empty beverage cans and old newspapers; plastic garbage sacks dumped around lampposts, often spilling their contents on to the sidewalk; and roadsides lined with discarded mattresses, broken chairs, old stoves, abandoned supermarket carts and other trash. Other complaints were of overflowing litter bins; remains of fast-food meals strewn around shopping malls; and dog and pigeon excrement on sidewalks and in public parks. The report also noted graffiti on trains, the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> subway, buses and in `` ill-designed areas of urban residential wilderness and almost any convenient blank stone or painted wall.'' It said people increasingly `` graze'' in and around shopping malls, eating on the move and dropping food and wrappers on the way. Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, in a foreword to the report, wrote of the need for residents of all the country's municipalities to `` involve themselves in the upkeep and improvement of their local streets and centers.'' The report recommends that the banks of the <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Thames </LOCATION> be turned into a national park. Legislation covering officially designated national parks imposes rigorous controls on the collection of garbage and similar matters. In July 1986, government ministers and pop music entrepreneur <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Branson </PERSON> launched a $ 40 million drive using taxpayers' money to clean up <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s streets, countryside and derelict industrial land. But Londoners and foreign visitors say there has been little evidence that the project has had much effect. The <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> was first set up in 1924 to advise government departments on projects and developments affecting national or public amenities.

 Volcanoes killed more people in the'80s than during the previous 78 years, yet the deadly peaks are inadequately monitored to protect 350 million people who live near their slopes, a geologist says. `` We have to do a better job of studying the volcanoes of the world,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Tilling </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Geological Survey geologist who coordinated the agency's response to the <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Helens </LOCATION> eruption. `` Existing methods of monitoring volcanoes are proving relatively reliable. We just do n't do enough of it.'' Since A.D. 1000 more than 300,000 people died from volcanic flows _ lava, pyroclastic or mud _ tsunamis and post-eruption starvation, Tilling said in a summary of his remarks for today's annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. Mudflows from <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s Nevado del Ruiz killed at least 22,000 people in 1985, while more than 2,000 perished in pyroclastic flows _ blasts of hot gas, rock and ash _ from <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chichon </LOCATION> in 1982, Tilling said. Mount St. <PERSON> Helens </PERSON> left 57 people dead or missing. In 1902, pyroclastic flows killed 29,000 near <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pelee </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Martinique </LOCATION>, 6,000 near <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Maria </LOCATION> volcano in <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>, and 1,560 in the eruption of <LOCATION> Soufriere </LOCATION> on <PERSON> St. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON>, said Tilling, who is based in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> His count shows 13,080 more died during the six other deadly eruptions this century: three volcanoes in 1951 and three others in 1911, 1919 and 1963. An average of 50 of Earth's 600 volcanoes erupt each year, most without fatalities, and the rate `` has not changed much in historical times. But because the world population has exploded ... to 5 billion in 1987, the problem posed by volcanic and associated hazards is greater now than ever before,'' he said. He said more than 350 millon people live on or within danger range of volcanoes _ about 14 percent of the population. `` We spend a lot of effort at a few volcanoes _ and we need to,'' Tilling said in an interview. `` But we're not applying existing -LRB- monitoring -RRB- technology to more volcanoes, especially in developing countries where the risks and hazards are the greatest.'' And, he said, the most dangerous volcanoes are the least studied. Part of the problem, Tilling said, is that volcanoes erupt infrequently compared with natural hazards such as earthquakes, major storms, floods and landslides. `` However in populated areas, even very small eruptions can wreak havoc and cause widespread devastation'' such as the Nevado del Ruiz eruption. The mountain blew out only 3 percent as much ash as <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Helens </LOCATION>' May 18, 1980, explosion. But the tiny Colombian eruption melted glacial ice, burying <LOCATION> Armero </LOCATION> and other towns under mudflows, he said. Tilling urged an international effort to reduce volcano deaths. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> previously have endorsed an international scientific effort for the 1990s designated the International Decade for Natural Hazards Reduction. To reduce volcano deaths, scientists must identify high-risk mountains, study their geology to learn how often eruptions occur and whether the eruptions were explosive, map the routes of killer flows to identify danger zones, then install monitoring equipment where necessary to listen for earthquakes, uplift and tilting, and other signs of activity. Asked who should pay the bill for better volcano monitoring, Tilling replied: `` There's the question.'' Tilling said the 10 most deadly eruptions since A.D. 1000 were: _ <LOCATION> Tambora </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>, 1815, 92,000 deaths, including 80,000 from starvation _ Krakatau, <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>, 1883, 36,420 killed by tsunamis, or volcanic tidal waves _ <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pelee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Martinique </LOCATION>, 1902, 29,000 dead _ <PERSON> Nevado </PERSON> <PERSON> del </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruiz </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, 1985, at least 22,000 _ Vesuvius, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, 1631, 18,000 killed _ Unzen, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, 1792, 15,190 tsunami deaths _ Etna, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, 1169, 15,000 fatalities _ Kelut, <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>, 1586, 10,000 killed _ Etna again in 1669, 10,000 more victims _ <LOCATION> Lakagigar </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iceland </LOCATION>, 1783, 9,340 lives lost

 Sikh militants raided a village in northern <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> and shot and killed a Hindu family of four, police said today. About five Sikh gunmen raided the home of Anant Ram in <LOCATION> Bhurhe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gill </LOCATION>, 30 miles south of <LOCATION> Amritsar </LOCATION>, at midnight Tuesday and killed four members of his family, police chief G.S. <PERSON> Mann </PERSON> said. Ram and his two sons were killed inside a room and the assailants shot and killed <PERSON> Vinod </PERSON> <PERSON> Kumar </PERSON>, a relative of Ram, when tried to resist the attack, <PERSON> Mann </PERSON> said. Sikhs, who make up two percent of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s 880 million people, allege they are discriminated against by the Hindus, at 80 percent of the populace the country's religious majority. Sikhs are, however, in majority in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>, a rich farming state bordering <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. Sikh militants have been campaigning since 1982 for an independent homeland in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>. The latest slayings brought the death toll blamed on the militants this year to 120.

<HEAD>Researcher Predicts Availability of Fat that's Safe for the Heart</HEAD>

 Eggs, beef and other tasty dishes considered bad for the heart can be made healthy by replacing the dangerous fats in those foods with safe ones, a top researcher predicts. Almost every sensible eating plan advocated by health groups calls for cutting out fat in order to avoid the saturated fat that contributes to heart disease and to prevent overweight. But while such diets may be healthy, they usually mean skimping on the meat, ice cream, pastries and other tasty things most Americans think are good food. `` For Americans, low-fat diets are not close to reality. They find low-fat diets unpalatable,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Grundy </PERSON>, who described his work Tuesday at a meeting of the American <ORGANIZATION> Heart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Grundy </PERSON>, co-author of past dietary statements by the association and director of the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nutrition </ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, has been searching for safe fats that can take place of the dangerous ones Americans like so much. Typically, sensible eating plans urge people to restrict fat intake to 30 percent of their total daily intake of calories, and suggest that fat consumption be divided roughly equally between the three major kinds: saturated, polunsaturated and monounsaturated. Saturated fat is found in relatively high quantities in meat and foods that contain butter fat or palm oil. The body converts this fat to cholesterol, and it clogs the arteries that supply the heart, leading to heart attacks. <PERSON> Grundy </PERSON> said two imporant substitutes for saturated fat should be monounsaturated fat and stearic acid. Monounsaturated fat is found in olive oil, canola oil and some forms of safflower oil and sunflower seed oil. <PERSON> Grundy </PERSON>'s studies have shown that eating monounsaturates will lower the body's levels of low-density lipoprotein, or LDL, the so-called bad cholesterol that contributes to heart disease. But unlike polyunsaturated fat, it does not lower HDL, the good cholesterol that protects people from heart trouble. Stearic acid is found in meat and other foods. While it is a saturated fat, <PERSON> Grundy </PERSON>'s work has shown that it does not raise cholesterol. He said that it should take the place of palm oil in margarine and shortening. Other research shows that a sterol, or an unsaturated alcohol, produced by plants can be added to eggs, preventing the body from absorbing the cholesterol in egg yolks, <PERSON> Grundy </PERSON> said. Fat substitutes are also being developed that are entirely calorie-free, and meat producers are starting to raise low-fat beef. This does not mean, however, that people will be able to eat fat with abandon, <PERSON> Grundy </PERSON> said. `` Fat contains more calories than carbohydrates,'' he said. `` This could backfire if people see it as a license to eat fat and get fat.'' On the other hand, he said, some people may find it easier to keep their weight down on a higher-fat diet, because this food satisfies their hunger better and thus they eat less. <PERSON> Grundy </PERSON> said the recommendation that fat consumption be held to 30 percent of total calories is still a good general guideline, but that it does n't have to be the rule for everyone. `` Some individuals may prefer higher fat intakes without concern for detrimental effect,'' he said.

 Children whose families escaped the horrors of the Vietnam War saw their schoolyard turned into a killing field, the target of a silent gunman armed with a rifle and a pistol bearing the word `` victory.'' After the massacre at recess, the bodies of three Southeast Asian children were outlined in blue on the playground of <ORGANIZATION> Cleveland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> where they died. Two others had been dragged by teachers inside to a classroom, but also died. Twenty-nine other pupils were wounded, along with a teacher. `` There was shooting all over. ... I was scared,'' said sixth-grader <PERSON> Binh </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoang </PERSON>, who was born in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> in 1975 in the final days of war and had never before heard gunfire. `` Everybody was crying in my class.'' Police said a drifter identified as <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Purdy </PERSON>, 26, armed with two handguns and an AK-47 assault rifle, entered the school grounds around noontime Tuesday and fired about 60 rounds before he shot himself to death. Afterward, a large handgun and the assault rifle lay on the ground near a pool of blood and the gunman's body. The word `` victory'' was written on the pistol handle. <PERSON> Binh </PERSON> said she was sitting in math class when the shooting began outside the wood-and-stucco school building. Her teacher told students to get under their desks. The gunfire startled <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuevas </PERSON>, whose first thought was that the University of the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> fraternities near his house were firing their miniature cannon again. But the shots repeated too rapidly for a cannon, and the scream of sirens that followed told him this time was no prank. `` I never thought a tragedy of this magnitude could happen in <LOCATION> Stockton </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Cuevas </PERSON>, a 29-year-old marine clerk at the Port of <PERSON> Stockton </PERSON> who lives down the street from the elementary school. `` It's always in some other town, some other place. It's a shock to my senses. I do n't think it's even hit me as hard as it's going to. You do n't know whether to be excited, or confused or what.'' Police cars and news reporters crowded the street, which typically is busy only when parents pick up and drop off their children. `` Why here?'' said <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Russell </PERSON>, 37, who was born and reared in the neighborhood. `` This has always been a sleepy little town. -LRB- The shooting -RRB- put us back on the map.'' Lutheran and Baptist churches border the school in a neighborhood of ranch-style homes, postage-stamp lawns and streets lined with sycamore and oak trees in this agricultural city of 150,000 people 60 miles southeast of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. The 40-year-old neighborhood near the University of the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> is still home to many retired couples who raised their familes there. But the city has been changing with the influx of Southeast Asian refugees. When school officials called clergy to console grieving families, <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> priests in sandals and saffron robes arrived along with their white-collared Christian counterparts. About 60 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Cleveland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION>'s students are of Southeast Asian descent, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Klose </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Stockton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION>. The five children who were killed were Vietnamese and Cambodian. `` This is one of our best neighborhood schools,'' <PERSON> Klose </PERSON> said. `` Of all of our schools that I would think of something like this happening, this would be the last one I would think of.'' Across the street, <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> <PERSON> Abbott </PERSON> stood astride her bicycle and gazed at the school where she graduated `` many years ago.'' The professional nanny said she was at the house of her 97-year-old grandfather about a block from the school when the gunman set his car on fire before starting to shoot. `` When the car exploded, my grandpa's house just shook,'' <PERSON> Abbott </PERSON> said. `` It scared me. ... It was just too close.''

 Multimillionaire <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hearin </PERSON> has paid $ 1 million in ransom and spent six anguish-filled months awaiting word on his kidnapped wife, and neighbors say it might be time to accept she'll never return. `` For fear of sounding callous, I do n't want to say that.

New things develop all the time, but nothing at this time looks real promising,'' said <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>. <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> said he could n't discuss the case while it's still being investigated, but said police are hoping something will come of <LOCATION> Hearin </LOCATION>'s Sept. 8 offer of a $ 100,000 reward for information leading to his wife's safe return. <PERSON> Hearin </PERSON>, 70, who may be the wealthiest man in <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, has shunned publicity most of his life, and his name was virtually unknown until his wife, who he met before World War II, was kidnapped. At an Aug. 7 news conference he pleaded for her return, and family members were interviewed on a Nov. 9 segment of the <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> television program `` Unsolved Mysteries,'' which generated about 300 calls that did n't pan out. `` The <PERSON> Hearin </PERSON> family very much appreciates your interest, but they do n't have any comment at this time,'' a spokeswoman said Tuesday when asked if <PERSON> Hearin </PERSON>, his son and daughter plan any new appeals. <PERSON> Hearin </PERSON>, worth an estimated $ 200 million, controls <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>'s largest gas distribution company, <ORGANIZATION> Mississippi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>; its second-largest bank, <ORGANIZATION> Trustmark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>; and its second-largest insurance company, <ORGANIZATION> Lamar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Ironically, the kidnapper's vague note demanded that an unspecified amount of money be given to 12 former franchise owners sued by <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, one of <PERSON> Hearin </PERSON>'s more obscure A letter with an <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> postmark, received Aug. 15, is the only message Mrs. <PERSON> Hearin </PERSON>'s family has received. The letter urged <PERSON> Hearin </PERSON> to comply with the demands. <PERSON> Hearin </PERSON> paid a total of about $ 1 million on Aug. 16 to the 12 people _ most of whom returned the money. But investigators never heard from the kidnapper again. Neighbors say there was a time when publicity was welcome ammunition in the fight to find their friend. But there comes a time when the memory of the well-liked society matron should be left in peace _ and they say perhaps that time is here. `` I do n't think _ the neighbors do n't think _ there's much hope after all this time of finding her alive. She's a very frail person,'' said one neighbor, who has known Mrs. <PERSON> Hearin </PERSON> `` for about at least 30 or 40 years.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Hearin </PERSON> suffers from ileitis, a chronic inflammation of the small intestines, which could be fatal if she does n't receive daily steroid medication, officials have said. The long-time friend, who asked that her name not be published, said she felt <PERSON> Hearin </PERSON>'s ordeal has been made more painful by continuing attention from the media. `` It would be better to leave him alone,'' she said.

 A Korean-American businessman accused of trying to buy deadly nerve gas for export was held on $ 2 million bail after a prosecutor argued the man might flee to his high-level contacts overseas. Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Singer </PERSON> said <PERSON> Juwhan </PERSON> <PERSON> Yun </PERSON>, 49, `` bragged that he had close personal contacts with high-ranking civilian and military officials in many countries,'' including <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>, the People's Republic of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> magistrate <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Hedges </PERSON> set the $ 2 million figure at a bail hearing Tuesday for <PERSON> Yun </PERSON> of Short Hills. <PERSON> Yun </PERSON> had not posted bail as of Tuesday night, and his lawyer said he will ask the man's friends to help. <PERSON> Hedges </PERSON> imposed strict travel restrictions, ordered <PERSON> Yun </PERSON>'s family to surrender their passports and forbade <PERSON> Yun </PERSON> to make overseas contacts should bail be met. <PERSON> Yun </PERSON> was arrested Thursday and charged with conspiring to illegally export the nerve gas sarin, possibly to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. The complaint said <PERSON> Yun </PERSON> also discussed acquiring anti-aircraft and anti-tank missiles and military radar equipment with an undercover agent. <PERSON> Yun </PERSON> has pleaded innocent. The magistrate said that even though the crime was not a violent one, it was serious enough to merit high bail. `` If true, -LRB- the charge -RRB- certainly demonstrates an attempt by the defendant to profit from death to others,'' <PERSON> Hedges </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Yun </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dratch </PERSON>, said he hoped <PERSON> Yun </PERSON>'s friends might be willing to post their property as surety. <PERSON> Yun </PERSON> owns a $ 400,000 <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> condominium and lives in a $ 650,000 house but had a total equity _ excluding mortgages _ of only $ 350,000, which <PERSON> Hedges </PERSON> said could go toward the bail. <PERSON> Dratch </PERSON> said <PERSON> Yun </PERSON> earned $ 150,000 a year from his import-export business. <PERSON> Hedges </PERSON> said he doubted <PERSON> Yun </PERSON> could support a wife, three children, extensive travel and $ 64,800 in yearly mortgage payments on that amount. Ms. <PERSON> Singer </PERSON> added that <PERSON> Yun </PERSON> had recently bought a new luxury car. <PERSON> Yun </PERSON> entered the courtroom shackled. His wife sat in the second row, her hands clasped in her lap and her eyes closed through most of the hearing. Ms. Singer disclosed that <PERSON> Yun </PERSON> had sought to acquire <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> 19-3 grenade launchers during the seven months of negotiations with the undercover agent. The 40 mm weapon, acquired by the Army five years ago, can fire up to 375 grenades a minute. When the arrest was announced, officials said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> at one point was identified as the nerve gas's destination, but that was not verified and no foreign government officials appeared to be involved. Ms. <PERSON> Singer </PERSON> told <PERSON> Hedges </PERSON> that <PERSON> Yun </PERSON> was planning an around-the-world trip in January to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. Also, she identified as French citizens two men who met with <PERSON> Yun </PERSON> and an accused co-conspirator in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> over the nerve gas deal. Authorities have said they were trying to identify the men, who were under surveillance at the meeting. A warrant has been issued for the second man, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Caplan </PERSON> of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. Authorities said they were considering the possibility of seeking his extradition. <PERSON> Dratch </PERSON> said <PERSON> Yun </PERSON> came to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1972 and was naturalized six years later after receiving a master's degree from the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Graduate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION>.

 Radical students carrying sledgehammers attacked and damaged a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cultural center today in <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION>, hurling firebombs and rocks and attempting to burn down the building, authorities said. Police in the southern provincial city said about 50 students rushed into the compound yelling anti-American slogans and threw stones and about 50 firebombs. They said about 15 protesters climbed onto the roof and tried to start a fire. `` Drive out <ORGANIZATION> Yankee </ORGANIZATION> imperialists,'' attackers chanted during the attack in the city 180 miles south of <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>. A <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> said no one was injured in the attack and the protesters did not get inside the cultural center. He said 30 windows were broken, one official vehicle was damaged and tiles were ripped from the roof when attackers tried to set the building on fire. Parts of the building and a police post were damaged by firebombs, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> spokesman said. At least one <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official was in the building at the time, but the staff locked the doors and waited to be rescued, the spokesman said. The police who routinely guard the building were too few to stop the attack, he said. Riot police drove the attackers off with tear gas and arrested two who had scaled the roof and were shouting slogans through a bullhorn, police officials said. The other attackers fled, they said. The attackers also denounced President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> <PERSON> Tae-woo </PERSON>, chanting, `` Down with <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> Tae-woo.'' The attackers unfurled a banner on the roof saying, `` Punish <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> <PERSON> Tae-woo </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> Yankees </ORGANIZATION>, the enemies of our nation.'' About 100 other students watched and applauded the attackers, but did not take part and were dispersed when riot police arrived, the officials said. Police said the attackers were from <ORGANIZATION> Chonnam </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION>. The attack came shortly after about 200 students battled riot police with firebombs at <ORGANIZATION> Chosun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION>, police said. Riot police fired tear gas to disperse the radicals in that incident, they said. The <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION> center is operated by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> to sponsor cultural activities and serve as an information center for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. It provides a library and other facilities to residents. The incident came the day after <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> told a nationally televised news conference that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops must remain in the country until peace is achieved with communist <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. Radical students have staged a series of attacks on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomatic buildings in recent months, demanding an end to <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> influence in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and withdrawal of the 42,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops based in the nation under a mutual defense treaty. The radicals, who have little public support, claim the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has backed military rule in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> keeps troops in the south to block unification with <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have said <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> forces will remain in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> as long as their presence is deemed necessary by <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> leaders. American forces have been based in the country since the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> intervened to help the south against the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> invasion that triggered the 1950-53 Korean War.

<TEXT>
 The investigation of the 1980 assassination of Archbishop <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Romero </PERSON> will continue despite the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s refusal to extradite a former army captain implicated in the murder, says President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON> <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>. He told reporters on Tuesday during a visit to a downtown hospital construction site that the government has continued trying to solve the case and `` we will continue as far as we can.'' `` The case definitely is not closed,'' Justice Minister <PERSON> Julio </PERSON> <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Samayoa </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. Some believe the case was effectively closed last month when the country's highest court refused to extradite former Capt. <PERSON> Alvaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Saravia </PERSON> from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. In 1987, <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>'s administration accused <PERSON> Saravia </PERSON> of arranging the assassination of <PERSON> Romero </PERSON>, who was slain while saying Mass in March 1980. During his weekly homilies, <PERSON> Romero </PERSON> had called on soldiers and security forces to halt the then-rampant murders of suspected leftists. <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> alleges <PERSON> Saravia </PERSON> acted on orders from <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Aubuisson </PERSON>, a cashiered army intelligence major and leader of the rightist <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> political party, known as <PERSON> Arena </PERSON>. <PERSON> D'Aubuisson </PERSON> allegedly directed right-wing death squads in the early 1980s, but denies any link to death squads and any responsibility in <PERSON> Romero </PERSON>'s murder. <PERSON> Arena </PERSON> accuses the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> of bringing up the case before every election in an effort to erode its electoral base. <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> holds presidential elections March 19. Arena, which won legislative and municipal elections in last March, leads the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> in recent polls. <PERSON> Saravia </PERSON>, 46, was freed Thursday from the <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> jail where he had spent 13 months awaiting resolution of the extradition request and illegal immigration charges pending against him. He lives in the <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> suburb of <PERSON> Kendall </PERSON>, and his attorney said he is seeking political asylum. The <ORGANIZATION> Salvadoran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled Dec. 19 that testimony linking <PERSON> Saravia </PERSON> to the assassination was not credible.

 A piece of radioactive iridium missing from a construction site wound up in a welder's home in the eastern Chinese city of <LOCATION> Nanking </LOCATION> and contaminated at least 14 people, a newspaper reported today. One man was hospitalized with third-degree radiation burns on his left leg but there was no sign of harm to the other 13 people, the pro-Beijing Chinese-language <PERSON> Wen </PERSON> <PERSON> Wei </PERSON> <PERSON> Po </PERSON> said. The Iridium-192, which emits beta and gamma radiation, was found missing Dec. 22 from a <LOCATION> Nanking </LOCATION> construction site, the newspaper said. It said the material resembled a stick used to beat what the Chinese call a `` wooden fish,'' a popular percussion instrument made of a hollow wooden block. Police and health authorities immediately began searching for the iridium with radiation monitoring equipment, which picked up a signal Dec. 27 from the home of welder <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuqiang </PERSON>. Many people had been to <PERSON> Wang </PERSON>'s home to view his new color television and electronic games, and up to 47 people may have been exposed to the material, the report said. <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> was hospitalized with a leg injury after receiving what the newspaper described as a `` small dose'' of radiation. The newspaper said his life was not in danger. It did not say how the material was being used at the construction site or what <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> was doing with it. <PERSON> Wen </PERSON> <PERSON> Wei </PERSON> <PERSON> Po </PERSON> said authorities were investigating the incident.

 State agencies last year investigated more than 11,000 cases of human rights violations in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, including torture, illegal arrests and unwarranted search and seizure, the nation's leading newspaper reported today In an unusual report, the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> said more than 50 high-ranking officials, 2,600 government workers, including policemen, and 1,250 employees of collective enterprises committed such violations. The story cited an example of Officer <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiugang </PERSON>, a policeman from <LOCATION> Hengyang </LOCATION>, a city in <LOCATION> Hunan </LOCATION> province, who took bribes to have criminals released from jail. <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> traveled to <LOCATION> Canton </LOCATION> province nine times and secured the release of 36 prisoners using bogus letters of introduction, the paper said. For his services, he was bribed $ 1,784 _ or about 50 times the average Chinese police officer's monthly salary, the paper said. Last year, <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> was arrested and sentenced to 10 years in jail. The report said that of the 11,300 cases investigated last year, 4,454 involved wrongful charges, forced confessions, torture, illegal arrests and unwarranted search and seizure. Other cases concerned dereliction of duty and using one's office for profit, it said. One of the cases cited was a fire in <LOCATION> Daxinganling </LOCATION> in northeastern <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in May 1987 which left 193 people dead and millions of acres burned. In all, 11 people were sentenced to prison terms for dereliction of duty. One official involved ordered fire trucks to protect his own house while the fire ravaged an oil depot and a grain warehouse, the report said. Another official, at the time the head of a fire prevention bureau, fled the fire on a motorcycle, it said. The article was unusual in that it openly mentioned torture, forced confessions and illegal search and seizure. It also acknowledged that many of the cases were difficult to crack because `` those prosecuted were government workers.'' <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has acknowledged that torture and other breaches of human rights were frequent during the 10-year ultra-leftist Cultural Revolution that ended in 1976. Little criticism has since been tolerated of the state's internal security bureaus, though lawyers say several Chinese have recently sued the police for wrongful arrest and won. Later this year, the government is expected to come out with legislation allowing citizens to sue other government bureaus. Chinese lawyers say they are working to raise people's consciousness of their rights Recent cases, such as that of two models who sued the prestigious <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION>, are being widely publicized to teach people about invasion of privacy and other rights. The models are suing because they said the academy used pictures of them in an exhibition of nudes without asking their permission. The case has yet to be decided. Discussion of rights breaks down, however, when political freedoms are raised. The government clearly states that no criticism of the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> or socialism is allowed. `` We are trying to set a foundation,'' said one lawyer in a recent interview. `` It would be asking too much for <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> to grant political freedoms at this point.''

 Rioting that left at least three blacks dead came as <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> was trying to absorb 200 asylum-seeking Nicaraguans a day and coincided with the city's hopes to polish its tarnished image with the Super Bowl. Tensions have been simmering among some blacks over what they perceive as unjust treatment from police and feelings of frustration concerning the attention given to the Nicaraguan newcomers, community leaders said. The hoopla over the Super Bowl _ with the city showing off its new skyline, new bayside attractions and improved image _ may have added to the disaffection. The fatal shooting of a 23-year-old black motorcyclist by a white police officer Monday evening provided the spark, they said. `` There have been a lot of other tensions the last few weeks. They just needed a catalyst,'' said state Rep. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Burke </PERSON>, who represents <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. `` These people involved could care less about the Super Bowl being here. It's not going to help their lives.'' The motorcyclist's 24-year-old passenger died Tuesday afternoon, and a young <PERSON> black </PERSON> man was shot to death early today as violence spread from the poor <LOCATION> Overtown </LOCATION> section to <LOCATION> Liberty </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, about 30 blocks to the northwest. `` It's really close to what happened before in 1980,'' said <PERSON> Garth </PERSON> <PERSON> Reeves </PERSON>, long-time publisher of the black-oriented newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, referring to the acquittal of <LOCATION> Metro-Dade </LOCATION> police officers charged with beating a black man to death. The acquittals sparked three days of riots that killed 18 people and caused hundreds of millions of dollars in damage. The outbreak of violence in 1980 came as 125,000 Cuban refugees were arriving in the Mariel boatlift. <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Simms </PERSON> of the Community Relations Board said the warning signs of this week's violence were apparent. He said his group keeps a weekly `` tension chart'' and had voiced alarm in recent weeks when it saw levels similar to 1980 and 1982. But, as in the past, perceptions of violence likely will linger after the violence subsides. `` This really puts a damper on literally hundreds of thousands of volunteer hours that have been put in by this community preparing for the -LRB- Sunday's -RRB- Super Bowl,'' said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferguson </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Beacon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, which promotes <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. `` It's not that we have things that are any different from other urban areas; it's just that the timing of how they occur is absolutely incredible,'' he added. `` An incident like this you do n't ever want to happen, but it's just doubly unfortunate that it happens this week. <ORGANIZATION> Houston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> sports writer <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Buck </PERSON>, whose car windshield was shattered in Monday night's violence, said publicity about the violence will cancel out <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>'s hospitality this week. `` Unfortunately, I think a lot of good effort was ruined in one short three - or four-hour period,'' he said `` A year of hard work went down the drain.''

 The debut of the <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> 2 space rocket next month and that of the powerful Titan 4 a few weeks later highlight the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>'s busiest launch year here since 1983, an official says. The Pentagon is counting on both rockets to help orbit a backlog of about 25 national defense payloads that have been grounded since the 1986 explosions of the space shuttle Challenger and an unpiloted Titan 34D rocket. Problems that have held up the two launches for months are being resolved, <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Col. <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gooch </PERSON>, commander of the Eastern Space and Missile Center, told reporters Tuesday. The <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> 2 will carry two military navigation satellites on its first flight Feb. 7 and the Titan 4, which will be <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s most powerful expendable rocket, will hoist a classified payload a few weeks later, <PERSON> Gooch </PERSON> said. The 1989 launch schedule calls for seven military <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> 2s, two commercial <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> 2s and one <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> 1; two Titan 4s, two smaller Titan 34Ds and two commercial Titan 3s; two commercial Atlas-Centaurs and one with a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> communications satellite; and six to eight submarine test launches of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s powerful new Trident 2 nuclear missile. The missile center also will support seven <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> space shuttle launchings during 1989, starting with Discovery on Feb. 23. The schedule of 32 to 34 launches would be the busiest here since 1983, when there were 60. There were 26 in 1987. Launch slippages and a shortage of manpower could hold the total down, <PERSON> Gooch </PERSON> said. `` With luck we could support that rate, but if we can get 70 percent up, we will have earned our pay.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> decided to build the <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> 2 and to significantly increase its Titan 4 order after space shuttle Challenger exploded on Jan. 26, 1986. The Pentagon and <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> had been phasing out unpiloted rockets and had been putting all their launch eggs into one basket, the shuttle. The Challenger disaster convinced officials that strategy had been a mistake, and they ordered expendable rockets to ensure American access to space. <PERSON> Gooch </PERSON> estimated 40 military, commercial and <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> space payloads have backed up as a result of the 32-month standdown after the shuttle accident and because of the Titan 34D grounding for several months. About 25 of those are satellites vital to national defense, he said. <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canaveral </LOCATION> range may have problems supporting the schedule if there are delays in a lot of the missions, <PERSON> Gooch </PERSON> said. A shortage of people to handle launches could be another problem, <PERSON> Gooch </PERSON> said. The colonel said he has asked the Pentagon for about 100 people to add to the 200 he now has in his test operations group.

<HEAD>Journalists Take Government To Court Over Gag Order</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Journalists have taken the government to court over a ban on broadcast interviews with supporters of terrorist groups in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, saying the order is unlawful and restricts the freedom of information. Permission to bring the suit before the High Court was granted Tuesday `` with some hesitation,'' Lord Justice Sir <PERSON> Tasker </PERSON> <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> said. The full court hearing is expected by March. The ban ordered Oct. 19 by Home Secretary <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurd </PERSON> barred the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> from carrying interviews with spokesmen for 11 groups, including the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> and its legal wing, <ORGANIZATION> Sinn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fein </ORGANIZATION>; the <ORGANIZATION> Ulster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Ulster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Volunteer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>. The suit is the first court challenge to the ban, and there have been no prosecutions for violating it. <PERSON> Hurd </PERSON>'s order, issued after an upsurge of <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> violence, also banned the broadcast of words that supported, or invited support for, the banned organizations. However, broadcasters remained free to show pictures of the banned spokesmen and to paraphrase what they said. The <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> is fighting to end British rule in Protestant-dominated <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> and unite the province with the <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>, which is predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Pannick </PERSON>, an attorney for the journalists and television producers who sought to challenge the ban, argued that <PERSON> Hurd </PERSON>'s order was illegal. `` The directions are so perverse an interference with the free flow of information in a democratic society that this restriction on the freedom of expression is outside the discretionary powers which were conferred upon the Secretary of State by <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Pannick </PERSON> said. The court case is part of a campaign coordinated by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journalists </ORGANIZATION> against the restrictions. It is the main trade union representing press, radio, TV and magazine journalists in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. In November, the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspaper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Editors </ORGANIZATION> sent a letter to Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, protesting the ban. At the time the ban was announced, <PERSON> Hurd </PERSON> made it clear that the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Sinn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fein </ORGANIZATION> were the primary targets, and that his intention was to deny them publicity. `` What people hear on television is not the <ORGANIZATION> Sinn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fein </ORGANIZATION> politicians being grilled by journalists. What they hear is supporters of <ORGANIZATION> Sinn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fein </ORGANIZATION> glorying in violence and death. That is what we propose to stop,'' <PERSON> Hurd </PERSON> said. The challenge was brought by producers <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Brind </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Victoria </PERSON> <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>; broadcast journalists <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Emery </PERSON>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Pilger </PERSON> and <PERSON> Scarlett </PERSON> <PERSON> McGwire </PERSON>, who is also joint president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journalists </ORGANIZATION>, and union clerk <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Nash </PERSON>. In November, <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> authorities reportedly invoked the ban to prevent broadcast of a song by the popular Irish folk group <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pogues </ORGANIZATION> because its lyrics support 10 people convicted of <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> bombings. The Observer, a <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> weekly, said <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> ordered all commercial radio stations not to play the band's single `` Streets of Sorrow @ <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION> Six.'' The High Court is third highest on <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s legal ladder. The highest court is the Law Lords of the House of Lords. Immediately below that is the Court of Appeal.

 <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Purdy </PERSON> was a child alcoholic, drifting loner and gun lover, but his grandmother says he had no racial prejudice or other known motive to drive him to fire on a crowded schoolyard with mostly Oriental children. <PERSON> Julia </PERSON> <PERSON> Chumbley </PERSON> believes the reason behind her grandson's assault may have died with him when he took his own life Tuesday after using an assault rifle to kill five children and wound 29 others in <LOCATION> Stockton </LOCATION>, 15 miles south of here. `` I do n't understand why and I probably wo n't ever know why,'' <PERSON> Chumbley </PERSON>, a 63-year-old retired cannery worker, told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. `` I'm shocked. It's just horrible.'' Despite a troubled childhood and a long criminal record as an adult, <PERSON> Purdy </PERSON> lacked racial prejudices against Asians or other groups, hatreds or other outward signs that might have foreshadowed the disaster, according to his grandmother. `` As far as I know, he was not prejudiced. We're not a prejudiced family. We were n't raised that way,'' said <PERSON> Chumbley </PERSON>, who has lived for three decades in this town in the farming-rich <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Joaquin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>. `` When he was around here, he acted well,'' she said. <PERSON> Chumbley </PERSON> said her 26-year-old grandson, who also went by the alias <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> West </PERSON>, had only a normal interest in guns. `` All boys that age like guns,'' she said. `` It's normal for that age, is n't it?'' <PERSON> Purdy </PERSON>'s father, <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Purdy </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Lodi </LOCATION> cab company employee, was killed in September 1981 when he was struck by a car as he was crossing a rural road. The death disturbed the younger <PERSON> Purdy </PERSON>, but <PERSON> Chumbley </PERSON> said he seemed to have recovered from the loss. The elder <PERSON> Purdy </PERSON> also served in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, which did not seem to have any apparent influence on the younger <PERSON> Purdy </PERSON>, she said. <PERSON> Chumbley </PERSON> also said that to her knowledge her grandson never attended <ORGANIZATION> Cleveland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, where the attack took place. A majority of the school's pupils are children of Southeast Asian refugees. `` He seemed like a real nice young man,'' said <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, 45, who lives next door to <PERSON> Purdy </PERSON>'s aunt in the <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, suburb of <PERSON> Sandy </PERSON>, where the young man lived from July through October last year. `` He was here looking for work.'' But while <PERSON> Purdy </PERSON> was in Sandy last August, he also purchased the AK-47 assault rifle used in the rampage, police said. <PERSON> Sandy </PERSON> Police Chief <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Punzel </PERSON> said <PERSON> Purdy </PERSON>'s aunt, <PERSON> Julie </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON>, told him the gunman had a troubled upbringing, a prelude to what <PERSON> Stockton </PERSON> police described as an `` extensive criminal history,'' including convictions for weapons, narcotics and soliciting for sex. `` She told me he was a loner and as a child he was an alcoholic,'' <PERSON> Punzel </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Purdy </PERSON> visited his grandmother about twice a year, using her address to pick up his mail, which included magazines on the welding trade. She said his parents were married in <PERSON> Stockton </PERSON>, then divorced after a short time. His mother remarried and took <PERSON> Purdy </PERSON> to the <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tahoe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nev. </LOCATION>, region and then to the <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION> area. He dropped out of high school and began drifting about 10 years ago, criss-crossing the nation looking for work, his grandmother said. He visited her occasionally and used her address to receive mail. <PERSON> Punzel </PERSON> said Mrs. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> told him <PERSON> Purdy </PERSON> left <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> for a job as a boilermaker in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. That job fell through and he went to <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Tenn </PERSON>. The aunt and uncle last heard from <PERSON> Purdy </PERSON> at Thanksgiving, when he was in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Punzel </PERSON> said. he had a girlfriend for a time in <PERSON> Stockton </PERSON>, his grandmother said. `` But that was some time ago,'' she added. Early last year, he began attending vocational classes in welding at <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Joaquin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Stockton </LOCATION>. `` It troubles me to think that such a terrible thing can happen,'' <PERSON> Chumbley </PERSON> said. `` It's like a nightmare.'' In a weary voice, she added, `` This is the sort of thing that happens to others. Not to you. Your own grandson.''

 A weary and frustrated Mayor <PERSON> Xavier </PERSON> <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON> is reaching out to blacks in an attempt to stem the violence and tension that has fractured his city for two days. <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON> promised an intensive investigation into the fatal shooting of an unarmed black motorcyclist by a white Hispanic police officer Monday, which triggered the wave of gunfire, lootings and arson in the city's <LOCATION> Overtown </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Liberty </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> districts. `` We will not rest until we come to the bottom of what happened to spark this riot,'' said <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON> in a televised appeal for calm Tuesday night. `` We must curb our anger with restraint. We must turn our fear into strength, for our families and our city.'' His appeal came after the apparent failure of a police strategy to end the riots by avoiding major confrontations with angry blacks in <LOCATION> Overtown </LOCATION> on Monday night. But despite a tranquil morning in <LOCATION> Overtown </LOCATION>, violence was renewed Tuesday night and spread to <LOCATION> Liberty </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, where a young <PERSON> black </PERSON> man was fatally shot and six other people were wounded. Minutes after Monday's fatal shooting, <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON> attempted to intervene between police and an angry crowd. At one point, he walked up to a hostile crowd that had gathered near the body of the dead motorcyclist and asked for calm. But his efforts were met with a shower of rocks and bottles. City Manager <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> <PERSON> Odio </PERSON>, watching with police down the street, told an officer: `` Somebody go get him, he's crazy.'' But <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON> stood his ground and promised the angry gathering: `` I promise you to look into this. I will get to the bottom of this.'' When the 39-year-old <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON> was re-elected to his second two-year term, he claimed 62 percent of the vote and a majority among the city's three major groups _ English-speaking whites, Hispanics and blacks. He saw the vote as a sign of better relations between the three groups. He points to his efforts to provide affordable housing projects in <LOCATION> Overtown </LOCATION>, the building of the nearby <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arena </LOCATION> and his frequent visits to the <LOCATION> Overtown </LOCATION> community as signs of progress. The Cuban-born <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON> grew up in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, and moved to <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> in 1975. He ran unsuccessfully for the City Commission and for mayor before his election in 1985. He runs as an independent, but he is a strong supporter of President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON> is an attorney with a law degree from <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION>. The married father of four has been described in national publications as sign that the <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> immigrants are coming of age in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. But <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Perry </PERSON>, former leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Greater </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advancement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colored </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION>, said a year ago that the Cubans' gain could be perceived as the blacks' loss unless <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON> does more to build unity. And on Tuesday, <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON> was defending his record in the black community and looking for a way out of the nightmare sparked by the police shooting. `` <LOCATION> Overtown </LOCATION> was neglected but now is the area in which the city has been making its greatest effort with the largest urban renewal project _ affordable housing _ possibly in the entire nation,'' he said.

<HEAD>Jurors May Convict Steinberg of Murder Even If He Didn't Strike Fatal
Blow</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A jury may convict <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> of beating his illegally adopted daughter to death even if they find he did not strike the fatal blow, the trial judge said. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Justice <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Rothwax </PERSON> said Tuesday if the jurors find <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> was aware the child was injured and in danger, and that she died as a result of action or inaction by him, then they may convict him of murder. <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>, 47, a disbarred millionaire lawyer, is charged with second-degree murder in the beating death of 6-year-old <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>, the girl he illegally obtained at birth from an unwed teen and raised as his own. The child was removed unconscious from his <ORGANIZATION> Greenwich </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Village </ORGANIZATION> apartment on Nov. 2, 1987. She died of a brain injury three days later at a nearby hospital. The prosecution charges <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> hit the girl, but even if he killed her unintentionally, he acted `` recklessly'' and showed a `` depraved indifference'' to her life by allowing her to lie unconscious for 12 hours without seeking help. The judge said he will submit for the jury's consideration the four homicide counts available in this state. They are second-degree murder, first-and second-degree manslaughter and criminally negligent homicide. The judge denied defense motions to throw out the homicide charges saying there was `` sufficient evidence'' to sustain them. Defense lawyer <PERSON> Adrian </PERSON> <PERSON> DiLuzio </PERSON> asked <PERSON> Rothwax </PERSON> to drop the charges on the ground that the only evidence implicating <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> in the child's death came from an accomplice, <PERSON> Hedda </PERSON> <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON>, <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>'s former live-in companion `` I will charge that <PERSON> Hedda </PERSON> <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON> is an accomplice as a matter of law'' in the death of <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON>, <PERSON> Rothwax </PERSON> said. This means the panel may consider her testimony only if there is corroborating _ supporting _ evidence. `` It seems to me there is ample corroboration of the accomplice testimony in this case,'' the judge said, `` and the motion to dismiss those counts on that ground will be denied.'' <PERSON> Rothwax </PERSON> granted a defense motion to drop the endangering the welfare of a child charge with respect to <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON>. `` I'm disinclined to submit that count to the jury,'' he said. He called the charge a `` distraction'' and said <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> has already served more than the one-year maximum for that count anyway since he has been held without bail since November 1987. The prosecution and defense have rested in the case and the defense is expected to give closing arguments on Thursday. The prosecution will sum up on Friday and <PERSON> Rothwax </PERSON> will give his final instructions to the jurors on Monday just before they begin deliberating. <PERSON> Rothwax </PERSON> cautioned <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>'s lawyers against saying anything in summation that sounds like an insanity defense. `` You can call it insanity or you can call it vanilla,'' <PERSON> Rothwax </PERSON> said, warning that he will reopen the trial, now in its 12th week, and allow the prosecution psychiatrist to testify about his interviews last week with <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> if defense lawyers say anything that smacks of an insanity defense. `` We have no intention of arguing insanity,'' <PERSON> DiLuzio </PERSON> said. The judge also said he will tell the jurors that he allowed them to see and hear evidence that Ms. <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON>, 46, a former children's book editor, was battered by <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> only so they could assess her state of mind at the time of <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON>'s death and evaluate her testimony accordingly

 <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sr. </PERSON>, a rancher who returned from World War I with $ 1.50 in his pocket and forged a multimillion-dollar empire, was remembered as a pioneer and entrepreneur following his death at age 95 in a car crash. `` He was part of this Valley. He loved this Valley,'' his son, Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, said upon arriving Tuesday night from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> was pronounced dead at the scene of Tuesday morning's accident at a rural intersection of <LOCATION> Hidalgo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> in the Lower <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Wells </PERSON> Gov. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Clements </PERSON> called <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> `` a great <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> entrepreneur who contributed much to the people of our state, particularly those in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> was `` an entrepreneur whose leadership and character have long since made him a legend in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> has lost a true pioneer and a great citizen,'' added Sen. <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON>, R-Texas. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> remained active with his farming, ranching and real estate interests until his death and showed no physical evidence of the two times in his long career he was trampled by stampeding cattle. `` He was here two or three times a week, sometimes every day,'' said <PERSON> Bud </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, foreman for the past 25 years at <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s 16,000-acre La Coma Ranch in <LOCATION> Hidalgo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, one of six ranches <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> owned <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> held nearly 50,000 acres of farms and ranches scattered on a <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> empire he began carving out of brush near the Mexican border in 1920. He was on the stage during part of last summer's Democratic National Convention, where his son was named the party's vice presidential candidate. The senior <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> was one of six children of Danish parents who settled before the turn of the century on a small <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> farm. He had little time as a child for school and none at all after age 13, when he followed the grain harvest across <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Dakotas </LOCATION>. The incidental injuries in breaking wild horses were nothing compared to a motorcycle accident in 1915 in which <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> broke several bones and almost lost his life. After months of treatment, he fled the hospital and, following several rejections, eventually tricked a drunken recruiting officer into enlisting him in the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. In 1920, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> returned from the war and persuaded <PERSON> Edna </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> <PERSON> Colbath </PERSON> _ his `` Dolly'' _ to marry him. He had $ 1.50 in his pocket. After the wedding, he borrowed $ 500 and began building his empire. Police said Tuesday the elder <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> apparently failed to yield the right of way at a stop sign. Two people in the other car were injured. <PERSON> Ramiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosalez </PERSON>, 22, was treated and released, and his sister <PERSON> Margarita </PERSON>, 19, who required facial surgery, was in stable condition at <LOCATION> Mission </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, hospital officials said.

 Surrealist painter <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON> <PERSON> Dali </PERSON> was in stable condition today in the intensive care unit of a <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> hospital after suffering heart failure, doctors said. A six-doctor team at <ORGANIZATION> Figueras </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> said the 84-year-old artist was in no immediate health danger. In a medical statement this morning, the doctors said, `` If there is no major change in his condition, no further medical statements will be issued until Friday.'' <PERSON> Dali </PERSON> has suffered chronic heart ailments in recent years. He has been hospitalized three times the last two months for severe heart trouble and in 1986 underwent surgery to receive a pacemaker. <PERSON> Dali </PERSON>, a founding member of the surrealist movement, is the last of an outstanding generation of <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> painters that included <PERSON> Pablo </PERSON> <PERSON> Picasso </PERSON>, who died in 1973, and <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Miro </PERSON>, who died a decade later. The statement did not mention whether <PERSON> Dali </PERSON> suffered a lung clot, although earlier a hospital spokesman had said such a clot had aggravated the artist's condition. The team signing the statement included the artist's longtime physician, <PERSON> Carles </PERSON> <PERSON> Punsati </PERSON>, and five other doctors. Hospital spokeswoman <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> said by telephone that <PERSON> Dali </PERSON> `` was resting comfortably,'' but she did not elaborate. Doctors permitted <PERSON> Dali </PERSON> to return home Dec. 25 after a three-day stay in the same hospital for treatment of an intestinal lesion. Before that, the painter spent 16 days in <ORGANIZATION> Barcelona </ORGANIZATION>'s Quiron Clinic in extremely critical condition due to severe heart trouble aggravated by clots in his left lung. He was released Dec. 14. A native of Figuras, 60 miles north of <LOCATION> Barcelona </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dali </PERSON> has been in poor health and wheelchair-bound since August 1984, when he suffered severe burns in a fire in the bedroom of <LOCATION> Pubol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Castle </LOCATION>, his residence at the time, in nearby La <PERSON> Pera </PERSON>. He was hospitalized for three months after the fire before moving to Galatea Tower. He has since lived in seclusion, fed by gastro-nasal tube and watched round-the-clock by a team of nurses.

<TEXT>
 A record number of community hospitals closed for the sixth year in a row last year, the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said, promising to fight any further cuts in federal <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> and Medicaid funding. Eighty-one hospitals in 28 states shut down in 1988, the organization said Tuesday. The <LOCATION> Southwest </LOCATION> was hardest hit, with 18 closings in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> alone. In addition, 21 non-community hospitals closed in 15 states, the association said. Community hospitals are generally defined as those not serving a specific group like a university, military base or prison. They can be publicly or privately owned. Non-community hospitals typically provide rehabilitative or long-term care. The closings were primarily due to inadequate Medicare and Medicaid payments for treatment of the elderly and poor, said association President <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>. `` Hospitals can not lose money or barely break even year after year and remain open,'' Ms. <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> said. `` It's just that simple.'' She said the association would `` pull out all the stops'' to stop cuts in <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> and improve health care funding for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s indigent Since 1980, 445 community hospitals have closed, and the number has increased steadily since 1982, the association said. Forty-three of the 81 community hospitals that closed in 1988 were rural. `` For the last several years, seven out of 10 rural hospitals and 50 percent of urban hospitals have lost money caring for patients,'' Ms. <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> said. For most hospitals, profit margins are disappearing, and they can not cut costs to stay open, said association vice president <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>. `` The problem is not excess expenses,'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said. `` The ones that close have gone through draconian cost cutting measures. The problem is one of revenue.''

<HEAD>Firm That Allegedly Helped Libyans Refit Warplanes Under Investigation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MUNICH, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Prosecutors said today that they have begun a criminal investigation of a Bavarian firm that a news magazine says helped <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> develop the ability for in-flight refueling of warplanes. <LOCATION> Munich </LOCATION> Prosecutor <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON> <PERSON> Stocker </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Intec </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Logistic </ORGANIZATION> company was suspected of violating <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s export laws He said the probe was focusing on whether `` -LRB- fuel -RRB- tank equipment sent to <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> required an export permit.'' `` We do n't know what was done with this equipment in <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>. That is something that must be examined,'' <PERSON> Stocker </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in a telephone interview. He did not elaborate on the equipment sent to <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> and said he could not give out other details. It was not immediately clear whether investigators were also looking into a report by <ORGANIZATION> Der </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Spiegel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> magazine </ORGANIZATION> that <ORGANIZATION> Intec </ORGANIZATION> engineers had helped refit Libyan warplanes so they can be refueled in mid-flight. Prosecutors also did not say whether the investigation was at all related to the involvement by West German companies in the construction and outfitting of a suspected chemical weapons plant in <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Der </PERSON> <PERSON> Spiegel </PERSON> reported this week that 10 Intec-hired engineers were playing a key role in helping <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> fit warplanes and transport planes with equipment necessary for in-flight refueling. `` In addition to the construction of its own chemical weapons plant, <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> is re-equipping its air force with the goal of increasing the operations radius of its bombers to as far away as <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>,'' it said. `` For over two years, the German technicians have been involved in turning Hercules transport planes into flying gas stations'' for <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Spiegel </PERSON> said. It alleged that Intec-hired engineers are also equipping Libyan warplanes with the special devices needed for mid-air refueling. The Hamburg-based magazine said the work has been going on at a `` tightly guarded air base'' near <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Spiegel </PERSON> quoted an official with the Bavarian firm as denying the company was guilty of any wrongdoing. <ORGANIZATION> Intec </ORGANIZATION> `` has nothing to do with construction work on airplanes in <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>,'' the magazine quoted <PERSON> Ingo </PERSON> <PERSON> Moehring </PERSON> as saying. <PERSON> Moehring </PERSON> is the son of <PERSON> Eberhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Moehring </PERSON>, identifed by <PERSON> Spiegel </PERSON> as owner of the Bavarian firm. <PERSON> Ingo </PERSON> <PERSON> Moehring </PERSON> said the company last year had only delivered `` metal, rivets and nuts'' to <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Spiegel </PERSON> reported. <ORGANIZATION> Intec </ORGANIZATION> is based in <LOCATION> Vatterstetten </LOCATION>, which is located near <LOCATION> Munich </LOCATION>.

 Seven <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airlines that fly <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737s similar to the British <ORGANIZATION> Midland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> airliner that crashed Jan. 8 in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> say they found no wiring problems during inspections ordered by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. But one airline conducting an unrelated inspection found other wiring foulups in two larger <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 757 aircraft. <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> officials in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> said they were concerned about an apparent delay in reporting the problem in another case. Officials of <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Piedmont </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday that all their 737-300s had been checked and no cross-wiring or other problem was found in engine warning systems. The 737 inspections resulted from speculation that crosed-wiring might have misled the pilot of the British <LOCATION> Midland </LOCATION> jet to shut down his good right engine after the left one caught fire. Officials have yet to determine the cause of the crash, which killed 44 people, but they say they found no evidence of a problem with the right engine except that it had been shut down. American and <PERSON> Aloha </PERSON> airlines officials did not immediately respond to inquiries about the testing, but <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Buckhorn </PERSON> said it appeared there were no problems with any of the airlines covered by the `` airworthiness directive.'' He said, however, the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> had not yet compiled all the reports from airlines. <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION>, responding to another <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> order covering fire sprinkler systems in <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 757 cargo holds, said Tuesday it found faulty wiring in two of its aircraft. That brings to seven the total number of 757s found with such problems worldwide. One case of faulty wiring in a 757 was reported to <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> in August by <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brunei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, but <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> relayed the information to the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> only this month, <PERSON> Mitch </PERSON> <PERSON> Barker </PERSON> of the agency's <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> office told the <ORGANIZATION> Seattle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post-Intelligencer </ORGANIZATION>. `` <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> is under an obligation to look into these types of things and report them to the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Barker </PERSON> said Tuesday. `` There's some leeway in the process, but if there is a long delay that would be a concern to us. The reporting delay was a `` blip,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Jiminez </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>. `` It was a breakdown in communication. Generally -LRB- both manufacturer and carrier -RRB- report to the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION>, but in this case it just did n't happen. <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> orders cover only domestic airliners, but foreign carriers using <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> built aircraft generally comply with any safety inspections ordered. `` We're looking to see what happened in the system to allow this -LRB- faulty wiring -RRB- to happen, where it happened, how it happened, and to see how we can make it not happen again,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> said officials would not take any steps affecting production of new 757s until they received the results of the inspections from the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> orders covering 737s and 757s were not related, except that they both involved cross-wiring. The cargo-hold problems have been reported in another Delta-operated 757, one belonging to <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brunei </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, two owned by <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holland </ORGANIZATION>, and one operated by the British airline Air 2000. One of the Air Holland planes was being used by a charter company in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. Officials of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, which operates 25 of the 757s; <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>, which has 33; and <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION>, which has seven, said Tuesday that they found no problems with any of their planes. No other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airline operates the 757. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Lundy </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, said the carrier immediately notified the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> of the latest two cases and corrected the problems which would have prevented sprinklers from working properly in the event of a fire in a baggage hold. One airplane had a crossed-wiring problem that would have turned on the wrong sprinklers if a fire had broken out, <PERSON> Lundy </PERSON> said. The other had faulty wiring that would have warned the pilot of a fire but would not have activated the sprinklers, he said. He said it was a similar crossed-wiring problem found on a <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> plane before delivery from the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> factory that prompted the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> 757 airworthiness directive last week. Airlines had until Tuesday morning to complete the inspections and regular airline service was not affected, officials said.

 Hundreds of people rushed to hospitals in southern <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> today, hoping to find that loved ones had survived a train-bus collision in which at least 45 people were killed, officials said. Most of the dead were schoolchildren. Police and witnesses to Tuesday's crash said the bus driver apparently thought he could beat the express train, but his vehicle's engine stalled on the unguarded crossing about 43 miles south of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>. At a Cabinet meeting today, President <PERSON> Ranasinghe </PERSON> <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON> ordered all the country's 758 railway crossings to have gates installed by Monday, said spokesman <PERSON> Festus </PERSON> <PERSON> Perera </PERSON>. Seventy-one of the 120 mostly young people on the bus were injured, and six critically injured victims were taken to <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION> today for emergency surgery, police said. No one on the train was injured. The train, traveling at about 40 mph, knocked the bus about 150 feet down the track, witnesses said, and many bus passengers were hurled into a field. Others, most of them aged 5 to 15, were trapped inside the mangled vehicle. `` Bodies were all over ... Children were screaming,'' said a <ORGANIZATION> Buddhist </ORGANIZATION> priest who helped carry the injured to ambulances. Many of the victims could not easily be identified, and nurses asked relatives to check clothing for identification. At the crash site, police searched through bloodstained school books, pencils and shoes for clues to the victims' identities. `` We are working with badly mutilated bodies, some of them only limbs,'' said one police officer. Relatives crowded into the two government-run hospitals where the dead and injured were taken. One wailing mother walked through the hospital halls calling out, `` Inoka, <LOCATION> Inoka </LOCATION>.'' Nurses ran after her and stopped her from entering the morgue. <PERSON> Hema </PERSON> <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON>, the president's wife, visited the accident site and hospitals this morning, going from bed to bed trying to comfort the injured and console relatives of the dead. The bus had picked up children from four schools in <LOCATION> Amblangoda </LOCATION> and was headed toward <LOCATION> Urgasmanhandiya </LOCATION>, about 10 miles away, when the crash occurred. One witness said she tried to flag the bus down because she thought the driver probably could not see the train because of a light drizzle. But other witnesses and police said they thought the driver saw the train and still tried to make it across the track, especially since five children riding on the steps of the bus jumped out and escaped injury. The bus driver suffered minor injuries, they said.

<TEXT>
 Foreign Minister <PERSON> Jaromir </PERSON> <PERSON> Johanes </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> today dismissed harsh Western criticism of a police crackdown on dissidents in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> and said the demonstrators had broken the law by assembling. `` Anyone in this hall who wants to point the finger at other nations, including <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, should first of all look at himself,'' <PERSON> Johanes </PERSON> said. `` Acts in breach of legal and public order can not be tolerated by any government,'' he said, departing from his prepared text. `` Laws have to be observed by all.'' Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>, meanwhile, said upon arriving in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> that the Berlin Wall is not a subject for negotiations at the conference in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> on human rights and <LOCATION> East-West </LOCATION> relations. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>, scheduled to address the final session of the 35-nation conference on Thursday, also told reporters there are `` many areas in which -LRB- East and West -RRB- just disagree'' on human rights issues. <PERSON> Johanes </PERSON> spoke a day after police armed with truncheons broke up crowds of protesters in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Wenceslas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> for a third day, chasing hundreds of youths with water cannons. On Sunday, police used tear gas, batons, dogs and water cannons to break up 5,000 demonstrators gathered to remember <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Palach </PERSON>, a Czech student who killed himself in 1969 to protest the 1968 Soviet-led invasion of his homeland. On Monday, 14 prominent dissidents including banned playwright <PERSON> Vaclav </PERSON> <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> were detained after they tried to lay flowers in <PERSON> Palach </PERSON>'s memory. <PERSON> Havel </PERSON>, Charter 77 spokespersons <PERSON> Dana </PERSON> <PERSON> Nemcova </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sasha </PERSON> <PERSON> Vondra </PERSON> and the other 11 activists remained in detention today. In an interview with Austrian radio after his speech, <PERSON> Johanes </PERSON> said: `` What is happening in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> is not a violation of human rights.'' Asked what he meant by his comment that other countries should look at their own rights records, <PERSON> Johanes </PERSON> cited as an example the wave of arrests in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> in the past two days following rioting by blacks there. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> and <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> Foreign Secretary Sir <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> strongly criticized the Czechoslovak police action Tuesday, the first day of a three-day meeting of the foreign ministers from the 35 nations to wrap up new accords on human rights and security. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> violated the new accords just one hour after they were formally adopted Sunday by delegates who worked 27 months to draft them. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, however, praised the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> for recent economic and political reforms. Polish Foreign Minister <PERSON> Tadeusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Olechowski </PERSON>, speaking after his country's communist leaders set conditions for legalizing Solidarity, pledged his country would fully adhere to the accords reached in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>. `` I can assure you that <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> will scrupulously implement all the obligations which she has assumed,'' <PERSON> Olechowski </PERSON> said. `` We shall review the existing legislation to see whether it is consistent with these new recommendations and, where it is not, to introduce the necessary amendments. We shall expect similar moves by other states,'' he added. <PERSON> Johanes </PERSON> made no such pledge to review Czechoslovak laws, thus emphasizing the gap that opened up at the <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> conference between reformist nations in the Soviet bloc and those more reluctant to change. The accords call for new arms control talks between <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact to reduce conventional arms across <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Those negotiations are due to open in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> March 9. <PERSON> Johanes </PERSON> said the new talks `` will become an important practical test of the political resolve to reach tangible progress'' toward disarmament. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> was asked by reporters if the recently concluded agreement at the conference indicated the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall could now be dismantled. `` I do n't think that the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall is a subject for the <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> meeting,'' he said. `` Each state has the right to build its frontiers as it wishes and we must proceeed from there.''

<HEAD>Developer Abandons $120 Million Waterfront Project</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A developer is abandoning his $ 120 million <LOCATION> Penn </LOCATION>'s Landing mall and office project along the <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> about three months before its scheduled groundbreaking, calling it `` an expensive mistake.'' <PERSON> Willard </PERSON> <PERSON> Rouse </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, admitting `` deep regret and certainly embarrassment,'' said Tuesday he had received construction and marketing reports in the past three weeks showing rents in the first stage of development would n't balance costs. The major problems were a nationwide slump in retailing and a glut of office space in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, he said. City officials were shocked by the announcement after three years of negotiations and lengthy <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> hearings on the project on the waterfront where <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Penn </PERSON> and other English settlers landed more than 350 years ago. `` We are very disappointed and surprised,'' said <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hankowsky </PERSON>. `` Things had been moving along very well.'' Plans called for a hotel and a parking garage in addition to offices and stores. More buildings were contemplated in the next decade for an additional $ 400 million investment. The city had pledged to provide up to $ 19.5 million in subsidies for the project and to pay $ 2 million a year for maintenance as part of a lease agreement on the city-owned tract. <PERSON> Rouse </PERSON> was to pay rent of $ 100,000 a year plus a percentage of profits. <PERSON> Rouse </PERSON> had not signed the lease agreement, but had been expected to do so by the end of this month, <PERSON> Hankowsky </PERSON> said. The developer said it was more prudent to quit now, even though he already has spent $ 5 million on the project. `` It was an expensive mistake,'' he told a news conference at his <ORGANIZATION> Rouse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>' 21st-floor headquarters at One Liberty Place, the city's tallest building which he completed last year. `` It was a terribly challenging project we wanted to do, and it will take a while to get over it.'' Groundbreaking was to begin before May 1. Asked the consequences for <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Rouse </PERSON> replied, `` It leaves the city with a great piece of dirt.'' <PERSON> Hankowsky </PERSON> said city officials would re-evaluate the <LOCATION> Penn </LOCATION>'s Landing plan, and might negotiate with <PERSON> Rouse </PERSON> to build part of the project or seek proposals from other developers

The <ORGANIZATION> Long </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beach </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday also asked the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> district attorney to investigate Saturday's incident, in which <ORGANIZATION> NBC-TV </ORGANIZATION> filmed officer <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickey </PERSON> shoving <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s head into the store-front window. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> is a police sergeant in suburban <PERSON> Hawthorne </PERSON> on a leave pending the outcome of his race-related stress disability lawsuit against that city. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said he and off-duty state corrections officer <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> set up the self-styled `` sting'' with <ORGANIZATION> NBC-TV </ORGANIZATION> as part of an investigation into racism. `` We are involved. We have opened a ticket on it into possible civil rights violations,'' said <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. The tape showed <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> getting out of a car after being stopped by <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> officers. After a verbal exchange, an officer searching for weapons then shoved <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s head through the window. `` We will not tolerate any type of racism or brutality,'' said Mayor <PERSON> Ernie </PERSON> <PERSON> Kell </PERSON>. `` We need to find out what actually happened here and, if we were at fault, make sure it never happens again. We must get to the bottom of this.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Beck </PERSON>, said `` a lawsuit is inevitable.'' <PERSON> Kell </PERSON> said `` it is critical'' that the city get <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s complete unedited tape, but <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> attorneys said only those segments that were broadcast would be turned over. The mayor said the city would fight to get the tapes. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Tracy </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Long </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beach </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Officers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> board member, agreed that the entire tape was needed. `` We're incensed. All we are seeing is what <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> wants us to see,'' <PERSON> Tracy </PERSON> complained. `` We want to see a reverse angle. It could have been the officer's body part that went through that window.'' <PERSON> Dickey </PERSON> has asked to work in the police department's detective bureau until the case is resolved, <PERSON> Tracy </PERSON> said.

 Civil rights leader <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> says he is seeking to provide counseling to <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, who has been beset by questions over his personal and professional conduct. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said his concern over <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> is personal. He declined to defend or criticize <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>, who is involved in controversies surrounding his visit to the hotel room of a former city employee who police said was the subject of a drug investigation. `` I'm in no position to make a political evaluation of the current situation,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was quoted in today's editions of The Washington Post. `` My first consideration is his health and well-being.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said he planned to visit with <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> during his stay here for the inauguration of President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` I know the burden of being under attack. I have been there,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. `` People are hurt and their families are hurt.'' A poll commissioned by <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> station <ORGANIZATION> WUSA-TV </ORGANIZATION> found that <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> would be the overwhelming choice of both black and white voters if he were to run for mayor in 1990. But <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who has homes in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said he has no such plans. The poll also found that while 58 percent of the city's residents opposed a recall election, 44 percent would vote to oust <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> if the referendum were held. The survey of 506 registered voters Jan. 12-14 had an error rate of four percentage points. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> said Tuesday that he took a urine test earlier in the day as part of his annual physical. He has repeatedly denied ever using illegal drugs and said he never knowingly associated with drug dealers. The results of Tuesday's test were not immediately available. The mayor said earlier this month that he has submitted to drug tests as part of his annual checkup, has been found drug-free and that the results have been made public. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>'s press secretary and reporters could not recall any such new news release, however. The Post reported, meanwhile, that a woman who pleaded guilty to four counts of selling cocaine accompanied <PERSON> Jules </PERSON> <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON>, the legal counsel to the city personnel office, on a trip to the <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> last October as part of a joint personnel project between the <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> governments. <PERSON> April </PERSON> <PERSON> Herrell </PERSON>, a former nightclub dancer now living in a halfway house, confirmed she took the trip while awaiting sentencing. Ms. <PERSON> Herrell </PERSON>, 25, and <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> stayed at a luxurious <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Thomas </LOCATION> hotel, where the bill was paid by the <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> government, which since has objected to the spending by <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> and others on the project. The former project director, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, is the man <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> met several times in the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> hotel room just before Christmas.

 A prominent businessman has admitted paying a $ 1 million bribe to a black homeland leader, the latest in a series of corruption scandals involving leading politicians and executives. In a letter presented Tuesday to a judicial inquiry commission in <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION>, hotel and casino magnate <PERSON> Sol </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerzner </PERSON> acknowledged the 1986 payment to <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Matanzima </PERSON>, who at the time was leader of <LOCATION> Transkei </LOCATION>. The homeland's army overthrew <PERSON> Matanzima </PERSON> in December 1987, accusing him of corruption. <PERSON> Kerzner </PERSON> is deputy chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Sun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, which has built luxury hotels and casinos throughout the region, including the internationally known <LOCATION> Sun </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> resort in <LOCATION> Bophuthatswana </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Kerzner </PERSON> said the payment was made to preserve <ORGANIZATION> Sun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>'s monopoly on gambling licenses in <LOCATION> Transkei </LOCATION> He accused <PERSON> Matanzima </PERSON> of placing `` undue pressure'' on Sun International by threatening to grant another company the right to open a casino in the impoverished homeland. <PERSON> Kerzner </PERSON> said he acted jointly with <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Bloomberg </PERSON>, a business associate who was once the mayor of <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>. The men issued a joint statement to the inquiry commission acknowledging the bribe. Attorney <PERSON> Fanie </PERSON> <PERSON> Cilliers </PERSON>, who is representing <PERSON> Kerzner </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Bloomberg </ORGANIZATION>, said there is no law in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> against bribing an official from a foreign government. <LOCATION> Transkei </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bophuthatswana </LOCATION> are designated independent by <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, although they are not recognized abroad. Prosecutors and investigative commissions have uncovered several other scandals in recent weeks. Among them: _ An investigative committee this week asked the state to prosecute <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> member <PERSON> Peet </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Pontes </PERSON> for alleged fraud and perjury in connection with smuggling an Italian drug financier into the country <PERSON> Vito </PERSON> <PERSON> Palazzolo </PERSON>, the bankroller for the $ 1.6 billion `` Pizza Connection'' international drug network, arrived in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> in December 1986 on a false passport after fleeing <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> while on a prison furlough. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Pontes </PERSON>, who was a rising star in President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, claims he had no knowledge of <PERSON> Palazzolo </PERSON>'s criminal record when he offered him assistance to settle in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> He has refused to quit <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> has sued an Afrikaans-language newspaper, Free Weekly, for libel over a story that said he and Foreign Minister <PERSON> Pik </PERSON> <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> had dinner with <PERSON> Palazzolo </PERSON>. The newspaper said its story was based on a sworn statement given to police. _ Businessman <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Vermaas </PERSON>, a friend of <PERSON> Pik </PERSON> <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> and other senior government officials, is under investigation for possible irregularities involving multimillion-dollar foreign exchange deals There are strict limits on the amount of money that can be taken out of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Vermaas </PERSON> allegedly was allowed to make huge transactions without having to receive approval from the <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. _ <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Beer </PERSON>, elected to <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> in 1987 in a closely contested race, was convicted last year of vote fraud De Beer has resigned from the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> but has maintained his seat in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> while he appeals. _ P.W <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> in December fired <PERSON> Amichand </PERSON> <PERSON> Rajbansi </PERSON>, the only Cabinet member of Indian descent, following investigations by two parliamentary committees and an inquiry commission. <PERSON> Rajbansi </PERSON> was accused of abusing his post in granting various contracts and licenses. Business Day, the country's leading financial daily, said in an editorial today that <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> `` has presided over the sleaziest administration <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> has known'' this century.

<TEXT>
 President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has met with <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> union leaders, including six scheduled for trial on racketeering charges, to thank them for their support in the election. The meeting was held Tuesday without announcement in the office of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>, chief of staff to the incoming president, according to <PERSON> Sheila </PERSON> <PERSON> Tate </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. Confirming an account of the meeting in today's editions of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>, Ms. <PERSON> Tate </PERSON> said: `` The Teamsters people were meeting with <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> and the president-elect simply stopped by briefly. The purpose was to thank them for their support during the election campaign.'' The Teamsters have supported the Republicans in the last three presidential elections, and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> appeared at the union's board meetings in the inaugural weeks in 1981 and in 1985 to express thanks for the endorsements of the Reagan-Bush ticket. Many members reportedly opposed the 1988 endorsement because of the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s success in winning the racketeering indictment. The department is seeking a federal trusteeship for the union in the trial scheduled to begin Feb. 27 in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The union's president, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, was strongly opposed to the Democratic candidate, Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>. Defendants in the case are <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> and 17 other members of the union's executive board. According to an unidentified aide quoted in the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> account, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` just stuck his head in the door'' in lieu of another public appearance at a board meeting, during a session of <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> leaders that lasted less than 20 minutes. <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> told the gathering that any discussion of the racketeering case or any other case `` would be inappropriate.''

 Attorneys want a federal judge to issue a gag order in the fraud trial of former <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>, who pleaded innocent to charges of diverting money donated by his television audience. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, asked for the order at the TV evangelist's arraignment Tuesday in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Magistrate <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> told <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> and a <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> prosecutor to draft a proposed consent order after <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> cited concerns over the comments of a retired federal bankruptcy judge who supervised the sale of <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> assets. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> noted that the bankruptcy judge, <PERSON> Rufus </PERSON> <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON>, had called the founder of the religious broadcasting empire a `` sawed-off little runt'' and `` a thief.'' `` We ca n't see how we can have a fair trial if we're innundated with pretrial negative publicity, especially from a federal judge,'' <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said. `` How can we prevent this?

The panel, headed by <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> Foreign Minister <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Sabah </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Sabah </PERSON>, was formed Thursday in <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION> at a meeting of Arab foreign ministers.

 Security for <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s inauguration as the nation's 41st president will be tight, with all law enforcement officers throughout the area on duty following cancellation of all days off. The 150,000 invited guests at the Capitol swearing-in ceremonies will be screened by metal detectors, even if they'll be sitting hundreds of yards away at the edge of the Capitol lawn. This is the first time those guests on the lawn will be screened so carefully, and Sen. <PERSON> Wendell </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>, D-Ky., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Inaugural Ceremonies, says he's upset about the tightened regimen `` Security is something that bothers me considerably,'' he said at a news conference Tuesday. `` We're a free and open nation insisting that those in the inner circle go through megadetectors.'' Anyone going to any of the galas or anywhere else that the first families might be will also be checked with the magnetometers. Demonstrations by those who want to see changes in the administration's policies are planned throughout the ceremonies. A corner of <LOCATION> Lafayette </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> across from the White House has been set aside `` to ensure First Amendment rights,'' in the words of Park Police Capt. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrett </PERSON>. But other protests will be held across the city. The Counter-Inaugural Coalition for a <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agenda </ORGANIZATION> has scheduled everything from a Union Station `` banquet'' _ a soup kitchen _ to a `` No Honeymoon'' benefit concert for the <ORGANIZATION> Christic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> featuring <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Crosby </PERSON> and <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> <PERSON> Nash </PERSON> at the Warner Theater. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION> plans to protest silently all along the <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> Avenue parade route. The manholes along <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Avenue </LOCATION> already have been welded shut, but many other details of the security measures remain secret. `` We certainly would n't want to give anyone who had harmful intent any kind of advantage,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON>. Reports on previous inaugurations have indicated that agents carrying shoulder-fired Stinger missiles to protect against air attack were on the Capitol roof. Will that be the case this year? No comment, say all the agencies involved. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Buckhorn </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, noted only that flying over the White House or the Capitol is a violation of federal air regulations. In past inaugurals, bullet-proof panels have protected the new president as he takes the oath of office and delivers his inaugural address. Workers at the Capitol's West Front were installing a bulletproof shield around the podium this week. Everybody willing to talk about it says <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will ride in an armored limousine as he travels from the Capitol to the White House following the oath-taking. But then, that's what they said about President <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> before he and his wife, <PERSON> Rosalynn </PERSON>, climbed out of their car and marched the 1 -LCB- miles down <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> Avenue in January 1977. <PERSON> Jody </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>, <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>'s press secretary, says <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> told him about his plans the week before the inauguration, but the news was `` very tightly held, for security purposes.'' `` What he told me at the time was the deal was the <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> was n't going to fight it as long as it was kept secret, but if word got out ahead of time, they'd be very opposed to it,'' <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> says his agency will be prepared to protect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> if he decides to stroll down <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> Avenue, but he admitted the service would not be too happy about it. `` If we had our way, he would not leave the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said. Law enforcement agencies involved in security for the inaugural ceremonies include the <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Capitol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION>, the local police department, <ORGANIZATION> Metro </ORGANIZATION> transit police, <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protective </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>. In addition, private security guards have been arranged for various parties. Approximately 8,500 military personnel will be involved in inaugural duties, including bands and other units marching in the parade, a cordon lining the parade route, and drivers for the first families and governors. The Capitol will be closed to all unauthorized people starting at 5 p.m. Thursday, the day before the ceremony, <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON> said. On Inauguration Day, all streets within a two-block radius of the Capitol will be closed. Even members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and their staffs wo n't be allowed to park on the lot on the building's east side. Security was in place a week in advance on the west side of the Capitol where risers have been built for several hundred VIPs who will sit behind <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as he faces the mall to deliver his speech, <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 Communist leaders passed a resolution early today that could restore Solidarity's legal status, but officials of the banned trade union movement said too many unacceptable conditions appeared to be attached. Among conditions set before today's vote by the party's governing <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> was that Solidarity declare itself in favor of socialism, promise no strikes for two years and forfeit financial assistance from the West. There was no immediate comment from Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>. An aide said he would hold a news conference Thursday. Prime Minister <PERSON> Mieczyslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> said during debate Tuesday he favored ending the seven-year ban on Solidarity if its leaders promised not to drag the economically depressed country `` into anarchy.'' The official <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> news agency said today a majority of the 230-member <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> had approved the party leadership's stand on trade union and political pluralism Other details of the proposal, debated 17 hours until 3 a.m., were not immediately available. The vote occurred too late to be included in morning newspapers and the text was not immediately carried by <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> also gave an overwhelming vote of confidence to top party authorities led by First Secretary <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> reported unanimous approval with four abstentions. A Solidarity source in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> said <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON>'s proposal to reinstate the only independent labor movement ever allowed in the Soviet bloc appeared at first glance unclear, `` unacceptable'' or even `` laughable.'' The source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said Solidarity could not function as a free trade union if forced to embrace an ideology and stripped of the right to strike. <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> said the government needed assurances that a legally functioning Solidarity would differ from the movement that used general strike threats as a pressure tactic during its 16-month heyday, which began in 1980. The organization was outlawed in 1982. Solidarity activists on Tuesday welcomed the shift in the party's stance but said they must proceed with caution, because authorities had acted out of necessity rather than good will `` The authorities will do whatever that have to do to stay on top. Let's wait and see what they have to say and read the fine print carefully,'' said <PERSON> Maciej </PERSON> <PERSON> Jankowski </PERSON>, a Solidarity leader at <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> crushed Solidarity in a December 1981 military crackdown, interning thousands of activists and banning the movement the next year. After a series of spring and summer strikes demanding higher pay and Solidarity's reinstatement, <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> agreed to resume contacts with the movement. However, promised negotiations with the opposition were repeatedly delayed over conditions set by both sides. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> has warned that the public mood is reaching the boiling point because of rising prices and annoying consumer shortages. In the latest sign of tension, a strike for higher pay and legalization of Solidarity on Tuesday shut down the 1,100-worker Pabianice Fabric Works in the textile city of <LOCATION> Lodz </LOCATION>. Under the proposal <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> put to the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, final legalization of Solidarity would follow a two-year probationary period lasting until May 3, 1991, the 200th anniversary of the adoption of a progressive constitution that Imperial <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION> quickly invalidated by force. `` We have to gain certainty that this Solidarity, which can not be a simple repetition of the old one, does not pull the country into anarchy,'' <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> addressed specific questions to Solidarity in his speech, saying the answers would determine if the union could be a partner, or whether it would remain a `` political opponent.'' He asked what position Solidarity would take toward anti-communist Polish groups like the Confederation for an Independent <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, and whether it would continue to take money from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and other foreign organizations. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government has granted Solidarity $ 1 million a year the last two years, but Polish authorities have held up spending of half of this. Total <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid to Solidarity was estimated last year at $ 5 million by <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>. Solidarity does not deny receiving foreign help. <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> said he would take money from the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> if he could use it to defend trade union freedoms. <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> stressed that the economy would be the most important factor for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> during the next few years. `` It above all needs order and peace,'' he said. `` Even the best administration methods and solutions will not meet our hopes if the ... economy becomes a field of political struggles.''

<HEAD>Clumsy Robber Drops Loot, Passersby Return It To Bank</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FONTANA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 As might have been expected, when a bumbling bank robber dropped his loot on the street a crowd quickly gathered to grab what was blowing in the wind. What might not have been expected was that the bystanders returned almost all the money to the bank. `` I think it's wonderful when citizens are willing to step in and help,'' police Sgt. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Castellini </PERSON> said of Tuesday's incident. `` I'm not sure there's anything pleasant about a robbery ... but when you see something positive happen, you ca n't help but have a smile on your face. All but $ 20 of the $ 2,900 taken from <ORGANIZATION> Redlands </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> was returned, <PERSON> Castellini </PERSON> said. He said the missing $ 20 bill probably blew away before anyone could grab it. Police said the incident began at 9:48 a.m. when a man walked into the bank and handed a teller a bag and a note demanding money. After receiving the filled bag, the man fled, but dropped the bag almost as soon as he got outside. Rather than stop to retrieve it, he kept on running, leaving the money to scatter in the wind. The robber escaped in the commotion, <PERSON> Castellini </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Psychiatrists: Confessed TWA Hijacker Mentally Competent for Trial</HEAD>

<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Psychiatric experts said today that confessed hijacker <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> is mentally competent to stand trial, despite head wounds he received during fighting in his native <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> is charged with air piracy and murder in the June 14, 1985 hijacking of a <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> jetliner in which <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> diver <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON> was slain. <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> admitted taking part in the hijacking but denied killing <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON>. Following the seizure of the Athens-to-Rome flight, 39 Americans were held hostage for 17 days. The <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> court, acting on a defense request in November, ordered psychiatric tests for <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> after it was revealed in court testimony that he had received head wounds in fighting in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, where a civil war has raged for 13 years. <PERSON> Willi </PERSON> <PERSON> Schumacher </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hasso </PERSON> <PERSON> Sachs </PERSON>, professors of psychiatry at <ORGANIZATION> Giessen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, 35 miles north of <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>, testified today on the results of their tests of <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>. <PERSON> Schumacher </PERSON> said <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>'s mental processes `` are quick, coherent, and concise.'' His head has some scars, but `` none of them is sensitive to outside pressure,'' <PERSON> Schumacher </PERSON> said. He said the defendant's reflexes were normal and that <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> had no coordination problems. `` Mr. <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> is in all respects mentally fit,'' <PERSON> Schumacher </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Sachs </PERSON> said he tested <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> for mental disturbances, intellectual development and concentration. He described the defendant as `` orderly thinking, and stable.'' `` He was friendly, courteous, cooperative, absolutely not withdrawn,'' <PERSON> Sachs </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Sachs </PERSON> said his tests showed <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> was of average intelligence and that `` cerebal damage could not be established, indicating a fully healthy brain.'' Following the psychiatrists' testimony, the defense asked that <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> be given additional tests. Chief Judge <PERSON> Heiner </PERSON> <PERSON> Mueckenberger </PERSON> did not immediately rule on the request. The trial, which began July 5, resumed this week after a break of nearly one month. <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> has been kept in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>'s Preungesheim prison since his arrest at the city's airport Jan. 23, 1987. He was arrested after being caught with liquid explosives in his luggage. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> requested his extradition, but following the kidnapping of two West Germans in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> said he would be tried here instead. <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>'s brother, <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>, was sentenced by a <LOCATION> Duesseldorf </LOCATION> court in April to 13 years in prison for his part in kidnapping the West Germans, allegedly to win <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON>'s freedom. The two West Germans have since been freed.

<HEAD>Oil Imports Highest Since 1979, API Reports</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> oil imports last year jumped to the highest level since 1979 as consumption rose and domestic production hit a 12-year low, an industry trade group said today. The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, representing the major oil producers and refiners, said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> oil production fell to 8.1 million barrels a day, a nearly 3 percent drop from 1987. The rate was the lowest since 1976, the year before production began at the giant <LOCATION> Prudhoe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> oil field on the North Slope of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>. Oil production in the 48 contiguous states last year was the lowest since 1950, the group said. Imports of oil surged to a rate of 7.2 million barrels a day, a nearly 9 percent increase over 1987. The record peak for oil imports was 8.8 million barrels a day in 1977, two years before the Iranian revolution sparked the secon oil crisis of the decade. The rise in imports and drop in domestic production highlight what the independent, mostly smaller, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> oil producers say is an urgent need for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to adopt some form of legislation to protect the industry from cheap foreign oil. One proposal likely to face the new <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is a fee on imported oil, which proponents say would curb the trend toward higher imports and lower domestic output. The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> has not taken an official position on this issue. The institute's latest report said total <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> energy use last year rose to the highest level ever, to 80 quads, a standard measure of energy consumption that is equal to a quadrillion British thermal units. One Btu is defined as the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of one pound of water by one degree Fahrenheit. Despite the rise in overall energy use, oil's share of total consumption continued to decline, to 42 percent, compared with 43 percent in 1987 and 49 percent in 1977. Use of electricity, coal and natural gas all rose by about 5 percent last year, the report said. Gasoline consumption continued an upward trend last year, but at a slower rate than in recent years. Use rose 1.6 percent in 1988, which the trade organization attributed in part to a general decline in retail gasoline prices in recent years. Consumption had risen 2.4 percent in 1987 and 3 percent the year before.

<HEAD>Two Maryland Men Arrested in 1979 Deaths of Elderly Pair</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 After nearly 10 years of dead-ends, police have arrested two men for killing an elderly sister and brother who died of thirst and hunger after being left trussed in their home in 1979. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Askew </PERSON>, 51, of Princess <PERSON> Anne </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON>, 40, of <LOCATION> Finksburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, have been charged with homicide in the case, <LOCATION> Lancaster </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Assistant District Attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kenneff </PERSON> said Tuesday. The two suspects allegedly bound and gagged <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> and <PERSON> Horace </PERSON> <PERSON> Swarr </PERSON> and robbed their home of an undetermined quantity of coins and currency on or about Sept. 10, 1979. Someone _ apparently one of the robbers _ later called police and reported that an elderly couple had been tied up and robbed at 442 E. Walnut St. The Swarrs lived at 432 <ORGANIZATION> W. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Walnut </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> found the trussed couple seven days later after a newspaper carrier reported seeing a large number of newspapers on the doorstep of the Swarr home. By the time they were discovered, <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Swarr </PERSON>, 57, was dead. Her 81-year-old brother died the following day. According to criminal complaints released Tuesday, both died of dehydration and malnutrition. At a news conference Tuesday night, authorities said the perplexing case was finally broken through a 1987 tip from <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> police that led to an extended investigation of the two suspects, who were arrested Saturday. Two others suspects are under investigation in the case, authorities said, but their identities were not released. <PERSON> Askew </PERSON> waived extradition Tuesday and should be returned to <LOCATION> Lancaster </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> within seven days, <PERSON> Kenneff </PERSON> said. <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON>'s extradition hearing began Tuesday and was scheduled to today in <LOCATION> Carroll </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, Md

<TEXT>
 Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> was shouted off the podium in Parliament today by left-wing legislators when he tried to defend tougher tactics for putting down the Palestinian uprising. Right-wing critics of the government said it was not doing enough to end the revolt against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s 21-year occupation of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. The army closed Palestinian schools in four <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> cities for three days and three others for 10 days. The closures were aimed at stopping the violence that has taken the lives of at least 13 teen-agers in the past week, the army said. In violence today, two <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> teen-agers were wounded in a clash with troops in <LOCATION> Hebron </LOCATION> in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> news reports said. An Israeli driver and a Palestinian passenger suffered minor injuries when a firebomb was thrown at a bus near the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio reported. <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> came under fire in the legislature for his latest policy of allowing troops to shoot plastic or rubber bullets at stone-throwers even as they flee, and for expanding the number of troops allowed to shoot. Plastic and rubber bullets were introduced as a less lethal method of quelling riots than live ammunition, but they have been blamed for several deaths, including eight of the teen-agers killed in the past week. Three deaths Tuesday brought the number of Palestinians killed in the 13-month uprising to 362. Fifteen Israelis have died. Another part of the new policy calls for punishing stone-throwers by wrecking or sealing their homes or confiscating their families' property `` As long as the residents of the -LRB- occupied -RRB- territories are n't ready to sit down at the negotiating table, as long as they respond with violence, rocks and bottles, they will not make us run away, they will not make us surrender They will suffer,'' <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> said. Hecklers interrupted him at least a dozen times before he stopped speaking and angrily took his seat. Some critics called for his resignation. One detractor, <PERSON> Yossi </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarid </PERSON> of the left-wing <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>, said: `` This policy is not only killing Palestinians but also the souls of <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers. I say to you that for the sake of our future and our common destiny, ours and the Palestinians ... I say to you Mr. Defense Minister, go.'' The debate followed the introduction of no-confidence motions by eight factions against the government's handling of the latest violence. <PERSON> Rehavam </PERSON> <PERSON> Zeevi </PERSON> of the ultra-nationalist <ORGANIZATION> Homeland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which seeks the expulsion of Arabs from <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the occupied lands, represented one of three parties that criticized <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> for not going far enough. `` Children and teen-agers are running wild in the villages and on the roads ... For them it's a festival. For us, a continuous Yom Kippur,'' the Jewish Day of Atonement, <PERSON> Zeevi </PERSON> said. `` There is no justification for this.'' The Cabinet, which includes the right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc and the left-leaning <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, was expected to easily defeat the no-confidence motions from the small parties. Also today, police fired rubber bullets to quell one disturbance at a high school in Arab east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> and detained eight demonstrators, police spokesman <PERSON> Rafi </PERSON> <PERSON> Levy </PERSON> said. An army statement said most of the school closures were meant to prevent further violence and thwart student plans to stage strikes `` for reasons that have nothing to do with education, such as house demolitions.'' In line with the new army policy, soldiers Tuesday dynamited three homes of Palestinians in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Qalqiliya </LOCATION>. Palestinian merchants closed their shops and public transportation came to a halt in <LOCATION> Jenin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Qalqilya </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> in protest of the latest demolitions and the rash of deaths, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said.

An attachment to the report shows more than 600 contacts between <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> and the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> lawyer from the time the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration came to power. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s assistance to scandal-plagued <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in 1981 and 1983 and his efforts on behalf of a proposed <LOCATION> Mideast </LOCATION> oil pipeline in 1985 were three instances in which his friendship with <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> `` dictated'' federal actions, said the report by the department's Office of Professional Responsibility <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>, who collected $ 1.3 million from <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> from 1982 to 1986, is awaiting trial in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> on racketeering and other charges. He is accused of peddling his connection to <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>. White House spokesmen <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> believes that <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, his longtime friend, had done nothing wrong. And he said `` this report was unnecessary, partly because Mr. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> has not been in the office for some time and partly because it was unwarranted.'' Then-Deputy Attorney General <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> and criminal division chief <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> `` recognized the impropriety of Mr. <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>'s activities and advised Mr. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> to repudiate them,'' said the report, but <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> continued to meet with <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> and receive letters and memos from him as he had since 1981 <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> and <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> resigned last March to protest <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s continued tenure at the department while he was under criminal investigation. `` Despite the ability of others to perceive potential problems with Mr. <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>'s actions, Mr. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> remained blind to them and made no effort to distance himself from Mr. <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>,'' the ethics report concluded. It said that other people who were n't even close to <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> `` could recognize problems with Mr. <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>'s actions'' and that `` certainly Mr. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s internal warning bell should have gone off.'' The report is especially critical of <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s actions in connection with the oil pipeline, in which <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> arranged a meeting between then-national security adviser <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON>, <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> and <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>'s client, Swiss oilman <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Rappaport </PERSON>. At the time, <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> was liable for legal fees to <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>, who had represented him in a criminal investigation in 1984. `` Mr. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> knew when he became involved in the pipeline matter that Mr. <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> had a financial interest in the project and that he was potentially liable to Mr. <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>'' for more than $ 142,000 in legal fees, said the report. `` Despite this knowledge, Mr. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> acceded to Mr. <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>'s request that he call Mr. <PERSON> McFarlane </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>'s fees eventually were paid by the government. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Korten </PERSON> complained that the report had an `` emotional undertone'' about <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> that was designed `` to slam him personally.'' <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, an attorney for <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> and <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> both had acted properly and called the department's report `` old news.'' <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> said <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> simply asked <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> to ensure that <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> was being treated fairly in connection with a $ 32 million Army engine contract and that <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> `` did n't participate'' in resolving a 1983 problem involving financing for the company. <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> eventually was awarded the no-bid contract. <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> said in regard to the more than 600 contacts between <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> and <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> that `` <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> put all this in writing. We know there's nothing wrong.'' But the <ORGANIZATION> OPR </ORGANIZATION> report said that many letters and memos contain a `` strong undercurrent'' in which <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> is `` seeking action'' from <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> and his staff on matters in which <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> had a financial interest. `` Mr. <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> traded on his ability to invoke Mr. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s authority to facilitate achieving the ends he sought,'' the report said `` Mr. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, it appears, was, at best, oblivious to Mr. <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>'s method of operation.'' <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s successor as attorney general, <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>, tried to avoid characterizing the <ORGANIZATION> OPR </ORGANIZATION> report in any way, but ultimately disagreed with one of its conclusions while saying the others were adequately based on facts. He said the report is a `` roadmap'' on how to respond to certain types of situations. <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> disagreed with one conclusion that said <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> violated ethical standards when he failed to sell $ 14,000 in stock of regional telephone companies while participating in department decisions affecting them. Independent counsel <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> decided last summer not to prosecute <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>, although <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> concluded <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> had probably twice violated conflict-of-interest laws in connection with his telephone holdings and had violated tax laws in connection with failing to report the stock sales. The <ORGANIZATION> OPR </ORGANIZATION> investigation involved ethical rather than criminal aspects of <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s actions.

 A 10-year-old boy arrested for selling cocaine was led away in tears and in handcuffs to a children's shelter, where he was ordered held because he failed to appear in court on two previous arrest warrants During a 30-minute hearing Tuesday, <ORGANIZATION> Suffolk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Family </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Auperin </PERSON> ordered the boy detained despite his mother's assurances that she would make sure he showed up at the next hearing, scheduled for Friday The mother also had been subpoenaed at the boy's two previous court dates. The child, believed to be the youngest suspect ever arrested on <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> on drug selling charges, remained silent and showed no emotion until he apparently realized he would not be released. Then he began to cry. His mother left the courtroom sobbing after watching her son, wearing sneakers and blue jeans with a rolled-up comic book in his back pocket, being led away. He was taken to the <LOCATION> Nassau </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Children </LOCATION>'s Shelter in <LOCATION> Westbury </LOCATION>. The boy's attorney entered an innocent plea on the youth's behalf. A 14-year-old accomplice, arrested with the 10-year-old, was released in his mother's custody after his attorney argued that the boy posed no danger to society. Both youths were arrested Sunday after police saw them allegedly dealing crack cocaine on a streetcorner. As the youths tried to flee on a bike, the 10-year-old dropped a bag containing three $ 20 crack vials. One of the youths also had $ 226 in cash in his pocket, police said. <LOCATION> Suffolk </LOCATION> police are seeking a man who is believed to have hired the boys to sell the drugs for him.

 Police broke into a church early today and dragged away a Sri Lankan who had taken refuge there and was sleeping handcuffed to a radiator, his supporters said. Home Office Minister <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Renton </PERSON> said <PERSON> Viraj </PERSON> <PERSON> Mendis </PERSON>, 32, would be sent back to <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> if he did not find another country to accept him by Friday. <PERSON> Mendis </PERSON> says he faces persecution and possible death in his native country because of his communist beliefs and support for the Tamil minority. The British government and courts disagree. The Rev. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Methuen </PERSON> of the Church of the Ascension said police arrived at his home about 7:30 a.m. and broke down the door leading to the vestry where <PERSON> Mendis </PERSON> was staying with two supporters. <PERSON> Methuen </PERSON> said there was `` quite a lot'' of damage done to the building. A Home Office spokesman confirmed that two immigration officers and 50 police officers forced their way into the Church of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> premises in northern <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. `` The door into the sacristy -LRB- or vestry -RRB- was a large wooden door which was heavily bolted and barred,'' said <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Platt </PERSON>, head of the Immigration and Nationality section at the Home Office. `` They forced that door with special equipment which had the result of doing some damage to the door and wall.'' <PERSON> Ingrid </PERSON> <PERSON> Falat </PERSON>, a member of the church council, said <PERSON> Mendis </PERSON> was `` handcuffed to the radiator in the room ... they dragged him out by his hands and feet.'' Falat and other witnesses said the police used acetylene torches to remove the handcuffs. <PERSON> Mendis </PERSON> has lost two immigration appeals, a High Court judicial review and a <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeal </ORGANIZATION> review of a deportation order issued in December 1986. Last month, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s highest court, the Law Lords of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lords </ORGANIZATION>, also refused to hear his case. <PERSON> Mendis </PERSON> took refuge in the church Dec. 20, 1986, two days after Home Secretary <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurd </PERSON>, the senior <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> minister responsible for immigration, signed the deportation order against him for `` overstaying'' in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mendis </PERSON> was trying to revive the ancient right of sanctuary, which dates back to the Old Testament and had a long tradition in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> until it was abolished by <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> in 1623. The medieval sanctuary at <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Westminster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Abbey </ORGANIZATION> harbored so many people it was said to resemble a small town. <PERSON> Mendis </PERSON> came to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> in 1973 on a student visa to study at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manchester </ORGANIZATION>. He ran into financial difficulties after two years, dropped out, went to work and joined a communist splinter group. <PERSON> Mendis </PERSON> is a member of <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s Sinhalese majority but has actively supported the rights of the Tamil minority. Tamil rebels are fighting for an independent homeland in <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>. `` The Sri Lankan government have, in the past, given assurances that he is not wanted in <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> for any offense and is free to go there without impediment,'' <PERSON> Renton </PERSON> said in a statement. `` We have always felt that the situation in <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> did not justify the position that <PERSON> Mendis </PERSON> and his supporters were adopting.''

 Rioters set fires and looted stores early today as 700 police officers poured into two black neighborhoods, arresting hundreds in an attempt to halt two days of racial violence in which two people have died. The violence eased toward dawn, enabling police to reduce their presence. The riots, which began Monday night in the <LOCATION> Overtown </LOCATION> section following the shooting death of a black motoryclist by a police officer there, spread to the <LOCATION> Liberty </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> neighborhood Tuesday. The violence, which broke out as <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> made final preparations for Sunday's Super Bowl, forced the cancellation of a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Basketball </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> game Tuesday night. `` Things have quieted a lot since about 2 a.m.,'' said police spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivero </PERSON>. `` We have pulled back some of the blockades.'' <PERSON> Rivero </PERSON> said some sections of <LOCATION> Overtown </LOCATION>'s business district were still closed to traffic at 6:30 a.m., but most roads were open in the mostly residential <LOCATION> Liberty </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> area. Two fires were burning in <LOCATION> Liberty </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> at dawn, including a church that was being allowed to burn to the ground, <PERSON> Rivero </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> began an investigation of the cyclist's shooting, which led to the death of the man's passenger after the motorcyle crashed. The city also was investigating the shooting; the <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> convened for an emergency session today. `` For the sake of our city, I appeal to every citizen, regardless of race to stay calm, get off the streets and stay in your homes,'' said Mayor <PERSON> Xavier </PERSON> <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON> in a televised appeal Tuesday night. Police, who earlier had stood by to protect lives and property, took a more assertive role late Tuesday, arresting troublemakers. By early today, 250 arrests had been made, mostly for burglaries, said police Sgt. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazur </PERSON>. The suspects were being held at the <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jail </LOCATION> pending bail hearings, according to a jail spokeswoman who would not give her name. The 1 -LCB- square mile <LOCATION> Overtown </LOCATION> section and a small part of <LOCATION> Liberty </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> were cordoned off by police. The decision to sweep through the areas and make arrests came after sniping incidents increased, police said. In <LOCATION> Liberty </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, northwest of <LOCATION> Overtown </LOCATION>, a 16-year-old black youth was killed late Tuesday in a shooting apparently unrelated to the rioting. Metro-Dade police Sgt. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Roper </PERSON> said <PERSON> Troy </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> was shot to death during an argument over a stolen check-printing marchine. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Scippio </PERSON>, 37, of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, was arrested and charged with first-degree murder. In <LOCATION> Overtown </LOCATION>, just north of downtown, two people were shot Tuesday, one of them in the leg by police. Five others were shot in <LOCATION> Liberty </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, including a police officer who was wearing a bulletproof vest and was not seriously injured by sniper fire. A white man in a luxury car fired a gun into a crowd of rock-throwing blacks early Tuesday afternoon, wounding a 19-year-old man who was hospitalized in fair condition. Gunfire and rock-throwing in the area of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arena </LOCATION>, which is in <LOCATION> Overtown </LOCATION>, forced the postponement of Tuesday night's <ORGANIZATION> NBA </ORGANIZATION> game between the <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heat </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Phoenix </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Suns </ORGANIZATION>. A meat truck, furniture stores and several smaller stores were looted, <PERSON> Mazur </PERSON> said. The Liberty City community center was set ablaze as were at least a half dozen other buildings. A white motorist whose car broke down was beaten but managed to run toward police for protection, and an <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> photographer was roughed up by a mob and his car torched. `` I saw someone coming around a building and throwing rocks, and I said ` Let's go, get out of here,''' said photographer <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Pesetsky </PERSON>, who escaped after police fired tear gas at the crowd. At least two other beatings were reported, and several people were treated for lacerations, <ORGANIZATION> Jackson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> officials said. Police worked 17-hour shifts and ran out of riot bags, equipped with a gas mask, shield, baton, helmet and handcuffs. Weary officers arrived at <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> police headquarters downtown, hoping for a respite in the violence. Most Miamians remained unaffected by the rioting, which was confined to a relatively small portion of the central city. The closest many got to the riot scene was on Interstate 95, which passes over the western edge of <LOCATION> Overtown </LOCATION>, or on the Dolphin Expressway, which intersects I-95 near the troubled area. Motorists could see and smell smoke from fires set by rioters and there were isolated incidents of rocks and bottles being thrown at cars. The violence erupted following the shooting death of 23-year-old <PERSON> Clement </PERSON> <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> during a police pursuit. A passenger on the motorcycle, <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON>, 24, died Tuesday. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> was shot in the head by Officer <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON>, a four-year police veteran who was investigating an unrelated incident when <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> sped by, authorities said. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> and <PERSON> Blanchard </PERSON> were unarmed and were being pursued for a speeding violation, said police spokesman <PERSON> Angelo </PERSON> <PERSON> Bitsis </PERSON>. Within hours, a mob of blacks surrounded the crash scene and began throwing rocks and bottles. <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON>, 29, a Colombian immigrant who had been on the squad for three years, was automatically suspended with pay pending an investigation. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> ordered the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> to investigate the shooting. <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON> also promised an investigation and said he would name an independent review panel of private citizens, who could meet as early as today. `` We will not rest until we come to the bottom of what happened to spark this riot,'' <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON> added. School officials said six <LOCATION> Overtown </LOCATION> schools closed after the first night of riots would reopen today. <LOCATION> Overtown </LOCATION> is about 15 miles from <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Robbie </PERSON> <PERSON> Stadium </PERSON>, site of the Super Bowl. The <ORGANIZATION> Cincinnati </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bengals </ORGANIZATION>, who play the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> 49ers in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Football </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> championship game, are staying less than a mile from <LOCATION> Overtown </LOCATION>, at the Omni Hotel. Some community leaders blamed the violence on what is perceived in the black community as favoritism toward Hispanic refugees. `` In this tremendous influx of refugees from Central and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, the African-Americans have felt cheated. We felt we were losing our place in the city,'' said <PERSON> Johnnie </PERSON> <PERSON> McMillian </PERSON>, president of the <LOCATION> Miami-Dade </LOCATION> branch of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> for the Advancement of Colored People. The violence recalled bloody riots in <LOCATION> Liberty </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> in 1980 and <LOCATION> Overtown </LOCATION> in 1982 following incidents in which black men were shot to death by police.

<HEAD>Cosmonauts Show No Great Effects of Year in Space</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Two cosmonauts who spent a year in space suffered fewer physical effects than expected, and there do not appear to be any barriers to even longer missions, <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> space specialists said today. `` Longer flights, we believe, are quite possible, and we think they will be carried out,'' <PERSON> Anatoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Grigoryev </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bio-Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Problems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, told a news conference. <PERSON> Grigoryev </PERSON> said cosmonauts <PERSON> Musa </PERSON> <PERSON> Manarov </PERSON> and <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Titov </PERSON>, who returned to <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> on Dec. 21 after a year in space, suffered some atrophy of their calf muscles and some loss of calcium, as have other cosmonauts. But because of exercise and training developed by Soviet scientists, the effects suffered by <PERSON> Manarov </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tito </PERSON> were less severe than their predecessors', he said. <PERSON> Titov </PERSON>, <PERSON> Manarov </PERSON> and French cosmonaut <PERSON> Jean-Loup </PERSON> <PERSON> Chretien </PERSON> also attended the news conference. <PERSON> Chretien </PERSON> spent a month on the Mir orbiting space complex before returning with <PERSON> Titov </PERSON> and <PERSON> Manarov </PERSON>, who hold the space endurance record. <PERSON> Titov </PERSON> said he and <PERSON> Manarov </PERSON> noticed some atrophy of their leg muscles in the weightless conditions aboard the Mir complex. He said he had been afraid about the effects of the long period of weightlessness when he returned to <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>, `` but our ideas were bleaker than reality. We feel quite well, better than expected.'' Scientists said results of tests done on <PERSON> Titov </PERSON> and <PERSON> Manarov </PERSON> still are being analyzed. In response to a reporter's question, <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunayev </PERSON>, head of the Glavkosmos space agency, said Soviet officials still had not decided whether the second flight of the space shuttle Buran will be manned or unmanned. He said technological and economic disagreements about Buran's next flight had not been settled and that a date for the second flight was not set Glavkosmos is the space agency charged with development of space engineering for the economy. Buran was launched Nov. 15 on a three-hour, 20 minute unmanned flight. But the Soviet press has referred several times to an internal debate about the shuttle program. Soviet space officials for years scorned the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> shuttle program as inefficient before unveiling a similar-looking craft.

<HEAD>Thieves Kill Armored Car Guard In Failed Robbery Attempt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRESCIA, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Bandits shot and killed a security guard in a botched attack on an armored car, police said today. Eight or nine masked gunmen fired a hail of machine-gun rounds to stop the armored car Tuesday night at a railroad crossing near this northern town, according to police. <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Bozzi </PERSON>, 37, a guard riding in the rear of the car, was struck in the head and killed by at least one of the bullets, which police said had probably been intended as warning shots. Two guards in the front got out of the car and the bandits grabbed what police described as a `` modest'' amount of money. They said the bandits fired their weapons at the back of the car in an attempt to break open the back door, but they could n't get the door open and fled. The Italian news agency <ORGANIZATION> ANSA </ORGANIZATION> reported the gunmen were believed to be those responsible for a Nov. 9 robbery in <LOCATION> Bergamo </LOCATION>, about 30 miles away. In that attack, gunmen engaged in a shootout with guards before fleeing with $ 425,000.

 A study at a <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> hospital serving inner-city residents found that nearly one in five expectant mothers used cocaine, sparking concern among doctors who reported an increase in addicted newborns. `` It's very alarming,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Zuckerman </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>. `` Cocaine is not only bad during pregnancy, but being a cocaine abuser is not a great way for a child to be reared.'' <PERSON> Zuckerman </PERSON>, of the hospital's Division of Development Behavioral Pediatrics, conducted the study of 1,226 pregnant woman, most of whom were from the inner city. The study found that 18 percent had used cocaine at least once during pregnancy, the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> reported today. Nearly a quarter of those who admitted using cocaine said they took the drug three or more times a week. <PERSON> Zuckerman </PERSON> said he expects to complete the study in six months. He is analyzing the data to determine the impact of cocaine use on developing fetuses. `` We were actually studying the effects of marijuana during pregnancy, but it became clear cocaine was used more frequently, so we looked at the effects of cocaine,'' he said. A study released last summer by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Perinatal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Addiction </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> showed that at least 11 percent of women in 36 hospitals had used illegal drugs during pregnancy. The hospitals were chosen to represent a range of socio-economic levels among patients.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said today the request of newspaper heiress <PERSON> Patty </PERSON> <PERSON> Hearst </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON> for a pardon has not come to his desk for attention, and an administration official cautioned against expecting any `` too extraordinary'' pardons during <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s final days in office. `` There are always pardons coming across my desk from the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told reporters. Asked specifically about Mrs. <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON>, convicted for her role in a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> bank robbery 14 years ago, the president said, `` No, that has n't come to my desk for attention yet.'' White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, `` There are pardons that are in the system, but I do n't have any status report on whether or not he has had a chance to review them.'' A senior official, speaking on condition he not be identified, said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has pardoned 10 people in the last few weeks through the normal process, in which they are announced by the courts rather than the White House. `` My private guidance is not to expect anything too extraordinary here in the form of pardons,'' the official said. He added, however, that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has not made final decisions and `` I can never preempt the president.'' The official said former national security aide <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>, Mrs. <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON> and industrialist <PERSON> Armand </PERSON> <PERSON> Hammer </PERSON> were in the category of potential pardon recipients he had in mind as `` extraordinary.'' With time running out on his two-term presidency, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has `` as many as a couple of dozen'' requests still pending, said the source who declined to be publicly identified. Mrs. <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON>, 34, said earlier this week that she did not know if <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s expression of interest in her case means she stands a good chance of being pardoned. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has been reluctant to discuss the subject of pardons, although he did tell reporters Sunday that `` I have asked everybody to look into'' the Shaw case. He has repeatedly said he plans no pardon for <PERSON> North </PERSON>, who faces a trial on an array of charges related to the Iran-Contra affair. The administration source would not divulge the names of the 10 pardon requests that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> reviewed and referred back to the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. `` There are no big names,'' he said. Spokesman <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> had told reporters Tuesday, `` It's certainly possible that a decision could be made -LRB- on <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON> -RRB- before he leaves.'' <PERSON> Patty </PERSON> <PERSON> Hearst </PERSON> was sentenced to seven years in a federal prison for her role in the 1974 armed robbery of a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> bank. She now is married and living in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> with her husband and two daughters under the married name of <PERSON> Patty </PERSON> <PERSON> Hearst </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Shaw </ORGANIZATION>, granddaughter of newspaper tycoon <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Randolph </PERSON> <PERSON> Hearst </PERSON>, last August quietly asked for a pardon for her role in the robbery. She has maintained she was brainwashed by the radical <ORGANIZATION> Symbionese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, a group of revolutionaries who kidnapped her in <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, in February 1974 and orchestrated the bank heist. Her seven-year sentence was commuted by President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> and she was released from prison on Feb. 1, 1979, after serving 23 months. In an interview Monday with The Advocate of <LOCATION> Stamford </LOCATION> at her <LOCATION> Westport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, home, <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON> said, `` It's a little premature for anything like that. If he -LRB- <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> -RRB- does n't approve it, it would go to the next administration.'' Attention also is being given to a longstanding pardon request by Hammer, the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> industrialist and head of <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. He was fined $ 3,000 and placed on a year's probation in connection with his guilty plea to three misdemeanor charges in connection with the Watergate scandal of the early 1970s. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said that he would not `` comment on any individuals that are in this category. Some of them are recent. Some of them, we've had for weeks or for months.'' The administration official who spoke on the condition of anonymity said that the pardon approvals `` tend to trickle over. ... We got 10 back from the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, approved, last week.'' Under routine procedure, the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s pardons office would contact the person receiving a pardon or that person's attorney, he said

 Federal racketeering charges were filed against 18 former employees of a now defunct commodities brokerage firm accused of defrauding 2,600 investors out of about $ 40 million. The charges, announced Tuesday, grew out of the largest investigation of its kind ever undertaken by the federal government, according to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Anton </PERSON> <PERSON> Valukas </PERSON>. The 18 former <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> area employees of <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, all named in an indictment returned by a federal grand jury and in a criminal information, were charged with 187 counts of racketeering, racketeering conspiracy, wire and mail fraud, <PERSON> Valukas </PERSON> said. The company's former national vice president for sales, two branch managers and 15 former salesmen from its <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and suburban <LOCATION> Oak </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brook </LOCATION> offices were accused of using high-pressure tactics to persuade customers around the country to invest in high-stakes commodity ventures misrepresented as low-risk. <PERSON> Valukas </PERSON> said customers were solicited by <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> sales representatives posing as commodities experts. The representatives often made repeated phone calls using `` scripts'' handed out by managers, he said. Investors were falsely told that `` commodity trading was not risky ... and would lead to high profits,'' the prosecutor said. `` In fact ... the defendants knew almost all of <ORGANIZATION> FCCB </ORGANIZATION>'s customers lost money.'' During the time covered by the charges, from 1980 to February 1987, the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Oak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brook </ORGANIZATION> offices had $ 100 million in sales, of which $ 63 million was lost, <PERSON> Valukas </PERSON> said. More than $ 40.6 million of those sales and more than $ 22.7 million of the losses were attributable to the former employees named in the complaints, <PERSON> Valukas </PERSON> said. He declined to say whether more charges were forthcoming, but noted that the investigation is continuing in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Michele </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said the probe was the largest of its type in several aspects, including the number of victims _ 2,600 named in Tuesday's charges as well as 44,400 other customers of the firm during the period of the alleged scheme. `` Allegations are that the entire company was operated under fraud,'' she said today. The $ 600 million raised by <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> from 1980 to the firm's collapse in February 1987 is alleged to have been fraudulently generated and is the largest sum involved in an alleged commodities fraud scheme, she said. More than 500 <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents _ the most ever in such a case _ have been involved in the probe, Ms. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. In November, three former salesmen for the company pleaded guilty in the investigation and agreed to cooperate with federal agents. First Commodity was founded in the late 1970s, and rapidly grew into one of the nation's leading futures trading companies. But it collapsed in 1987 under a mountain of investor lawsuits and federal investigations. The newest defendants include <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Connolly </PERSON>, 48, of <LOCATION> Teaneck </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION>'s former national sales vice president; former <ORGANIZATION> Oak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brook </ORGANIZATION> branch manager <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnard </PERSON>, 37 of suburban <LOCATION> Hinsdale </LOCATION>; and <PERSON> Barnard </PERSON>'s brother, <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnard </PERSON>, 38, of suburban <LOCATION> Flossmoor </LOCATION>, former house broker at the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> office. Neither <PERSON> Connolly </PERSON> nor the <ORGANIZATION> Barnards </ORGANIZATION> could be reached for comment. The Barnards had unpublished numbers and <PERSON> Connolly </PERSON> was not listed in the <LOCATION> Teaneck </LOCATION> area. If convicted, the defendants could face lengthy prison terms and thousands of dollars in fines. `` It is a sad reality that sophisticated and deceptive sales techniques can yield great profits to those willing to use them,'' <PERSON> Valukas </PERSON> said. `` These cases should serve as a clear warning that fraud and deception in the offer and sale of commodity contracts _ in whatever form it takes _ will be thoroughly investigated and vigorously prosecuted.''

 Former <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> president <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> is dying and should not face trial on charges he stole millions of dollars from his country's treasury, his lawyers said today. Attorney <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hibey </PERSON> asserted that <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> was mortally ill after prosecutors dropped their demand that <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> come to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> for arraignment and asked instead that he be arraigned in <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>. They acknowledged that his recent hospitalization for pneumonia would delay any travel for more than a month. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, 71, who has been living in exile in <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> since 1986, is hospitalized there with pneumonia, bronchitis and asthma, according to Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> LaBella </PERSON>. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, his wife, <PERSON> Imelda </PERSON>, 59, are accused of plundering $ 103 million from the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> treasury, funneling it to foreign bank accounts and using it to buy prime <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> real estate and art works. From the time of his indictment in October, <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> had asked that the arraignment be moved to <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, citing various health problems including kidney and heart ailments. A government doctor, however, after examining <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> there, had pronounced him capable of traveling to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> for arraignment. <PERSON> LaBella </PERSON> requested the court session after <PERSON> Hibey </PERSON> asked <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Keenan </PERSON> to turn a hearing on <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' ability to travel to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> for arraignment into one on whether he was physically competent to ever stand trial. `` What began as merely a request to hold Mr. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' arraignment in <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> rather than <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> has evolved into a genuine concern for his life,'' <PERSON> Hibey </PERSON> wrote the judge in a three-page letter dated Tuesday that included an abbreviated doctor's report. `` We have been advised by the last doctor who examined President <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> that he is dying,'' <PERSON> Hibey </PERSON>'s letter concluded. `` The court should receive all evidence relating to his health and determine at this stage that, if persuaded that such is the case, the prosecution should not go forward against him.'' But <PERSON> LaBella </PERSON> surprised the defense and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Keenan </PERSON> by reversing his previous stand and requesting that `` Mr. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> be arraigned as promptly as possible in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> LaBella </PERSON> said <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' recent hospitalization `` would keep him from traveling for four to six weeks'' and `` further delay is now prejudicing the government's case.'' <PERSON> LaBella </PERSON> said other defendants might seek to go to trial sooner than <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> is able _ prompting the government to conduct more than one trial. But <PERSON> Hibey </PERSON> argued that <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' most recent hospitalization `` does n't begin to tell the story'' of <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' `` multi-system illnesses.'' `` It's a question, your honor, of an ability to survive,'' <PERSON> Hibey </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Keenan </PERSON> decided that a hearing Thursday in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> would consider both aspects: <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' ability to travel for arraignment and his physical ability to stand trial at any time.

 A gynecologist who faces charges from the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> for allegedly performing unnecessary surgery on women has offered to surrender his certificate to practice medicine, his attorney said. Attorney <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said Tuesday that he and Dr. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Burt </PERSON> made the offer while meeting with state officials in <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>. The board has charged <PERSON> Burt </PERSON>, a 67-year-old <LOCATION> Dayton </LOCATION> doctor, with gross immorality for 41 alleged violations ranging from overprescribing drugs to performing unnecessary surgeries. Most of the charges against <PERSON> Burt </PERSON> have to do with his self-described `` love surgery,'' in which he rebuilt women's genital areas, allegedly to enhance their sexual responsiveness. The surgery, however, caused sexual dysfunction, emotional distress, infection, chronic pain, incontinence and the need for corrective surgery in many patients, the board charged. <PERSON> Burt </PERSON> sent a letter to the board last month denying the charges and requesting a hearing. The board tentatively set a Jan. 30 hearing date. But <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said Tuesday his client `` offered to surrender the license and dispense with the hearing. Whether they do that or not, I do n't know. Otherwise, we'll go ahead with the hearing.'' He said <PERSON> Burt </PERSON> has, in effect, retired anyway. `` He's not practicing any medicine at all,'' <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Lauren </PERSON> <PERSON> Lubow </PERSON> did not immediately return telephone calls for comment today. Calls to <PERSON> Burt </PERSON>'s office went unanswered today. Ms. <PERSON> Lubow </PERSON> has said the severest penalty the state board could impose would be permanent revocation of <PERSON> Burt </PERSON>'s license. The board limited the doctor to non-surgical medical practice in November. At least three of <PERSON> Burt </PERSON>'s former patients have each filed $ 3 million medical malpractice suits against the gynecologist. <PERSON> Burt </PERSON> has denied performing the surgery without his patients' permission

 President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, beginning the whirlwind of official activities leading up to his inauguration, promised 250 top school teachers today that he will make good on his promise to become `` the education president.'' `` Education will be on my desk and on my mind right from the start, every day,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told teachers gathered from every state at a forum in the National Museum of Women in the Arts. Paying tribute to their profession, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` My most important message to <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> teachers is a message of appreciation. ... I am awed by your work. `` It is tough work and it's indispensable work and it deserves as much praise and thanks as any job in any profession in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` Certainly you deserve more public recognition than you usually get.'' Then, adding words similar to those his defeated Democratic rival, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, often used in the campaign, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> added, `` Teaching should be one of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s honored professions and I will work to make sure that it is exactly that.'' Teachers invited to the symposium were nominated by state teacher-of-the-year programs, teacher unions, governors, state inaugural committee chairmen and the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Teacher </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> The teachers heard two former governors, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Lamar </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, discuss state efforts to improve schools, and listened to Secretary of Education <PERSON> Lauro </PERSON> <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON> outline the new administration's goals. <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> will be <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s White House chief of staff. `` This is my very first event on the inaugural calendar. ... That's the way I wanted it, meeting with educators,'' he said. `` I know you've heard me say during this campaign that I intended to be the education president. Two days before I begin trying I wanted you to know that I meant it. `` The country is now wide awake to the central role of our schools in determining the future health of our society,'' he said. Even under budgetary constraints, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` we're going to work to make sure that the nation does what needs to be done for our schools: reward excellence, weigh standards, expand choice, publicize success, strive to resolve shortcomings and keep American attention and effort concentrated on further education reform and improvement.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said repeatedly during the campaign that he wanted to be `` the education president.'' He has promised to convene an education summit of governors, university presidents and other leading educators early in his administration. <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON> told the teachers the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration's new $ 500 million `` merit schools'' program will place particular emphasis on reducing dropout rates. The program will provide recognition and financial rewards `` to schools that are accountable and work,'' said <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON>. They will be rated on standards defined by the state `` with some federal guidance,'' he said, on such measures as test scores, college participation rates, employment of graduates and `` success in improving school participation and performance of the disadvantaged and the handicapped.'' <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Parets </PERSON>, a band teacher at <ORGANIZATION> Alexias </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> I. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> DuPont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Wilmington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Del. </LOCATION>, said, `` I was very moved. I sat there thinking he could have met with the heads of foreign states, he could have met with the leaders of the military or the captains of industry and instead he chose to meet with 230 teachers from across the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' `` It was really a very breath-taking experience to sit there and realize that this was happening and that he meant it,'' said <PERSON> Parets </PERSON>, a past <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> teacher of the year whose high school band will march in the inaugural parade. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Weeks </PERSON>, the national teacher of the year from <LOCATION> Murfreesboro </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, said, `` As a teacher I'd have to give him an A on his first test. But also as a teacher we anxiously look forward to the coming tests and to participation with him.'' `` He's proven to us that he was n't lip-synching, that the words were his, that the feelings were his,'' said Weeks, a 7th grade social studies teacher. `` What he can provide more than anything else is kind of what he did today, become a national cheerleader for educational improvement and then make sure that the local areas and the states pitch in.'' <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Kraemer </PERSON>, a writing teacher from <ORGANIZATION> Bayville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Beachwood </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, said, `` I feel very proud, proud that he has cared enough about education to bring us all together.'' But Ms. <PERSON> Kraemer </PERSON>, a vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jersey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, added, `` We did n't gain a whole lot under <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, so we're a little skeptical _ but we're supportive of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>.''

 State officials have ordered nine ski resorts to immediately inspect ski lifts after cracks were found in a chairlift. In an emergency session Tuesday, the <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Passenger </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tramway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> gave the resorts one week to test up to 47 lifts for cracks in a metal brace on chairs. The lifts will not have to be dismantled and can be used in the meantime. Fractures were found in four chairs at <LOCATION> Loveland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Basin </LOCATION> during routine maintenance Saturday. The lift was immediately shut down. Tramway board engineer <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Carrick </PERSON> said the cracks resulted from metal fatigue. `` You try to decide how excited to get about something like this,'' he said. `` Faced with four broken chairs, I'm moderately excited.''

 Investigators believe the luggage container in which the bomb that destroyed <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> Flight 103 was hidden was put on the jumbo jet in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, a newspaper reported today. Police said Tuesday they had identified the luggage container, but would not comment on whether it was placed on the flight in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. `` We have now identified the baggage container within the aircraft in which the explosive device was placed, and substantial forensic and reconstructive work is being undertaken in this regard,'' said Detective Chief Superintendent <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Orr </PERSON>, the Scottish police officer heading the investigation. `` No details of the container, what else it held, where it was discovered or where it originated were given officially but police and accident investigators are now convinced that it was in luggage first loaded at <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> said today. <PERSON> Jochen </PERSON> <PERSON> Schroers </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> prosecutor's office, said the report was `` purely speculative and premature'' and that there was no evidence to support it Police and <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> spokesmen refused today to elaborate on <PERSON> Orr </PERSON>'s remarks or comment on The Times' report. The New York-bound flight originated in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> with a <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727 and changed to a <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 at <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Heathrow </LOCATION> airport, transferring passengres and baggage. All 259 people on board and 11 on the ground in the Scottish town of <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION> were killed after the jet exploded at 31,000 feet on Dec. 21. The Times said police think the bomb consisted of only a few pounds of Czechoslovak-made Semtex plastic explosives. The paper said investigators think that once a hole was blown in the side of the jet and the electronics bay _ its nerve center _ destroyed, the air pressure at the high altitude literally ripped the jet apart. Investigators say the blast occurred in the cargo area just in front of the left wing of the plane. <PERSON> Orr </PERSON> told a news conference that about 10,000 items of baggage and other items from the plane have been recovered in searches stretching across <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>. He said Scottish police were working with their counterparts in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and that more than 3,000 witness statements had been collated. He said some investigations have been conducted in <LOCATION> Scandinavia </LOCATION>, but refused to elaborate. <PERSON> Orr </PERSON> also refused to say which group, if any, police suspect of carrying out the bombing. `` There has been a lot of comment, some ill-informed, and I do not think it would be helpful to identify any group,'' he said. Several terrorist groups are thought to have supplies of Semtex, a powerful and hard-to-detect plastic explosive. British authorities have said the bomb that destroyed Flight 103 was probably Semtex.

 A new sentencing system that took effect in November 1987 for people convicted of federal crimes is constitutional, the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled today in a decision that will affect thousands. By an 8-1 vote, the justices upheld the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Sentencing Commission's rules. The decision also upheld the validity of the commission itself. Scores of federal trial judges have refused to use the new sentencing rules, calling them and the commission unconstitutional. Now, defendants sentenced by those judges must be resentenced. The decision carries no impact, however, for any defendant sentenced in a state court. About 10,000 federal court defendants have been subjected to the new sentencing system. The commission was created by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in the Sentencing Reform Act of 1984, legislation aimed at eliminating what some called unjustified disparities in sentences. The law empowers the commission, with seven members appointed to six-year terms by the president, to tell federal judges what sentences should be imposed for various crimes. Three of the commission's members must be federal judges. The guidelines generally stiffened the prison time federal convicts are required to serve. The commission eliminated parole and curtailed credit for good behavior. Judges who had struck down the new sentencing system had ruled: _ That <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> unlawfully avoided political accountability by unconstitutionally delegating its legislative power to the commission _ That the commission, because it includes members of the judiciary and holds legislative power, violates the Constitution's separation of powers _ That the new rules violate defendants' due-process rights by curbing too severely judges' sentencing discretion Writing for the court today, Justice <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Blackmun </PERSON> said those judges were wrong. `` Congess neither delegated excessive legislative power nor upset the constitutionally mandated balance of powers among the coordinate branches,'' <PERSON> Blackmun </PERSON> said. `` The Constitution's structural protections do not prohibit <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> from delegating to an expert body located within the judicial branch the intricate task of formulating sentencing guidelines consistent with such significant statutory direction as is present here,'' he said. In justifying judges' membership on the commission, <PERSON> Blackmun </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is free to call on the judicial branch's help in `` a matter uniquely within the ken of judges.'' Only Justice <PERSON> Antonin </PERSON> <PERSON> Scalia </PERSON> dissented, on grounds that the commission was given power not authorized by the Constitution. <ORGANIZATION> Sentencing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilkins </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, a judge on the 4th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, called today's ruling `` one of the most important decisions handed down by the court this decade.'' <PERSON> Wilkins </PERSON> said the commission's guidelines `` are now the law of the land, and the barriers to full implementation have been lifted.'' The test case before the justices stemmed from the prosecution of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mistretta </PERSON>, who pleaded guilty to conspiring to possess and distribute cocaine after his 1987 arrest in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo </LOCATION>. Before <PERSON> Mistretta </PERSON>'s sentence was imposed, he challenged the new sentencing rules. A trial judge dismissed the challenge and sentenced <PERSON> Mistretta </PERSON> to 18 months in prison, to be followed by a three-year term of supervised release. Today's decision upheld that sentence. In other action, the court: _ Ruled that labor unions may not fire elected local union officials who disagree with policies of the parent union. The 8-0 decision permits a union business representative in the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> area to sue the <ORGANIZATION> Sheet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Metal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> for his allegedly illegal firing. _ Unanimously struck down a tax in a <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> county </LOCATION> that permitting some property to be taxed at up to 35 times more than neighboring comparable property. But the court, referring to the county tax as `` aberrational'', declined to say whether similar state taxes also are unconstitutional. The sentencing cases are <PERSON> Mistretta </PERSON> vs. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, 87-7028, and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> vs. <PERSON> Mistretta </PERSON>, 87-1904.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled today that labor unions may not fire elected local union officials who disagree with policies of the parent union. The 8-0 decision permits a union business representative in the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> area to sue the <ORGANIZATION> Sheet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Metal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> for his allegedly illegal firing. Justice <PERSON> Thurgood </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>, writing for the court, said firing an elected official _ as opposed to an appointed one _ violates a 1959 federal law, the Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act. The law is designed `` to ensure that unions are democratically governed and responsive to the will of the union membership as expressed in open, periodic elections,'' <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> said. Permitting an official to be fired for expressing dissenting opinions would lead union members to conlude `` that one challenged the union hierarchy, if at all, at one's peril,'' he said. `` That is precisely what <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> sought to prevent when it passed'' the 1959 law. The ruling permits <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON>, elected business representative in 1981 of Local 75 of the <ORGANIZATION> Sheet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Metal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> union, to sue the governing union international. <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> and other members of the local became increasingly critical of spending by the parent union and organized a dissident group that successfully defeated proposals to raise the local's dues. The international union placed Local 75 in trusteeship in 1982 under the leadership of a regional official, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON> proposed a new dues increase that again was defeated, with <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> leading the fight against the hike. <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON> then filed charges against <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON>, and the union international removed <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> from office and fined him $ 2,500. <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> filed a federal lawsuit in 1983 accusing union leaders of firing him illegally and violating his free-speech rights. A federal judge threw out the suit. But the 9th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> reinstated it in 1987. The appeals court ruling was upheld today by the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> said today that <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON>'s situation is different from a case that resulted in a 1982 high court ruling. In that case, the court upheld the firing of a union's appointed business agents by a new union president who defeated the previous president in a union election. The case acted on today is Sheet Metal Workers vs. <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON>, 86-1940.

 Here are excerpts from recent editorials in newspapers throughout the nation. Jan. 12 The Evening Journal, <LOCATION> Martinsburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> W. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, on the federal budget: Federal budget-making is the complex and often painful process of sorting out national priorities ... This year, to compound the difficulties inherent in this task, these choices are now being made by two groups _ President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s departing band of officeholders and President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s incoming group of government managers Like all new presidents, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> must live for a while with the budget he inherits from the departing incumbent. ... Although the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> transition team is working closely with the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration on the fiscal 1990 budget, undoubtedly the new president will want to establish his own priorities as soon as possible. There well may be two budgets this year. Of course, what <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> finally comes up with in the way of government spending generally bears little relationship to the fiscal proposals coming from the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and all the budgets could wind up being exercises in futility.

 <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON>'s death warrant for murdering a girl was signed minutes after the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> rejected his appeal, and the mayor of the slain child's town said the execution would prompt celebrations. In signing the warrant, Gov. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> set the execution for Jan. 24 for the 1978 rape and murder of 12-year-old <PERSON> Kimberly </PERSON> <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> Leach </PERSON>, who was abducted in <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and was found dead in a pig sty. It was the fourth time the 42-year-old former law student has been scheduled to die in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s electric chair. <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON>, whose case was depicted in the television miniseries `` The Deliberate Stranger,'' has come within hours of being executed only to win postponement. His attorneys said after Tuesday's 7-2 high court decision they would pursue further appeals. There also were reports today that <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> might offer information about other killings in an attempt to delay his execution. <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> also has also been sentenced to death for killing two women in a <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> sorority house in <LOCATION> Tallahassee </LOCATION> three weeks before <PERSON> Kimberly </PERSON>'s murder. He has been linked to up to 36 sex murders or disappearances of young women, most in <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state. `` Justice has been on hold for a decade, and it's about time <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> paid for his crimes,'' <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> said. `` I have a strong feeling on Tuesday of next week, the state will be able to carry out its duty.'' `` There'll be a celebration when he dies,'' said <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Witt </PERSON>, mayor of <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, a rural town of 11,000 people near the <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> border. `` He has such a terrible criminal record. It's just impossible to have any sympathy for him.'' In <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> authorities believe <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> was responsible for the disappearances of five teen-age girls and think he may have been involved in that of a young woman. Sheriff <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayward </PERSON> said Tuesday that investigators would travel to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> this weekend to question <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON>, perhaps for one last time. In western <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state, <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> is the prime suspect in the 1974 slayings of eight young women, whose murders remain unsolved. `` I ca n't believe it's finally going to come to an end,'' said <PERSON> Eleanore </PERSON> <PERSON> Rose </PERSON>, whose daughter, <PERSON> Denise </PERSON> <PERSON> Naslund </PERSON>, was one of the eight. `` They keep giving him appeal after appeal after appeal. Now that it -LRB- the execution -RRB- may happen, I'm in a kind of shock. `` It's not going to bring <PERSON> Denise </PERSON> back. All of us who lost daughters, we're still going to have all those unanswered questions,'' Ms. <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> said. She said she had hoped <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> would confess to the slayings `` to put our minds at ease.'' State Attorney <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Blair </PERSON>, who prosecuted <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> in the <PERSON> Leach </PERSON> case, said there's `` a move underfoot to delay his execution on grounds that he's ready to come clean and tell everything he knows.'' `` As far as I'm concerned, he'd have to talk between now and Tuesday,'' <PERSON> Blair </PERSON> added. `` Bundy has been on death row for over 10 years, and I would have to view any offer to talk now as a continuing effort to buy time.'' In addition, a prison spokesman said today that <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> had changed his mind about talking to journalists. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Macmaster </PERSON>, a spokesman for the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corrections </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> agreed to hold an hour-long group interview Monday afternoon, followed by a one-hour interview with a single newspaper or broadcast station that <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> will pick. In the appeal rejected Tuesday, <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON>'s attorneys argued that lower courts wrongly determined in retrospect that <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> had been competent to stand trial in 1980 for <PERSON> Kimberly </PERSON>'s slaying. A federal judge in 1986 ruled that <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> had been competent in 1980, calling him `` the most competent serial killer in the country at this time ... a diabolical genius.'' The 11th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> upheld the judge's ruling. The appeal said the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> `` has never addressed the issue of when, if ever, a -LRB- post-trial -RRB- hearing would be adequate to remedy a violation of a defendant's right ... to a contemporary determination of his competency when sufficient -LRB- indications -RRB- arise at trial.'' The high court in 1966 said defendants have a right to such a `` contemporary'' competency hearing. <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON>'s attorney <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Coleman </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, said he planned to file a new emergency appeal in a <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> state court, but refused to disclose what legal arguments would be used.

To the contrary, it would hit them extremely hard.

One of government's primary responsibilities is providing for a strong national defense. Being stuck in a militarily vulnerable position could spell our doom faster than anything else. At the same time, though, government also has a duty to care for its people _ who, after all, are the government.

Riot control is not a normal military function, and this undoubtedly accounts for the high death rate in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> while comparable uprisings in <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> resulted in few deaths. This week <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops took the unprecedented step of ordering small midnight burials for intifadah victims, since their funerals have often produced more confrontation and death. Such steps cast the <ORGANIZATION> IDF </ORGANIZATION> in an opprobrious role.

 Jan. 16 The <LOCATION> Albuquerque </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> N.M. </LOCATION> -RRB- Tribune on insurance for bank and thrift deposits: In its final report, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisers </ORGANIZATION> made an interesting recommendation: lower the ceiling on federally insured deposits in banks and thrift institutions. Deposit insurance is a Depression-era idea that once made sense. It discouraged runs on banks and gave small savers a safe place for their money. Recently, however, it contributed to a national crap shoot that may cost the public $ 100 billion. In 1980, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> unwisely raised the insurance limit to $ 100,000 from $ 40,000. Thus a device designed to protect mom and pop depositors became a no-lose game for the wealthy, who could put a no-risk $ 100,000 in one bank _ or $ 1 million in 10 banks. Because of go-go banking, money brokers, lax regulation and deposit insurance, the taxpayers are about to take a huge hit to rescue the thrift industry. The way to protect themselves from a future hit is to stop guaranteeing other people's unwise investments.

While perhaps not ranking on the scale of deforestation, offshore oil spills and disposable diapers as a source of enviromental harm, DPI is warning teachers and students that helium-filled latex and Mylar balloons can have a disastrous effect on wildlife. In 1985, a young sperm whale munching on a school of squid accidentally swallowed a deflated Mylar balloon. The balloon blocked the whale's intestines and it contracted food poisoning. Dead and dying hawksbill sea turtles and loggerhead turtles, both endangered species, have been found with latex balloons in their intestines. Balloons are wondrous playthings, but massive balloon launches are wasteful and destructive. Teachers would not approve of dumping 30 message-filled bottles in a stream just to see where they go; neither should they encourage students to loose message-filled balloons into the air.

 <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-designate <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> told big-city mayors today he would be an activist and advocate for solving housing and other urban problems, calling himself `` a big-L liberal'' on urban issues. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, addressing the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mayors </ORGANIZATION>, cited the problems posed by federal budget constraints but spoke enthusiastically about working with mayors, whose complaints about cuts in federal aid to cities have been a constant refrain. `` I'm going to throw the labels out. We're going to throw out ideology,'' said the former <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> congressman chosen by President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to head the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> and urban Development. `` I am going to be an activist. I'm going to be an advocate. The door is open. My mind is open.'' <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, a conservative who unsuccessfully sought the Republican presidential nomination, drew applause from the mayors when he described himself as `` a bleeding heart conservative'' and `` a progressive conservative.'' He added, `` I want to be considered a big-L liberal'' on race, poverty, and relations between mayors and <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> listened as mayors described problems in their cities caused by a shortage of affordable housing and cuts in federal housing aid and other programs. He noted that he has been associated with tax reform but said `` it went too far when it comes to affordable, low - and moderate income housing. He added: `` I'm speaking for <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> now, I'm not speaking for the administration.'' The conference on Tuesday released a survey showing increased hunger and homelessness in mayor <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> cities, particularly among families and children. Sen. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Sasser </PERSON>, D-Tenn., the new chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, called the findings `` a devastating indictment of the neglect of the needs of our major urban centers. He said the mayors make a `` compelling case'' for more federal assistance to help the homeless problem. `` devastating indictment'' of the neglect of urban America. <PERSON> Sasser </PERSON> said President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s budget proposal for fiscal 1990 virtually ignores the problem of urban homelessness and that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will expect a revised proposal from the new administration. `` Families _ women and children _ they make up the most significant increase we have experienced'' in homelessness, <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON> said in releasing the findings. <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON> said the rate of increase in hunger and homelessness seemed to slow from the previous year. He attributed that in part to increased emergency services provided by state and local governments. Officials in every city surveyed cited the lack of affordable housing as the main cause of homelessness. <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON> cited the decline in federal spending on low-income housing during the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. `` Shelters are not the answer,'' <PERSON> Flynn </PERSON> said. `` Permanent, affordable housing _ that is the answer.'' Among the survey's findings were that in the last year in the 27 surveyed cities: _ Requests for emergency shelter increased an average 13 percent All but two of the cities reported an increase. The rate of increase had been 18 percent in a similar survey a year ago. _ Requests for emergency food were up in nine of 10 cities, by an average 19 percent Three-fifths of those asking for emergency food were members of families. _ An average 19 percent of the requests for emergency shelter went unmet; among homeless families, 23 percent of requests were unmet Shelters in two out of three cities reported they turn away homeless families because of a lack of resources. _ In 62 percent of the cities, emergency food assistance facilities had to turn away people because of lack of resources _ On average the composition of the homeless population was 49 percent single men, 34 percent members of families, 13 percent single women and 5 percent unaccompanied youth One in four was a child. An average 34 percent of homeless were substance abusers and one-fourth were severely mentally ill; 23 percent had full-time or part-time jobs; 26 percent were veterans. The survey was conducted in 27 cities whose mayors sit on the conference's task force on hunger and homelessness. They were: <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION>, P.R.; <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo </LOCATION>.; <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Trenton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paul </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Providence </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> R.I. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>; and <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>.

 President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> suffered a mild stroke today and was admitted to a military hospital. His office said he was `` clear-minded'' and might appoint a temporary replacement. Officials said <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>, who turned 73 last week, was in stable condition at No. 2 Military Hospital in the <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Wynberg </LOCATION>. His office said no further medical statements would be issued for the time being unless the president's condition worsened. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> has for the most part enjoyed excellent health since he took charge of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s white-controlled government as prime minister in 1978. Under a new constitution, he became president in 1984. The modern, five-story hospital in <LOCATION> Wynberg </LOCATION>, part of a military base, is considered one of the best in southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> laid the cornerstone for the main building in 1976, when he was defense minister. The president's wife for 46 years, <PERSON> Elize </PERSON>, and some of their five children came to the hospital to be with her husband, the state radio said. The state-run South African <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> suffered the stroke early in the morning while at his home. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>'s office said the president remained in charge of the country `` along with the rest of the Cabinet.'' <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>'s staff initially said the Cabinet would meet to consider naming an acting president, but later his office said <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> was `` quite clear-minded'' and was likely to make the appointment himself on Thursday. According to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s Constitution, the president can appoint a <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> minister to fill in for him temporarily. If the president is incapacitated, the Cabinet can elect one of its members as acting president. <PERSON> Caspar </PERSON> <PERSON> Venter </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> official, said any of several senior <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> ministers could be designated to fill in for the president in the event of his absence from the country or his incapacitation. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> has refused to comment about when he might step down from the presidency. There has been intense speculation, but no consensus, about which <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> member might be selected by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> as <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>'s successor. Among those mentioned as possible successors are Foreign Affairs Minister <PERSON> Pik </PERSON> <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>, who is not related to the president; <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> Minister F.W. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON>; Constitutional Development Minister <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Heunis </PERSON>; and Defense Minister <PERSON> Magnus </PERSON> <PERSON> Malan </PERSON>. During his years in power, <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> has maintained the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s political dominance despite harsh criticism both from the anti-apartheid movement and from extreme-right whites. He has presided over the first significant racial reforms undertaken during the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s 40-year rule, such as legalization of interracial marriages and abolition of pass laws, which restricted blacks' movements. But he has refused to negotiate with the <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, the main guerrilla movement fighting the government, or to release the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION>'s jailed leader, <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> has refused to discuss the possibility of a one-person, one-vote system in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, where the 5 million whites control the government and economy while the 26 million blacks have no vote in national affairs. The <LOCATION> Wynberg </LOCATION> hospital is about a mile from the Constantiaberg Clinic, where <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> spent several weeks recuperating from tuberculosis last year before being transferred to a staff home at a prison farm in the town of <LOCATION> Paarl </LOCATION>.

 The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Educational </ORGANIZATION>, Scientific and Cultural Organization will hold an international conference here next year on ways to reduce illiteracy, a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> official announced Wednesday. <ORGANIZATION> UNESCO </ORGANIZATION> Director-General <PERSON> Federico </PERSON> <PERSON> Mayor </PERSON> <PERSON> Zaragoza </PERSON> said the seven-day gathering will dramatize the plight of 1 billion people worldwide who can not read or write. `` We're in a very good moment in contemporary history'' to try to wipe out illiteracy by the end of the century, he said.'s goals. <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> will be <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s White House chief of staff. `` This is my very first event on the inaugural calendar. ... That's the way I wanted it, meeting with educators,'' he said. `` I know you've heard me say during this campaign that I intended to be the education president. Two days before I begin trying I wanted you to know that I meant it. `` The country is now wide awake to the central role of our schools in determining the future health of our society,'' he said. Even under budgetary constraints, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` we're going to work to make sure that the nation does what needs to be done for our schools: reward excellence, raise standards, expand choice, publicize success, strive to resolve shortcomings and keep American attention and effort concentrated on further education reform and improvement.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said repeatedly during the campaign that he wanted to be `` the education president.'' He has promised to convene an education summit of governors, university presidents and other leading educators early in his administration. <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON> told the teachers the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration's new $ 500 million `` merit schools'' program will place particular emphasis on reducing dropout rates. The program will provide recognition and financial rewards `` to schools that are accountable and work,'' said <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON>. They will be rated on standards defined by the state `` with some federal guidance,'' he said, on such measures as test scores, college participation rates, employment of graduates and `` success in improving school participation and performance of the disadvantaged and the handicapped.'' <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Parets </PERSON>, a band teacher at <ORGANIZATION> Alexias </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> I. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> DuPont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Wilmington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Del. </LOCATION>, said, `` I was very moved. I sat there thinking he could have met with the heads of foreign states, he could have met with the leaders of the military or the captains of industry and instead he chose to meet with 230 teachers from across the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' `` It was really a very breath-taking experience to sit there and realize that this was happening and that he meant it,'' said <PERSON> Parets </PERSON>, a past <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> teacher of the year whose high school band will march in the inaugural parade. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Weeks </PERSON>, the national teacher of the year from <LOCATION> Murfreesboro </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, said, `` As a teacher I'd have to give him an A on his first test. But also as a teacher we anxiously look forward to the coming tests and to participation with him.'' `` He's proven to us that he was n't lip-synching, that the words were his, that the feelings were his,'' said Weeks, a 7th grade social studies teacher. `` What he can provide more than anything else is kind of what he did today, become a national cheerleader for educational improvement and then make sure that the local areas and the states pitch in.'' <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Kraemer </PERSON>, a writing teacher from <ORGANIZATION> Bayville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Beachwood </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, said, `` I feel very proud, proud that he has cared enough about education to bring us all together.'' But Ms. <PERSON> Kraemer </PERSON>, a vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jersey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, added, `` We did n't gain a whole lot under <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, so we're a little skeptical _ but we're supportive of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>.''

<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Prosecutors said today they have opened a criminal investigation into I.B.I. Engineering, a company <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials accused of helping build a suspected Libyan chemical weapons plant. In <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>, opposition lawmakers shouted and hooted during a parliamentary session in which the government again altered its official position on when it knew about the suspect plant, which <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> claims will produce pharmaceuticals. Besides the I.B.I. Engineering probe, federal officials are investigating overall West German involvement, and a local prosecutor in the southern city of <LOCATION> Offenburg </LOCATION> is investigating the Imhausen-Chemie company. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials allege <ORGANIZATION> Imhausen </ORGANIZATION> also was a major participant in the Libyan project. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> ARD </ORGANIZATION> television estimated that 50 companies in the <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> area alone had a role in building the Libyan plant. `` Our authorities opened the probe against I.B.I. on Friday because of suspicion of reported violations of export laws,'' <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> prosecutor <PERSON> Jochen </PERSON> <PERSON> Schroers </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in a telephone interview today. He did not say why the investigation was not announced earlier. Schroers refused to provide further information about the investigation of the now-defunct company owned by <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> businessman <PERSON> Ihsan </PERSON> <PERSON> Barbouti </PERSON>, who reportedly coordinated the Libyan plant construction. I.B.I. allegedly provided the contracts to the West German companies. Earlier today in <LOCATION> Munich </LOCATION>, prosecutors said they have begun a criminal investigation of a Bavarian firm that a news magazine says helped <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> develop the ability for in-flight refueling of warplanes. <LOCATION> Munich </LOCATION> Prosecutor <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON> <PERSON> Stocker </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Intec </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Logistic </ORGANIZATION> company was suspected of violating <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s export laws He said the probe was focusing on whether `` -LRB- fuel -RRB- tank equipment sent to <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> required an export permit.'' Government officials have said some West German companies with connections to the Libyan plant may have been unwitting participants. Three more companies were added to the growing list Tuesday. In <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Wolfgang </PERSON> <PERSON> Schaeuble </PERSON>, Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s chief of staff, said today that `` on the basis of intelligence reports, we must assume that this plant in <LOCATION> Rabta </LOCATION> is intended to produce chemical weapons.'' On Tuesday, chief government spokesman <PERSON> Friedhelm </PERSON> <PERSON> Ost </PERSON> refused to say whether <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> had evidence backing charges the plant was built to produce such weapons. <PERSON> Schaeuble </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> informed West German officials May 18 about possible <LOCATION> German </LOCATION> involvement in the plant. That's five months earlier than what the government acknowledged Monday, and six months earlier than the Nov. 15 date West German leaders mentioned three weeks ago. Israeli leaders criticized German involvement in the Libyan complex, pointing out that <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> is one of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s most dangerous enemies. Israeli Finance Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> was expected to take up the matter with Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> when he begins a four-day visit to <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> today. The Merck chemical company on Tuesday notified government officials it had shipped 19 tons of a chemical solvent to <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> last year, adding that the destination may have been the suspected poison gas plant in <LOCATION> Rabta </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Merck </PERSON> has regular business dealings with <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, most involving small deliveries of chemicals and medicines to hospitals and universities, said company spokesman <PERSON> Hans-Joachim </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmitt </PERSON>. On the same day, <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Barmann </PERSON>, head of the local branch of the Rhenus transportation company in <LOCATION> Cologne </LOCATION>, said his firm had entered into contracts with I.B.I. in 1986, 1987 and 1988 to deliver materials to <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>. `` Construction materials and, in one case, chemicals were involved,'' <PERSON> Barmann </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> in a telephone interview. <PERSON> Barmann </PERSON> declined to provide further details, adding that federal customs officials had seized the company's records as part of the Libyan probe. Other West German companies reportedly involved include the <ORGANIZATION> Salzgitter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industriebau </ORGANIZATION> company, which according to <ORGANIZATION> Stern </ORGANIZATION> magazine made the plans for the facility 60 miles south of <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Salzgitter </PERSON> <PERSON> Industriebau </PERSON>, which is fully-owned by the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> German </LOCATION> government, has denied participation. Also Tuesday, the <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Teves </PERSON> company of <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> told the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> that it had supplied $ 2.8 million worth of ventilation equipment to I.B.I. in 1986. Spokesman <PERSON> Gerd </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinreich </PERSON> said the company believed the material was to be used for a pharmaceutical plant in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>. Stern magazine says the <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> plant was built to disguise West German involvement in the Libyan facility.

 <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON> is going skiing. <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> McLaughlin </PERSON> is going back to school. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> is going to have to get a driver's license. As <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s presidency comes to an end, so do the heady times atop <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s power structure for many members of his Cabinet and other ranking officials of the administration. Some are staying on with President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, including Education Secretary <PERSON> Lauro </PERSON> <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON>, Treasury Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, and administration veteran <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, who will be the new secretary of state. But for some of the others, January has meant packing boxes, selling homes and deciding what to do next. In some cases, what's next may be a fat salary and a job with a big law firm or corporation Or it may mean taking it easy. Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> and his wife <PERSON> Helena </PERSON> have sold their house in <LOCATION> Bethesda </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, and booked a commercial flight back home to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> on Inauguration Day. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> plans to write his memoirs and consider what else to do. He has a standing offer to return to teaching at <ORGANIZATION> Stanford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, but he appears to have left behind the corporate world, where he earned $ 1 million a year as an executive of <ORGANIZATION> Bechtel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. But first things first. After 6 -LCB- years of being chauffeured and accompanied by security agents, and not driving a car once, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> plans to take the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> driver's test to obtain a new license. He will keep a bodyguard for at least a month after leaving <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Housing and Urban Development Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, the only member of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s original Cabinet to last all eight years, plans to return to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, where he has kept a home two blocks off Central Park. At age 66, he'll return to practicing law, although he says he may not return to the firm he left in 1981. `` I've been in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> three times,'' <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> said. `` I served under three separate presidents. And each time I always do the same thing _ I go back to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and practice law and join a bunch of boards of companies.'' <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON>, secretary of <ORGANIZATION> interior </ORGANIZATION>, is going to think about what to do next while spending the remainder of the winter skiing in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>. `` I'm going to have to get serious about earning a living,'' <PERSON> Hodel </PERSON> said. `` And I really at this point do n't have any idea.'' He's sold his <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> home and has bought one west of <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>. He's also bought a season ski pass for four big ski areas there. `` I think I'll make a better decision about what I should do and what I should be in the future after a little of that,'' he said. <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> McLaughlin </PERSON>, secretary of labor for little more than a year, will resume studies at the <ORGANIZATION> Wharton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION>, where she was studying when <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> asked her to join the Cabinet. She had worked at the treasury and interior departments earlier in the administration. Agriculture Secretary <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> says he'll sleep in on the day after the inauguration _ and maybe the next day, too. `` I intend to take it easier,'' he said. `` I've reached that age -LRB- 70 -RRB- when I do n't have to worry about justifying myself every day, so I'm not going to worry about that.'' He came to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> 20 years ago when <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> named him an assistant secretary of agriculture. He plans to remain, but is considering buying a second home in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. Health and Human Services Secretary <PERSON> Otis </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowen </PERSON>, also 70, has put his condominium on the market. He plans to retire to rural <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, where he was a doctor, and spend his time reading, writing and tending to his five acres. His first priority is getting tomato seedlings going in his greenhouse in time for spring transplanting. He's bought a riding lawnmower and recently installed a hot tub in the greenhouse, for relaxing after all that work. Energy Secretary <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Herrington </PERSON> plans to return to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> and his real estate investments. He's considering job prospects, and he seems to be in a hurry to get started. He's booked on a plane out Thursday night, the evening before Inauguration Day. Commerce Secretary <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Verity </PERSON>, 71, who has been in the job just 14 months, will return to his home in <LOCATION> Beaufort </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION> His agenda: fishing, hunting, golf, tennis and sailing. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Carclucci </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> secretary, says he'd like to find a job outside government and remain in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` I've given thought to it but I have n't decided anything,'' he said. `` It's a little hard from this perch to look around for jobs. Every time somebody calls me on the phone, I have to disqualify myself.'' <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Z. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wick </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> and a close friend of the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION>, will return to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> with his wife <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Jane </PERSON>. <PERSON> Wick </PERSON>, a former band leader whose name originally was <PERSON> Zwick </PERSON>, plans to resume doing what he was doing before <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s election _ arranging financing for movies and other show business deals.

<TEXT>
 The government, under Israeli attack over a <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> minister's meeting with <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, is trying to convey the message that it is not tilting away from <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. The British government is stressing that it does not recognize the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> as the Palestinians' sole representative, does not support the creation of an independent Palestinian state, and has no plans for <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> to meet Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>. Newspaper accounts, as well as a government source, drew a picture of a prime minister who wants to leave <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peacemaking to the Americans and appear neutral without seeming to go up against a minister in her own government. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> was criticized sharply by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> this week over a meeting in <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION> between <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> and <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Waldegrave </PERSON>, a junior <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> minister, and the remarks <PERSON> Waldegrave </PERSON> made during and after the meeting. The Israelis were particularly incensed to hear <PERSON> Waldegrave </PERSON> suggesting that <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> and Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> both were ex-terrorists. <PERSON> Waldegrave </PERSON> warned <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> against `` clever-silly'' responses to <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s new peacemaking posture, and said that if <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> failed to grasp the initiative it would be `` left behind.'' The tabloid <PERSON> Sun </PERSON> denounced <PERSON> Waldegrave </PERSON>'s `` insulting attitude toward <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'' and the Evening Standard ran a cartoon showing British dignitaries from the archbishop of <LOCATION> Canterbury </LOCATION> downward lining up to embrace <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>. <PERSON> Greville </PERSON> <PERSON> Janner </PERSON>, a veteran pro-Israel lawmaker, accused <PERSON> Waldegrave </PERSON> of `` publicly lecturing and tactlessly attacking <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s democratically elected leaders while sitting beside a man who until recently was responsible for a series of savage terrorist attacks on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s people. But other papers generally backed <PERSON> Waldegrave </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Janner </PERSON>, speaking in a parliamentary debate on the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> on Tuesday night, was a lone voice. Members of the governing <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> as well as opposition Laborites rallied around <PERSON> Waldegrave </PERSON>, and Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> pointedly sat beside him through the debate. As a member of Parliament Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> represents <LOCATION> Finchley </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> constituency with a large Jewish population, and is known to harbor strong personal affection for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. But she already has disagreed with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> on the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s recent decision to recognize <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and disavow terrorism, believing it is an opportunity <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> should seize. During the parliamentary debate, her contributions were guarded. She said she wanted both sides to sit down to peaceful negotiations, but cautioned that it would take a long time and that `` nothing could be started before the new administration in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is well in position and has decided precisely what is its policy.'' The Times of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> said Tuesday that Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> was trying to avert a clash with <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> and prevent the <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION> meeting, the highest-level British-PLO encounter so far, from raising further diplomatic heat. On Wednesday, a government source speaking on condition of anonymity indicated that the government did not want to carry <PERSON> Waldegrave </PERSON>'s remarks further, and that the aim was now to `` pour oil on these troubled waters.'' The source insisted there was no change in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s policy of not recognizing the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> as the Palestinians' sole representative, and its wish for Palestinian national aspirations to be met in a confederation with <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON>, rather than through an independent state. The source also said Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, who has invited <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, had no plans to meet with <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>. The British are keen to knock down any notion that they are trying to play broker. They believe Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> enjoys the respect of all the parties involved, and that <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> still derives influence in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> from its empire days. But as the source put it Wednesday, <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> recognizes that `` the people with the real clout'' are the Americans.

<TEXT>
 A <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> company has agreed not to contend in ads that its water treatment system removes certain chemicals unless it can back up what it says, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday. The company, <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mills </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, signed a proposed consent decree that also requires it not to claim without substantiation that the membrane cartridge of its Pollenex Bottled Water Maker Reverse Osmosis System can last a year without replacement. The commission's complaint said the company had contended in advertising that its system removed `` up to 99 percent of organic chemicals and other contaminants from tap water,'' and nearly all or most of the family of chemicals called trihalomethanes, which can be produced by chlorination. However, the company had no basis for that claim, the <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> said. Under the decree, <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> must have a `` reasonable basis'' for any claims of performance or longevity of its water treatment products. By signing the decree, <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> neither admitted nor denied guilt. However, it will make itself liable for a fine of $ 10,000 if it should be found to have violated any terms in the future, if the decree is adopted. The commission will receive public comment on the decree until March 20, after which it will decide whether to adopt it.

 Security guards, baffled for eight days by false alarms at <ORGANIZATION> Twin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rivers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, have found the culprit: a teddy bear. Principal <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Phipps </PERSON> said the mystery was solved when a maintenance worker smacked his hand down on a ladder in frustration. The teddy bear replied with a beep. The bear, a learning tool for special needs children, responds with a beep to touch, movement or sound, <PERSON> Phipps </PERSON> said. Someone had left the bear on a heat register. Every time the hot-water heater clanked at night, the bear beeped, triggering a silent alarm repeatedly over the winter holidays. `` All we had to do was move the toy,'' <PERSON> Phipps </PERSON> said. `` The bear's been behaving himself ever since.

 The Greek Orthodox patriarch of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> hurled a golden cross into the muddy <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> on Wednesday and released two white doves to bless the site where tradition says <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> was baptized. During an annual ceremony at the steep river bank, Patriarch <PERSON> Diodoros </PERSON> <PERSON> I </PERSON> was surrounded by about 300 pilgrims, most of them Palestinian and Greek women. Many held plastic and glass bottles to be filled with blessed river water. About a dozen <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers armed with submachine guns guarded the pilgrims as they made their way along barbed wire fences and mine fields to the river bank. Attendance has dropped by about 80 percent since the beginning of the Palestinian uprising in December 1987, said Father Innocent, a Greek Orthodox priest. `` People are simply scared,'' he said. The <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> has served as a cease-fire line since the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war when <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> captured the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>. Shortly after the war, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> closed the river bank to visitors because of shelling by Palestinian guerrillas. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> first allowed <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orthodox </ORGANIZATION> denominations to return for their annual baptism ceremony in 1981. Roman Catholics, who hold a ceremony nearby in October, followed in 1985. `` The border makes me feel worried,'' said <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Kalivas </PERSON>, a truck driver from <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION>. `` This is not what I had imagined,'' he added, pointing at the barren desert lining the 60-foot-wide river. `` Everything looks so desolate,'' added <PERSON> Stefan </PERSON> <PERSON> Durst </PERSON>, a Lutheran pastor from <LOCATION> Hamburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Durst </PERSON> said he came out of professional curiosity. Other pilgrims were more cheerful. `` I'm not scared. We've come here to pray to <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Shahira </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahle </PERSON>, 18, who came with a group of 50 Israeli Arab pilgrims from the northern Israeli town of <LOCATION> Nazareth </LOCATION>. Also among the pilgrims were Russian and Romanian nuns in black habits and black cone-shaped velvet caps. The three-hour ceremony began with the reading of psalms and scriptures in Greek and Arabic at St. <PERSON> John </PERSON>'s Monastery. The site, along with other monasteries near the river, was abandoned in 1970 after a Romanian monk was killed by Palestinian guerrillas, said <PERSON> Shmuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamburger </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>'s military government. After the prayers, the patriarch led a procession of 40 chanting priests in black and gold robes to the river bank. <PERSON> Diodoros </PERSON> then hurled the cross, tied to a rope and wrapped in a bunch of basil, into the murky river. The two white doves released by the patriarch fluttered over the river before settling among the reeds at the water's edge.

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> industry operated at its highest rate in nine years last month, the government reported Wednesday, but analysts said the modest pace of growth should allay fears of increasing inflation. Use of industrial capacity at factories, mines and utilities rose 0.1 percentage point to 84.2 percent last month, the highest rate since it hit 84.3 percent in November 1979, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> said. The operating rate for November 1988 was a revised 84.1 percent, and October's figure was 84.0 percent. In an accompanying report, the agency said industrial production climbed a moderate 0.3 percent in December following a revised increase of 0.4 percent in November. While high operating rates can cause concern that factories will have trouble meeting demand, resulting in shortages and higher prices, economists said December's increases were small enough that they did n't point to higher inflation. <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Chimerine </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> WEFA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, consultants in <PERSON> Bala </PERSON> <PERSON> Cynwyd </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, said the reports were `` consistent with continued recovery in the industrial sector and moderate growth in the economy as a whole.'' `` It's probably the best of both worlds,'' he said. `` It showed continued expansion but at a moderate pace.'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Brusca </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Nikko </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> said that while operating rates were high, the specter of inflation `` does n't seem to be as much on our doorstep as some people have pretended. On the other hand, <PERSON> Brusca </PERSON> expressed concern that production `` is not increasing fast enough to satisfy domestic demand and to make progress'' on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit, which widened to $ 12.5 billion in November. At manufacturing plants, the operating rate climbed to 84.4 percent last month from 84.3 percent in October. The operating rate for durable goods _ `` big ticket'' items expected to last at least three years _ rose by 0.1 percentage point to 83.0 percent, while the rate for non-durable goods fell by a like margin to 86.4 percent. Industries with especially strong operating rates over the past two years include primary metals, chemicals, fabricated metal products, non-electrical machinery, autos and automotive parts. Capacity utilization for manufacturers of motor vehicles and parts rose for the fifth straight month to 88.1 percent, up from 85.5 percent in November. The December operating rate at utilities was 81.9 percent, up from 81.3 percent a month earlier. In the mining, which includes oil and gas drilling, the operating rate was up 0.1 percentage point to 83.3 percent. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>'s industrial production index now stands at 140.2 percent of its 1977 base, reflecting sharp gains in auto production and continued strength in production of construction supplies. The index has not declined since September 1987, reflecting an export-driven manufacturing boom accompanied by a surge in spending for capital equipment to expand and modernize factories. Production in manufacturing rose 0.3 percent in December following a revised increase at the same rate for the month earlier. Automobiles were assembled at an annual rate of 7.9 million units, up from 7.6 million in November. Production of light trucks also rose. Output at mines was unchanged in December after a 1.4 percent rise a month earlier. Production at utilities was up 0.8 percent from November. Total output at factories, mines and utilities was up 4.7 percent from a year earlier.

 A former <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> technician pleaded innocent Wednesday to charges he tried to sell anti-submarine warfare secrets to the Soviets. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Doumar </PERSON> set an April 3 trial for <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kunkle </PERSON>, 39, of <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, who was arrested and charged with espionage Jan. 10 in an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> sting. <PERSON> Kunkle </PERSON> said he wanted to become a Soviet spy for the money and to get back at the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>, which discharged him for indecent exposure in 1985, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> said. The former chief petty officer is confident he will be exonerated, and `` his spirits are good,'' defense attorney <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> said after the arraignment. `` There are two sides to every story. All you've heard so far is what the government claims occurred in this case,'' he said. <PERSON> Kunkle </PERSON>, a hospital security guard, was arrested in <LOCATION> Williamsburg </LOCATION> by two <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents posing as Soviet officials. As a hidden camera recorded the meeting, <PERSON> Kunkle </PERSON> revealed secret information that he recalled from his job as an anti-submarine warfare instructor four years ago, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Kunkle </PERSON> was paid $ 5,000 for the information, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> said no classified information reached the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Kunkle </PERSON> remained jailed without bail.

Trial preparations are expected to be complicated because classified information is involved and court personnel must receive security clearances. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> said the defense could be helped by the government's reluctance to reveal classified materials in court `` There is a disincentive for the government to reveal information and it can work to your advantage,'' he said. `` Whether it will in this case remains to be seen.''

 When President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> donned white tie and tails last week to attend a fancy dinner in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, he confided to aides he'd had the elegantly styled suit made 40 years ago, for the 1948 Academy Awards. `` It's hard to believe, but it's true,'' said presidential spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, a man who is well-acquainted with the battle of the bulge. `` I do n't think he's even had it altered.'' <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, who leaves office Friday, bore the burdens of the presidency for two terms and even weathered a harrowing assassination attempt in 1981 not to mention a 1985 bout with colon cancer and a few other surgeries. Yet, except for a few more wrinkles _ and some gray hair _ he's retained a physique that defies the image of a 77-year-old grandfather Those close to him _ including first lady <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> _ say it's all due to a remarkable discipline, begun as a teen-age lifeguard and honed as an actor, attentive to diet and physical fitness `` He's in amazing health,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohr </PERSON>, one of the president's <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> physicians. `` It has to do with genes, but also with his attitude. He's just always on an even keel.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has never been shy about the fact that he's religiously followed a 9-to-5 office schedule, allowing plenty of time for rest and relaxation. Over his eight-year presidency, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has spent some 457 days in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, mostly on vacation at his ranch near <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barbara </LOCATION> or in his old home town of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. Aides point out that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s sense of humor, and an ability to avoid taking himself too seriously, may have helped keep him in shape. Pictures of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, dubbed `` Rawhide'' by the <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, adorn many White House walls. One favorite shows the president in jeans, workshirt and protective goggles, with chainsaw in hand and biceps bulging, as he mows down wizened scrub oak trees on his <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> ranch. The president chats often with his aides about his diet and how he keeps healthy, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. He is so conscientious about using his body-building equipment on a daily basis that he had it hauled to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> last year for the three-day summit with Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. `` He worked out every night, after the meetings and before dinner,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. `` I peel down and go into the gym,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said in a recent interview with <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>' `` 60 Minutes,'' adding that he uses `` a treadmill and various Nautilus weight equipment.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, in the same interview, said she's had to temper <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s enthusiasm for the exercises _ suggested by his physicians as a way to get back in shape after the 1981 shooting and chest surgery _ because the president was adding so much muscle he was threatening to outgrow his suits. `` I kept saying, ` Stop. Do n't increase any more. This is getting too expensive!'' Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said with a laugh. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> keeps a constant watch on his weight _ hovering at 189 to 190 pounds with a 34-inch waistline _ by comparing himself weekly with his personal physician, Dr. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hutton </PERSON>, who also tries to hold to the weight level. `` Every Tuesday we have a weigh-off,'' said <PERSON> Hutton </PERSON> recently. `` If we're a pound or two over, we see who can get it off first.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, who says she also tries to follow a daily exercise routine, recalls that at one time in college she weighed 145 pounds, but now weighs only 105 or 106 pounds. At a recent luncheon, the first lady pooh-poohed reports that she was anorexic, contending that the worries over her husband's shooting, as well as her parents' deaths, had caused her to drop some pounds while in the White House With a big smile, Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> eagerly scooped up a dessert of bread pudding. But the first lady made clear that the president's eating and exercise habits are his alone. `` It's his own thing,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said in the interview. `` I just think you have to have a well-balanced, sensible diet. I'm not one for extremes.'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, who has struggled with diets and poked fun at his own stocky frame, shakes his head in wonderment at the president's ability to be `` a very disciplined eater. `` His whole life is very disciplined. ... He just does n't let himself go. He drinks a glass of wine at lunch for a state official or a visiting dignitary. I do n't think I've ever seen him take a hard drink,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. The spokesman added that he's watched in wonder as <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> will consume a green salad or Jell-O, even if others at the same table are chowing down on a beef <LOCATION> Wellington </LOCATION> _ which happens to be his favorite.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said Wednesday that <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Hearst </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON>'s pardon request `` has n't come to my desk for attention yet'' as a senior official said he did not expect <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to grant `` too extraordinary'' pardons before he leaves office Friday. The president, during a picture-taking session with members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> who were given presidential citizens medals, was asked whether he was going to grant Mrs. <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON>'s plea. `` There are always pardons coming across my desk from the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said. Asked specifically about Mrs. <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON>, convicted for her role in a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> bank robbery 14 years ago, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> replied, `` No, that has n't come to my desk for attention yet.'' The president on Sunday, however, told reporters he had asked aides `` to look into'' Mrs. <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON>'s case. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, `` There are pardons that are in the system, but I do n't have any status report on whether or not he has had a chance to review them.'' A senior official, speaking on condition he not be identified, said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has pardoned 10 people in the last few weeks through the normal process, in which the pardons are announced by the courts rather than by the White House. `` My private guidance is not to expect anything too extraordinary here in the form of pardons,'' the official said. He added, however, that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has not made final decisions. The official said former national security aide <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>, Mrs. <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON> and industrialist <PERSON> Armand </PERSON> <PERSON> Hammer </PERSON> were in the category of potential pardon recipients he had in mind as `` extraordinary.'' With time running out on his two-term presidency, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has `` as many as a couple of dozen'' requests still pending, said another source, who also declined to be named. Mrs. <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON>, 34, said earlier this week that she did not know whether <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> would grant her a pardon. Administration officials would not divulge the names of the 10 pardon requests that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> reviewed and sent back to the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. `` There are no big names,'' one official said. <PERSON> Patty </PERSON> <PERSON> Hearst </PERSON> was sentenced to seven years in a federal prison for her role in the 1974 armed robbery. She now is married and living in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> with her husband and two daughters under the married name of <PERSON> Patty </PERSON> <PERSON> Hearst </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaw </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Shaw </ORGANIZATION>, granddaughter of newspaper tycoon <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Randolph </PERSON> <PERSON> Hearst </PERSON>, asked for the pardon last August. She has maintained that she was brainwashed by the radical <ORGANIZATION> Symbionese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, a group of revolutionaries who kidnapped her in <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, in February 1974, and orchestrated the bank heist. Her seven-year sentence was commuted by President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> and she was released from prison on Feb. 1, 1979, after serving 23 months.

 Azerbaijanis fled 105 Armenian villages prior to the December earthquake because of ethnic strife over <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> that the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> is trying to break by imposing direct rule, a Soviet official said. Premier <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> spent several weeks in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> managing the response to the Dec. 7 quake, and returned Tuesday for a meeting with party officials and economic managers. A report on the meeting was published in Wednesday's <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> newspaper Pravda. The earthquake struck after another flare-up of ethnic violence between Azerbaijanis and Armenians in the southern republics. More than 60 people have been killed in ethnic unrest in the past year, and 200,000 people have fled the violence. Last week, in order to stem the unrest the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> announced it was suspending the legislature of <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>, the region of <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> that <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> wants to annex, and impose direct <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> rule. `` This is a compromise under which a mutually acceptable balance of interests of the two republics is observed,'' <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> said. `` The decision made about <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> is no one's victory and no one's loss. It was dictated solely: to lessen tension in the region, re-establish order, give people the possibility to live, work and raise their children normally,'' he said. Even prior to the earthquake, the <LOCATION> Azerbaijani </LOCATION> population of 105 Armenian villages fled because of the ethnic tension, he said. Now that <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> is trying to rebuild from the quake that killed about 25,000 people, there is an insufficient number of people to organize workers and tend cattle and sheep, he said. <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> and <PERSON> Suren </PERSON> <PERSON> Arutunyan </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief of <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>, both partially blamed Armenian intellectuals for encouraging the drive to annex <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>, which began with demands made by the primarily ethnic Armenian population of the area in February. <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> said positive changes were seen in the mood of <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>, but that in order to heal the wounds left by the violence, changes must continue to take place from the bottom as well as directed by the Kremlin. On Tuesday, Pravda said 49 <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and government officials in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> had been sacked for encouraging nationalism and a variety of other offenses including blackmail. In a separate article Wednesday, Pravda said Y.P. <PERSON> Kochetkov </PERSON> had been replaced as the Armenian party's second secretary by O.I. <PERSON> Lobov </PERSON> and was trasnferred to unspecified other work. It said a member of the Armenian Politburo, F.T. <PERSON> Sarkisyan </PERSON> had retired and his place was taken by Armenian Premier V.S. Markaryants.

 About 5,000 people converged on the city's central Wenceslas Square today chanting `` Freedom!'' `` Truth!'' and `` Human rights!'' in the fourth consecutive day of public dissent. The group also chanted the name of jailed dissident <PERSON> Vaclav </PERSON> <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> and others arrested for taking part in protests in the Czechoslovak capital since Sunday. In a reversal of tactics that drew strong Western criticism, police kept watch on the demonstrators but did not try to disperse them.

 A clotting protein made through genetic engineering appears promising for people with the bleeding disease hemophilia and may provide an AIDS-free alternative to current treatments, researchers report. In a report in Thursday's <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION>, Dr. <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> II and others from the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION> described the first use of the genetically engineered protein in two people. One of them received 44 doses, while the other got 35. The researchers said the treatment appeared to work well. `` We think it will be a blessing _ truly virus-free and truly safe,'' said <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Brownstein </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Hemophilia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>. Hemophiliacs lack a protein, called factor VIII, that is essential for making blood clots. As a result, they frequently suffer internal bleeding and must receive infusions of clotting protein derived from human blood. During the early 1980s, these treatments were often tainted with the AIDS virus. In 1984, after that was discovered, manufacturers began heating factor VIII to kill the virus. The strategy greatly reduced the problem but was not foolproof. However, many experts believe that adding detergents and other refinements to the purification process has made natural factor VIII virtually free of AIDS. To produce clotting protein that is indisputedly free of AIDS and other viruses, the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> researchers inserted the human gene that controls production of factor VIII into animal cells. These cells then made the protein. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hemophilia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> estimates that about 60 percent of the nation's 20,000 hemophiliacs are infected with the virus that causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome. It is not known how many of those people will eventually get the disease. Currently, only about 900 hemophiliacs have been reported to have AIDS _ slightly more than 1 percent of the nation's 83,000 AIDS cases. Among all AIDS virus carriers, about 20 percent and 30 percent can be expected to contract the disease within five years, according to Surgeon General <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Everett </PERSON> <PERSON> Koop </PERSON>. Their longer term prospects are not yet known.

 President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> suffered a stroke at home Wednesday, but was `` clear-minded'' and might appoint a <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> member as acting president, his office said. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>, who turned 73 on Jan. 12, was in stable condition at No. 2 Military Hospital in the <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Wynberg </LOCATION> after suffering a mild stroke, his office said. No further details were released. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>'s health generally has been excellent since he took charge of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s white-run government as prime minister in 1978. Under a new constitution, he became president in 1984. <PERSON> Elize </PERSON> <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>, the president's wife of 46 years, and some of their five children came to the hospital to be with him, state radio said. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> was hospitalized shortly after 8 a.m., according to the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>'s office said he was `` quite clear-minded'' and was likely to appoint one of his <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> ministers as acting president on Thursday According to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s Constitution, the president can appoint a <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> minister to fill in for him temporarily. If the president is incapacitated, the Cabinet can elect one of its members as acting president. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> has refused to comment on his possible retirement. There has been intense speculation, but no consensus, about which <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> member might be selected by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> as <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>'s successor. Among those mentioned as presidential contenders are Foreign Minister <PERSON> Pik </PERSON> <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>, who is not related to him; National Education Minister F.W. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON>; Constitutional Development Minister <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Heunis </PERSON>; Finance Minister <PERSON> Barend </PERSON> <PERSON> du </PERSON> <PERSON> Plessis </PERSON>; and Defense Minister <PERSON> Magnus </PERSON> <PERSON> Malan </PERSON>. None of these men is considered likely to make fundamental changes in current <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> policy, although <PERSON> Pik </PERSON> <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> is viewed as slightly more liberal than the others. The stroke occurred a few days after <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> returned to <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> from a month-long holiday at his coastal vacation home. On Friday, he was to meet members of <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>'s territorial Cabinet to discuss the planned transition to independence by year's end. <PERSON> Pik </PERSON> <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> said he would chair the meeting with the Namibian officials. Parliament is due to open Feb. 3, and there has been widespread speculation that President <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> would announce a general election to take place in late April. <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leaders have suggested the early election because they believe their opponents on both the left and right are in disarray. During his years in power, <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> has maintained the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s political dominance despite criticism both from the anti-apartheid movement and from extreme-right whites. He pushed throught the first significant racial reforms undertaken during the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s 40-year rule, such as legalization of interracial marriages and abolition of pass laws that restricted blacks' movements. But he has refused to negotiate with the <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla movement or to release the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION>'s jailed leader, <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> has said he would not even discuss the possibility of a one-person, one-vote system in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, where the 5 million whites control the government and economy while the 26 million blacks have no vote in national affairs. The <LOCATION> Wynberg </LOCATION> hospital is about a mile from the Constantiaberg Clinic, where <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> spent several weeks recuperating from tuberculosis last year before being transferred to a suburban-style staff home at a prison farm in the wine-growing town of <LOCATION> Paarl </LOCATION>. The hospital in <LOCATION> Wynberg </LOCATION>, part of a military base, is considered one of the best in southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> laid the cornerstone for the main building in 1976, when he was defense minister.

 Secretary of State-designate <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> said today the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> are close to agreement on verification procedures for two long-pending nuclear test ban treaties. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> that when all work on the two treaties is completed they will be submitted to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> for ratification. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, whose confirmation as secretary of state is virtually assured, said he believes verification problems on the 1976 Peaceful Nuclear Explosions Treaty are `` completely resolved.'' And he said verification procedures are `` close to being resolved'' on the 1974 nuclear test ban treaty which would establish a limit of 150 kilotons on underground tests. Testifying on the second day of his confirmation hearings, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> also agreed to a proposal by Sen. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, D-Del., to discuss in private <PERSON> Biden </PERSON>'s ideas on revising and implementing the controversial War Powers Act which provides a mechanism for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to reverse a presidential decision to commit <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces to combat or meet the threat of combat But, declaring that `` I do n't want to pursue this under false colors,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said there are many in government `` who feel very strongly that the War Powers Act is unconstitutional, including the president-elect.'' <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> said failure to try to reach a compromise on the issue will `` lead to an impasse every single time'' a president decides to commit <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces. `` If that's your position, I can assure you there will be no bipartisanship,'' <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> said. But <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> said there may be ways to address the constitutional issues and still leave a voice for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said he would be willing to pursue the matter. On another subject, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration will maintain a high standard of insisting on human rights protection around the world, whether abuses are committed `` by governments of the left or of the right.'' Responding to questions, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said he believes the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> adminiration will move to combat the environmental hazards poised by acid rain in `` a coordinated and responsible way.'' `` I think you'll see a new approach toward acid rain from this administration,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said, noting <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign promises on the issue. He indicated <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will not move precipitously, however, and underscored the need to deal with acid rain `` from a national and international standpoint.'' He told senators: `` You have my commitment to work at the problem, because I think it is a very serious matter.'' In testimony on Tuesday, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> promised regular consultations with congressional leaders and asked for bipartisan support in return. `` In order to succeed we simply must work together,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said Tuesday. `` That is the verdict of history and that is the verdict of recent experience.'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> ended the first of two days of confirmation hearings before the foreign relations panel with the endorsement of virtually every member. Chairman <PERSON> Claiborne </PERSON> <PERSON> Pell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-R.I. </LOCATION>, said the panel will vote on the <LOCATION> Baker </LOCATION> nomination Thursday morning, one day before <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is sworn in as president. The full <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> will act later. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, on Tuesday, used such words as `` prudence,'' `` realism'' and `` caution'' to describe the proper <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attitude to the startling economic and foreign policy changes championed by Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. And he refused to commit the incoming <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration to resuming nuclear arms control talks with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> by any specific date, even though senators repeatedly urged him to do so. One member, Sen. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Biden </PERSON>, D-Del., noted that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> ran for president in large part on his experience in handling foreign policy and arms control issues, contrasting himself favorably with Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> said it appeared odd to him that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> should now contend they need an extended period to review the proper negotiating positions at arms control talks. The START talks on deep cuts in strategic nuclear weapons have been recessed since November, and <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said the new administration's approach to them is among several key policy areas that are `` under review.'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> also said he believed the strategic talks should be pursued on their own merits and not be linked to other issues, including agreement on reducing conventional arms. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should welcome <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms and any positive change in Soviet human rights, foreign policy and defense postures, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. But he cautioned: `` The talk is different, but the force structure and policies that support far-reaching interests and clients have not changed commensurately. Many of those policies and those clients are hostile to <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> values and threaten our interests and our allies. That's a reality.''

<HEAD>Government May Have Acted Hastily to Restrict Co-ops</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Government officials who have ordered cooperatives out of lucrative fields such as medicine and publishing apparently did n't count on the high cost of buying them out, a leader of co-op movement said Wednesday. The Dec. 29 directive of the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministers </ORGANIZATION> ordered some cooperatives to close by Feb. 1. `` Up to now, not one co-op has closed because of the decision, and I do not know of any that show any inclination of ceasing their activity,'' said <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Yakovlev </PERSON>, chairman of the FAKT market research and consulting cooperative. `` If the co-ops are closed, the state will have to pay back all losses due to the decision. I think that the people who decided to close the cooperatives did not calculate concretely how much it would cost the government,'' he told a news conference. The directive ordered medical and publishing coops to close, as well as video salons, which provide snacks and tea to viewers who watch films. It costs between $ 48,000 and $ 80,000 to start a video salon in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, he said. The cost of starting a medical co-op is considerably higher. Medical co-ops and video salons make up only about 6 percent of the cooperatives in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, but the government would be forced to pay out a `` significant'' amount of money to buy them out, <PERSON> Yakovlev </PERSON> said. The directive was based on emotion rather than economics, and by enforcing it the government would contradict its own reform effort, <PERSON> Yakovlev </PERSON> said. Video salons were doing a booming business when the government decided to restrict them, he said, implying that if demand counts for little, economic reform is doomed. `` If the decision of the ministers becomes law, the cooperative movement will not be able to continue,'' <PERSON> Yakovlev </PERSON> said. President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has encouraged development of the cooperative movement in all spheres, although citizens themselves certainly would agree to restrictions regarding ventures that pose a risk to the public. `` The decision is a most unpleasant fact in the history of the cooperative movement,'' he said. Government bureaucrats as well as the general public know little about the economics of the cooperative movement, he said. `` A great deal is said about the negative attitude of the population toward coops. The basis of this attitude is the people's lack of comprehension of the laws of economics According to our statistics, only one out of 10 persons understands how prices are determined in a free market, and I think the decision shows that same lack of comprehension in the ministries and state organizations.'' Cooperatives have no way to influence events, <PERSON> Yakovlev </PERSON> said. To try to remedy their lack of clout, three major co-op associations, each with between 1,000 and 2,500 co-op members, plan to organize a union through which owners hope to be able to elect delegates to legislative bodies.

<HEAD>Police Appeal For Information on Former Prime Minister</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Police on Wednesday made a nationwide appeal for information on the abduction of former Prime Minister <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Vanden </PERSON> <PERSON> Boeynants </PERSON>, and his family expressed fears for his life in an emotional radio message. <PERSON> Vanden </PERSON> <PERSON> Boeynants </PERSON>' son, <PERSON> Christian </PERSON>, said the family has `` received no sign of life of my father up to now.'' `` We have n't had the least contact with the kidnappers and thus, there are no negotiations,'' he said on national <ORGANIZATION> BRT </ORGANIZATION> radio. It was the first public reaction from the family since <PERSON> Vanden </PERSON> <PERSON> Boeynants </PERSON> disappeared Saturday. Authorities considered broadcasting a phone call taped Monday in which a man claiming to represent the <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brigade </ORGANIZATION> said the group was holding the former leader. The caller said the brigade would return <PERSON> Vanden </PERSON> <PERSON> Boeynants </PERSON> `` in little pieces.'' Investigators hope the public might be able to identify the voice. The brigade demanded the equivalent of $ 789,000 in a letter to two newspapers, but did not provide proof it actually held the 69-year-old politician or that he was still alive. Officials have expressed concern about the health of <PERSON> Vanden </PERSON> <PERSON> Boeynants </PERSON>, who needs heart medicine when under stress. `` My mother, my sister and myself are very worried,'' <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> <PERSON> Vanden </PERSON> <PERSON> Boeynants </PERSON> said on the radio. `` Anyone who has information on this subject is asked to contact the coordination center,'' the police appeal said. It was distributed by the national news agency <ORGANIZATION> Belga </ORGANIZATION>. The brigade said in a letter to the <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> newspapers <ORGANIZATION> Le </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Soir </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Het </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laatste </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nieuws </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday that the politician will have to appear before a `` People's Tribunal'' for corruption and alleged misuse of funds and could face the `` supreme'' sanction. <PERSON> Vanden </PERSON> <PERSON> Boeynants </PERSON> received a three-year suspended sentence in 1986 for financial fraud as head of his meat packaging business and is under parliamentary investigation for allegedly accepting bribes as defense minister in the 1970s. The brigade called <PERSON> Vanden </PERSON> <PERSON> Boeynants </PERSON> `` a corrupt person ... who has stolen large public funds for his own profit.'' About 10 claims of responsibilty have been made since <PERSON> Vanden </PERSON> <PERSON> Boeynants </PERSON> disappeared, but in most cases the authenticity was doubtful, said deputy <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> Prosecutor <PERSON> Andre </PERSON> <PERSON> Vandoren </PERSON>. The brigade demanded that two-thirds of the ransom money go to relief agencies. Experts of left-wing terrorism said the group's letter was `` amateurish.'' `` Such poor language would n't be tolerated by groups like the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Faction </ORGANIZATION> ... the Red Brigades or Action Directe,'' said <PERSON> Rudolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Boehm </PERSON>, a professor at <ORGANIZATION> Ghent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Vanden </PERSON> <PERSON> Boeynants </PERSON> disappeared near his home in a posh <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> neighborhood late Saturday. The cover of a syringe found near his home had traces of a tranquilizer. <PERSON> Vanden </PERSON> <PERSON> Boeynants </PERSON> was prime minister from 1966 to 1968 and again from late 1978 until early 1979 and was also defense minister for seven years in the 1970s. He was a <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> city councilor from 1952 until 1985 and was re-elected in October. As Public Works alderman in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>, he razed several old neighborhoods to make way for high-rise buildings, and <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> became known for its destructive urban renewal. The brigade letter named a <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> construction company as one of <PERSON> Vanden </PERSON> <PERSON> Boeynants </PERSON>' business partners who must help contribute funds to the ransom

 <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>, the tough political operator who managed <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s presidential campaign, was elected <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chairman today and he took office with a call for the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> to `` reach into communities where the Republican message has not yet found a home.'' As <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s choice to run the party, the 37-year-old <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolinian </LOCATION> was elected chairman without opposition for a two-year term. He succeeded <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fahrenkopf </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, who served as chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> for six years, the longest tenure in this century. In his speech to the committee, <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> described the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> victories in the last three presidential elections as `` the triumph of an idea. We are heirs to a political movement that offers new hope to millions of Americans.'' The new party chairman said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s victory over Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was `` because we have better ideas and we had the best candidate.'' But he also said the party now must strive to control the redistricting process under which legislative districts, at the state and federal levels, will be redrawn in 1991 to conform to population shifts determined by the 1990 census. <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> said the Republicans also must work to attract minorities, to `` reach into communities where the Republican message has not yet found a home.'' `` We have been fighting with one arm tied behind our back _ because the <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> have succeeded in virtually cornering the votes of whole segments of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> society,'' he said, citing blacks, Hispanics, Asians and the disabled. `` Our program of low taxes and economic growth, of standards in schools and safer streets, has a great appeal to Americans of all colors and backgrounds,'' he said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Vice President-elect <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> appeared briefly at a <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> committee luncheon and the president-elect endorsed <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>'s outreach program. `` I like the concept that our party needs to have a broader base, a stronger participation,'' he said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> `` will be my political eyes and ears. ... I'm here to say I want to work with the party. As he left office, <PERSON> Fahrenkopf </PERSON> also emphasized the need to control the redistricting process and pointed out that in the 1988 election, 98 percent of <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members who sought re-election were victorious. He asked, `` Why is it that today there is more change in the Supreme Soviet of the <LOCATION> U.S.S.R. </LOCATION> than there is in the American House of Representatives?'' <PERSON> Fahrenkopf </PERSON> said according to the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, the Supreme Soviet recently returned 96.1 percent of its members. When <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> designated <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> as his choice to head the committee, he said, `` He's a friend. I'm proud of his accomplishments.'' Political rivals claim <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>'s accomplishments often are tainted by roughhouse tactics. `` He's got a tough-guy image,'' said <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> GOP chairman <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Hipp </PERSON>. `` I think <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> enjoys it to be honest with you.'' For most of the 165 Republican committee members, the meeting was a routine piece of business leading up to the inauguration of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Friday and the round of parties keyed to that event. In recent interviews, <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> said a top priority would be trying to expand the party's appeal to blacks, Hispanics, Asians and the handicapped. While getting 53 percent of the overall vote in the 1988 election and carrying 40 states, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> received only 12 percent of the black vote, according to a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Times-CBS poll. That was marginally better than <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> who attracted the votes of 11 percent of blacks in 1980 and nine percent in 1984. Among Hispanics, the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> total was estimated at about 30 percent, down from <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s totals of 35 percent in 1980 and 37 percent in 1984. <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> paid tribute to <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> recently as `` an American hero.'' The incoming <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> chairman was <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s representative at ceremonies marking King's birthday at the <ORGANIZATION> Ebenezer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> where the late civil rights leader was pastor. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> used similar language when he spoke at a prayer breakfast Monday, the national holiday marking King's birth. The president-elect said King `` lived a hero's life. He dreamed a hero's imagination of a great nation.'' A private panel called the <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> issued a report Tuesday that criticized the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration for `` a complete breakdown'' of endorsement of civil rights laws. Chairman <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Flemming </PERSON> said the group was sending its report to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` in the hope that he can turn around the'80s as far as civil rights enforcement is concerned.''

 It costs a pretty penny to ride in style around the nation's capital this inaugural week, and even wealthy would-be power travelers may find themselves hailing taxicabs if they procrastinate. Limousine operators report capacity or near-capacity bookings for the week. One has switched its phones over to an answering service, whose operators deliver the news: `` They are booked solid.'' Those fortunate enough to find a limousine are paying to keep it at their disposal. Because of demand, most Washington-area companies are leasing on a three - or four-day basis, with the car and chauffeur on call eight to 10 hours each day The cost: $ 2,700 at <ORGANIZATION> Presidential </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Limousine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. There is an alternative package, referred to among the in-crowd as `` sans stretch.'' Translation: For $ 1,600 one can rent a car and driver for four days, but the car will be a <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Town </ORGANIZATION> Car sedan, not the stretch limousine that comes with the pricier deal. Some companies are charging more; some a bit less. `` It's really a seller's market,'' said Presidential's <PERSON> Herta </PERSON> <PERSON> Mullens </PERSON>. Some would-be clients have special requests. `` A lot have asked for bodyguards,'' said <PERSON> Mullens </PERSON>. `` We call it executive protection, but they're essentially bodyguards.'' High rollers who do n't need a limo for four days but want a classy ride to a single event may find it tough to find one. But, not surprisingly, where there's a wallet, there's a way. `` If they are willing to pay the price, no one will go home unhappy,'' <PERSON> Mullens </PERSON> said. `` With a little shuffling I can get someone from their hotel to a ball for $ 1,000.'' The ball-bound appear undeterred by the cost. `` They pause for a while when they hear the price,'' said <PERSON> Mullens </PERSON>, `` and then say ` OK, put me down.'''

 Many of the high-powered Republicans who came to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to see <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> become president evidently were a bit hesitant about his chances _ until the pollsters told them to relax and reserve. All 240 rooms and suites at the capital's plush Ritz-Carlton are booked, including one offered as part of a $ 15,000 inaugural package the hotel proudly boasted included `` the most expensive hotel room in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>.'' But bookings were slow for a while. Hotel spokeswoman <PERSON> Vivian </PERSON> <PERSON> Deuschl </PERSON> said the pace of reservations for the inaugural appeared tied to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s lead in the pre-election polls. `` Every time <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> went up in the polls we got more phone calls,'' Ms. <PERSON> Deuschl </PERSON> said. `` Then, when everybody was saying it was all over we started getting requests for room blocks.'' By Election Day, the <PERSON> Ritz </PERSON> was booked for inaugural week. The least expensive room is $ 290 a night, with a four-night minimum this week. Those lucky enough to land a suite pay between $ 800 and $ 1,200 a night. Among the <ORGANIZATION> Ritz </ORGANIZATION>'s registered guests is real estate mogul <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>, who apparently signed up for the four-night minimum although he plans to spend just two nights in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, arriving Thursday, attending the swearing-in ceremony Friday and one of the balls that night.

 Tuxedos and tacos may seem an odd mix, but the hands-down winner as the most-sought after ticket in town is a ducat for a <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> black-tie affair with a Tex-Mex menu. The 5,500 tickets to the Saturday night Black Tie and Boots Ball sold out in less than 24 hours, sales fueled by speculation the new president will show up to salute his adopted home state. The tickets sold for $ 50, well below the $ 1,500 charged for some of the fancier inaugural dinners.

<HEAD>Sri Lankan Forcibly Taken Away After Two Years In Church</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANCHESTER, England (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Police burst into a church vestry Wednesday and dragged away a Sri Lankan seeking political asylum, an action one critic called an `` act of savagery'' against the ancient right to sanctuary. <PERSON> Viraj </PERSON> <PERSON> Mendis </PERSON>, an activist who says he fears persecution or death if he returns home, had handcuffed himself to a radiator when 16 police and two immigration agents broke into the Church of the Ascension in the rundown <PERSON> Hulme </PERSON> district, police said. Police cut <PERSON> Mendis </PERSON>' handcuffs with acetylene torches, and a witness said the 32-year-old screamed `` Murderers! Murderers!'' as they took him to a <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> prison to await deportation, scheduled for Friday. Officials said <PERSON> Mendis </PERSON>, who had been living in the church since receiving a deportation order two years ago, would be sent home unless a third country accepted him. `` The fact that someone is in a church does not give them any immunity from the law,'' Home Secretary <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurd </PERSON> told a noisy session of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. Some opposition lawmakers shouted `` Sieg heil!'' and `` KGB!'' Three spectators, one shouting `` Do not send him to his death!'' were thrown out of the public gallery. But other politicians cheered as <PERSON> Hurd </PERSON>, the minister responsible for immigration affairs, warned the church to `` think carefully before it enters into any habit or custom of giving shelter to those defying the law.'' Home Office Minister <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Renton </PERSON> said the government `` always felt that the situation in <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> did not justify the position that <PERSON> Mendis </PERSON> and his supporters were adopting.'' <PERSON> Mendis </PERSON>, a member of his nation's Sinhalese majority, says his life is threatened by his political activism on behalf of communism and the Tamil minority. He came to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> in 1973 as a student. His supporters said <PERSON> Mendis </PERSON>' removal from the church violated his rights and endangered his life. About 200 people marched in protest in this northern <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> city. Under English common law, a person accused of committing a crime could take sanctuary in a church but had to surrender or leave the country in 40 days. The provision was abolished in 1623, but <PERSON> Mendis </PERSON>' supporters used the ancient right as a last resort to argue his case `` People seeking sanctuary like this have never been dealt with like this, by violence, before,'' said opposition <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> legislator <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Vaz </PERSON>. `` As a Christian I say it is an act of savagery which is a disgrace.'' The human rights group <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> told <ORGANIZATION> Hurd </ORGANIZATION> that <PERSON> Mendis </PERSON> `` would be at risk of torture or ill treatment, arrest and prolonged detention without charge'' if he returned home. An advisory body to the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> issued a statement that did not mention <PERSON> Mendis </PERSON>, but said `` asylum seekers from <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> should not be sent back'' because of ethnic strife. The Committee for Community Relations of the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bishops </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION>, headed by Bishop <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> McCartie </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION>, said the situation in <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> is `` now so serious that governments should clearly risk erring on the side of caution lest lives be necessarily be lost. <PERSON> Mendis </PERSON>' lawyer, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Burgess </PERSON>, said his client also feared Sinhalese groups fighting Tamil demands for an independent state. <PERSON> Chandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Monerawela </PERSON>, the Sri Lankan high commissioner to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, said `` <PERSON> Mendis </PERSON> is an unknown entity in <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> _ he is not wanted for any criminal or civil offense.'' <PERSON> Burgess </PERSON> said he will challenge the deportation in the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION>, although his client already has lost two immigration appeals. Last month, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s highest court, the Law Lords, refused to hear the case. The Rev. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Methuen </PERSON>, the vicar whose church gave <PERSON> Mendis </PERSON> asylum, said police broke into his home, cut telephone and burglar alarm wires, and smashed in the door of the vestry where <PERSON> Mendis </PERSON> slept. `` There is quite a lot of damage to the building,'' he said. Church council member <PERSON> Ingrid </PERSON> <PERSON> Falat </PERSON> said police cut <PERSON> Mendis </PERSON> free and carried him away. Greater Manchester Assistant Chief Constable <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>, however, described the operation as `` low-key'' and denied that police had cut telephone or alarm wires. He offered to repair the damaged doors. <LOCATION> Methuen </LOCATION> and the bishop of <PERSON> Hulme </PERSON>, the Rt. Rev. <PERSON> Colin </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>, said the government's action will jeopardize <PERSON> Mendis </PERSON>' chances of getting asylum outside <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>.

 Turkish police have arrested the alleged organizer of an operation in which peasants were paid to donate kidneys for transplant recipients at a private <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> hospital, a newspaper reported Wednesday. The Independent said the peasants were offered the equivalent of $ 3,540 to donate one of their kidneys, and traveled to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> for the operations. It said police in <LOCATION> Istanbul </LOCATION> arrested <PERSON> Tunc </PERSON> <PERSON> Kunter </PERSON> on Tuesday and charged him with cheating people out of body organs. <PERSON> Kunter </PERSON> admitted running the operation but said he was motivated by a sense of humanity, not profit, the newspaper reported.

 <PERSON> Frances </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hsin-Yi </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> have spent two weeks shuttling between lawyers' offices, the prosecutors office and a hospital where their son, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, is in a coma from cyanide-poisoning. Their lives have been subject to microscopic scrutiny _ investigators have even rifled through their kitchen garbage _ and their telephone rings incessantly. `` This is a real nightmare for an otherwise private family,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Nagele </PERSON>, a family friend. `` But now every aspect of their life has been made very public.'' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, 17, a junior at <ORGANIZATION> Haddonfield </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, has been in critical condition and on life-support machinery at <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital-Voorhees </LOCATION> since Jan. 3, when he ate black cherry yogurt laced with cyanide. On Thursday a guardian appointed to represent <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>' welfare must file court papers over whether his life-support machines should be disconnected. Hospital officials have painted a dismal picture of his chances of recovery. Police have not ruled out attempted homicide or suicide. But they say one thing is almost certain: The yogurt package was not tampered with at the factory or the store. The Lees have adamantly insisted in statements released through attorneys that their son would not have tried to kill himself, and that he was too popular to be the target of a slaying. <LOCATION> Camden </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Prosecutor <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Asbell </PERSON> said last week the boy's parents and brother were not targets of the investigation into how the cyanide got into the carton of yogurt But family members were fingerprinted this week and two <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents fingerprinted <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> at the hospital Saturday, said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerns </PERSON>, a spokesman for <PERSON> Asbell </PERSON>. <PERSON> Kerns </PERSON> said investigators wanted the fingerprints for comparison to items taken from the <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> home and the father's laboratory at <ORGANIZATION> Rutgers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Camden </LOCATION>, where he is chairman of the biology department. <PERSON> Asbell </PERSON> declined to describe the items under investigation, but the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> has said a tiny plastic vial of cyanide was found at the Lee home. <PERSON> Asbell </PERSON> has declined to confirm or deny whether cyanide was found at the elder <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>'s laboratory. In the meantime, <PERSON> Nagele </PERSON>, a former student of <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> and now professor of pediatrics at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION> and Dentistry of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Camden </LOCATION>, has tried to shield the family from reporters. `` They deserve a little peace,'' he said. `` People are forgetting that <PERSON> Tommy </PERSON>'s still on life support. Their thoughts should be with him.'' `` They're just heart-broken,'' said attorney <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>. `` I think they're experiencing what any parents would experience upon such a tragedy.'' <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, 53, came to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> in 1961 and earned his doctorate from the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION>. He became a professor at <ORGANIZATION> Rutgers </ORGANIZATION> in 1968 and is recognized as an expert on early brain development. `` Students are always trying to beat down the door to get in his lab,'' said <PERSON> Nagele </PERSON>, who worked in <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>'s lab for five years and is currently collaborating with him on a number of projects. Outside of his work, <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> has few hobbies or pastimes. His wife, <PERSON> Frances </PERSON>, also a Taiwanese immigrant who holds a master's degree in immunology from <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION>, has primarily been a homemaker since the birth of <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>. `` They have done the best over the years, to the point of spoiling their boys,'' said <PERSON> Nagele </PERSON>. `` They were very devoted to their children.'' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>' brother, <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON>, 20, is a student at <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` They were always together,'' <PERSON> Nagele </PERSON> said. `` There was no direct competition.''

<HEAD>Audit Finds Slipshod Control Involving Chemicals in Meat and Poultry</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DON KENDALL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Farm Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An internal audit by the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> says that federal control of illegally high traces of pesticides and other chemicals in the nation's meat and poultry supply has been slipshod and sometimes ineffective. The investigators found that in some cases meat and poultry containing too much of these chemical residues slipped through and got into the consumer pipeline. `` Even when animals were presented to inspectors, -LRB- agency -RRB- administrative controls and current policies did not ensure timely and effective response when pesticide residue was suspected or found in meat and poultry products,'' the report said. `` As a result, some adulterated products were allowed to enter commerce.'' The report by the department's Office of Inspector General said the department's inspection agency _ the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inspection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, or <ORGANIZATION> FSIS </ORGANIZATION> _ has little authority to prevent pesticide residues from showing up in meat and poultry. Accordingly, the <ORGANIZATION> FSIS </ORGANIZATION> has turned to the food industry itself for cooperation in monitoring levels of chemicals and ferreting out violations. The agency's chief responsibility is to ensure that USDA-inspected meat and poultry products are safe, wholesome and free of adulterating chemicals. As part of its responsibility, the agency samples and analyzes edible tissues to see if they meet the federal standards. But the system is far from foolproof, and the agency also includes efforts to enlighten farmers and processors about the federal standards and how to comply with them. The report, which was completed last November but not given wide distribution by the department, said <ORGANIZATION> FSIS </ORGANIZATION> was `` unable to successfully investigate pesticide violations in 79 percent of the cases'' reviewed by the auditors. A violation was defined as an illegal level of chemical residue found in a sample of meat or poultry. Some of the reasons for the lack of success in investigating violations included: _ Tracing the illegal residue to the original producer was not always successful _ Follow-up samples from suspected meat were seldom taken, or else the suspected animals or carcasses were not always retained for further checking _ Documentation of regulatory actions was insufficient Starting in June 1986, when a company signed a memorandum of understanding with <ORGANIZATION> FSIS </ORGANIZATION>, it agreed to upgrade its own quality control procedures, was exempted from routine monitoring by the agency and placed under a less-intensive monitoring program. `` In addition, these companies became eligible to make certain claims on their product labels concerning -LRB- chemical -RRB- residue levels or superior quality control procedures,'' the report said. By 1988, this `` verified production control'' program included 11 companies and 34 slaughter plants out of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> total of 1,800 plants. The participating plants had an annual slaughter of about 5 billion pounds, or about 8 percent of all animals slaughtered last year. In all, the agency is responsible for inspection in more than 7,000 meat and poultry slaughter and processing plants. The <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> investigators visited 96 federally inspected meat and poultry plants and conducted research at the agency's national office, three regional offices, three field laboratories and five USDA-accredited laboratories. One of the major problems uncovered is the identification of the original farmer, feedlot operator or other producer of livestock that have been found to be in violation of the federal residue levels. The report recommended that the agency seek legislation for mandatory identification of the source of all animal species slaughter for domestic food consumption. However, <ORGANIZATION> FSIS </ORGANIZATION> responded that such a move be directed to policy-makers, not the regulatory agency itself. <PERSON> Lester </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> FSIS </ORGANIZATION> administrator, said that historically the agency has pursued animal identification as a related part of the residue testing program. `` We recently were successful in obtaining a swine identification program outside of the legislative route, and would strongly support similar identification for the other species which come under our jurisdiction,'' <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON> said in a response to the report.

 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> moved out of his vice presidential mansion and closer to the White House today, lightheartedly joking about `` big responsibilities being put on my shoulders'' as the countdown to his inauguration officially got underway. The man who said he wanted to be the education president started the day by vowing to make good on his promise. `` Education will be on my desk and on my mind right from the start, every day,'' he said in a speech to 250 teachers summoned from each state for the inauguration. The teachers were nominated by home-state officials to represent the best from <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s schools. `` My most important message to <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> teachers is a message of appreciation,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` I am awed by your work.'' In a bow to the political operation that helped him win the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also planned to oversee the installation of his campaign manager, <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>, as chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. He used the occasion _ a gathering of 500 <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> officials from around the country _ to pay tribute to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. `` I do n't believe I'd be standing here as president-elect of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> if it had n't been for the way President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> treated me as vice president and then the way he rolled up his sleeves and went to work in many of your states helping his vice president be elected. `` When I go say farewell to him tomorrow,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` it wo n't be too easy. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will be sworn in as the nation's 41st president at 11:59 a.m. EST Friday, but the five-day celebration of his inauguration begins today with an outdoor twilight pageant at the Lincoln Memorial, complete with herald trumpets, fireworks and a flyover of <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> combat jets. As inaugural guests flooded into hotels, building to an estimated 300,000 celebrants, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and his wife <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> moved out of the official residence they've occupied for the last eight years on the grounds of the <ORGANIZATION> Naval </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Observatory </ORGANIZATION> off <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Avenue </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> joked that he had been giving his wife `` a little elbow room'' during the chaos of the move. `` She's getting tough around the house,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` See a half-filled crate and she puts me to work and she's mean and tough and ugly about it. She does n't show any understanding. And so she's not here today. `` I do n't care if I see her for another 48 hours, because I know there'll be another crate that she -LRB- will say -RRB-: ` Move this one over here.' Getting tired of that. After all I got big responsibilities being put on my shoulders,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said to gusts of laughter from the crowd of Republican officials. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s temporary home, until he goes to the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> on Friday, is the <ORGANIZATION> Blair </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, the newly refurbished government guest quarters across the street from 1600 <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Avenue </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s aides say the move will allow workers time to prepare the vice president's residence for its new occupants, <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> and his family, who will move in next month after renovations. The president-elect and his wife will not be lonely at <ORGANIZATION> Blair </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>. Their five grown children and their spouses, along with 10 grandchildren, also were moving into the guest house. The whole clan _ 22 in all _ will live together and then move en masse to the <LOCATION> White </LOCATION> <LOCATION> House </LOCATION> on Friday where they'll all spend at least one night. About 100,000 people were expected for the opening ceremony at the Lincoln Memorial, and the city was braced for traffic problems in the evening rush hour. The first 40,000 celebrants were to receive tiny flashlights with instructions to turn them on at one point to highlight <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign theme of `` a thousand points of light.'' The most exclusive social event of the whole inaugural was tonight's black-tie inaugural dinner, with tickets priced at $ 1,500 a plate. Yet, the demand was so heavy that organizers had to split it up into three dinners at different sites, all being attended by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. Advocates of the poor and homeless were staging a counter-inaugural banquet at one of the dinner sites in protest of the pricey tickets. <PERSON> Mitch </PERSON> <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON>, an activist for the poor, challenged corporations that are underwriting the cost of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s inauguration to contribute like amounts to house the homeless Amid the swirl of events, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> arranged a Blair House reunion with World War II submarine crewmen who rescued him after the Japanese downed his bomber in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> in 1944. He also was working to fill out high-level jobs in his administration. Industry and Republican sources said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> planned to name <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Engeleiter </PERSON>, 36, a <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> state senator who lost the race for a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> seat last November, as head of the <ORGANIZATION> Small </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> met quietly on Tuesday with leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> union, which is the target of a <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> lawsuit alleging that it is infiltrated by organized crime. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> aides said the meeting, which was not listed on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s schedule, was a thank-you for the union's endorsement in the election, and that the lawsuit was not discussed.

 The nation's soon-to-be first family crammed into a government guesthouse Wednesday as some 230 of <PERSON> George </PERSON> and <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s closest relatives, aflutter with excitement, took over an intimate hotel festooned with flags and bunting. `` Is n't it something,'' marveled one family member as she checked into the flower-filled <ORGANIZATION> Jefferson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hotel </ORGANIZATION>, with its vaulted ceiling, damask-covered love seats and imposing portrait of <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Jefferson </PERSON>. `` I've been laughing and crying all day.'' The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s brothers, sisters, uncles, aunts, nieces, nephews and cousins are occupying 90 of the hotel's 100 rooms this week. As they arrived, weighed down with furs and formal wear, some of them scheduled manicure and makeup appointments even before checking in. In addition to all the official glamour and pomp, the relatives are throwing a few parties of their own. The family reunion will culminate with a White House lunch for 250 relatives on Saturday, the first full day the new president and first lady will spend in their new home. The nomadic couple, billed as having moved 28 times in a 44-year marriage, wo n't make their 29th move until Friday after <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has taken his oath of office. And their personal belongings are n't due to arrive at the White House until Monday. But they left the vice presidential residence Wednesday for a two-day transitional stay in <ORGANIZATION> Blair </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, the government's quarters for visiting dignitaries. `` Our house looks like yours do whenever you make a move,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told a group of teachers, referring to the official residence on the grounds of the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Naval Observatory. `` It's a real wasteland out there this morning.'' <ORGANIZATION> Blair </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, four connected rowhouses across <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> Avenue from the White House, is designed to house 19 guests. The Bushes will number 22, counting children, spouses, grandchildren and the president-elect's mother <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON>, 87. The whole crew will move to the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> with the first couple on Friday and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s mother, only the 12th presidential mom to see her son sworn in, will sleep in the Queen's Bedroom. <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> personally packed hundreds of boxes and decided which belongings would go to the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, which to Camp David, which to the summer house in <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION> and which into storage. `` We've got dots on everything,'' she told reporters last week, referring to her system denoting which items are going where. The move had been exciting but also `` agony,'' she said, `` maybe because I'm tired.'' Despite the two moves in the space of a week, `` I do n't see that they look at it as a strain,'' said <PERSON> Sondra </PERSON> <PERSON> Haley </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` They wanted to be with their family and there was no way the vice president's residence could accomodate everybody.'' Vice President-elect <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, his wife <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> and their three children are expected to move into the official residence early next month. Renovations for the young family are not expected to be complete by then, but the <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> is anxious to install them there as soon as possible. They ca n't compete with the Bushes, but the Quayles are no slouches in the relative department. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> put the latest count at 117 coming for the inauguration. `` I think some of them, we asked for their birth certificates,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> joked. `` They started calling up and saying ` I am a relative of the senator' and I said, ` Oh?' So we were going to have a genealogist check their birth certificate and the tree and all that. `` But no,'' he added hastily, `` we'll be glad to see them all.'' According to <PERSON> Haley </PERSON>, the 200-plus <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> relatives are people the president-elect and his wife have been in touch with over the years, and many have been guests at the family's summer home in <LOCATION> Kennebunkport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>. `` We get enormous strength from our family,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said during her session with reporters. `` Not just our children and granchildren, but our brothers and sisters. It's always been like that. And more so now.''

 The nationally syndicated `` <PERSON> Sally </PERSON> <PERSON> Jessy </PERSON> <PERSON> Raphael </PERSON>'' talk show may leave New Haven for a new haven. WTNH-TV Station Manager <PERSON> Lew </PERSON> <PERSON> Freifield </PERSON> said Tuesday that discussions had been held about relocating the show closer to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> because of travel problems for <PERSON> Raphael </PERSON>, who lives in <LOCATION> Westchester </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. The talk show, shown on more than 90 stations nationwide, has been taped at the downtown New Haven television station since June 1987. <PERSON> Raphael </PERSON>'s weekly commute from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> was a major reason for the show's relocation to New Haven from KSDK-TV in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>. The show's executive producer, <PERSON> Burt </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubrow </PERSON>, would not say why the show is considering the move. But he denied it was because of the hour-plus commute <PERSON> Raphael </PERSON> must make, and he discounted reports of space, parking and audience problems at the <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> affiliate. <PERSON> Dubrow </PERSON> said the show is merely `` exploring all kinds of options'' that might be available when its contract to lease space and production services from <ORGANIZATION> WTNH </ORGANIZATION> expires in June 1990. <PERSON> Dubrow </PERSON> and <PERSON> Freifield </PERSON> would not rule out a move before 1990.

 The bullet-proof shield to protect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> when he takes the presidential oath of office Friday is in place. The manhole covers along the parade route are welded shut. Virtually every police agency in town has canceled all days off. Welcome to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the inaugural city, where protestors are ready to demonstrate for their own version of a `` kinder, gentler'' nation and authorities hope they're ready for whatever transpires. `` We intend to be everywhere,'' <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Fithian </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the Counter-Inaugural Coalition for a <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agenda </ORGANIZATION>, told a news conference Wednesday. `` We will be a reminder of the urgency of not just a kinder, gentler nation but a kinder, gentler, less insulated government.'' But she said the coalition's 80 groups _ ranging from the <ORGANIZATION> Student </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Against </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Apartheid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Racism </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> to </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> _ have agreed not to conduct any civil disobedience. Anyone going anywhere the first families might go will be checked with metal detectors. That includes, for the first time, the 150,000 invited guests at the Capitol swearing-in ceremonies, even if they'll be sitting hundreds of yards away. That bit of security has upset Sen. <PERSON> Wendell </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>, D-Ky., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Inaugural Ceremonies `` Security is something that bothers me considerably,'' he said Tuesday. `` We're a free and open nation insisting that those in the inner circle go through megadetectors.'' The west side of the Capitol, where <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will take the oath, has been secured for a week. Starting tonight, the Capitol itself will be off-limits to all unauthorized people. Friday, all streets within a two-block radius will be closed, with even members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> told not to use their normal parking spaces on the Capitol grounds. Many security details remained secret even as the celebrations got under way Wednesday. `` We certainly would n't want to give anyone who had harmful intent any kind of advantage,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON>. Reports on previous inaugurations have indicated that agents carrying shoulder-fired Stinger missiles to protect against air attack were on the Capitol roof. The agencies involved refused to say if that would be the case this year, although <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Buckhorn </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> noted that flying over the White House or the Capitol is normally a violation of federal air regulations. Flying over those places during the inauguration `` would be an extreme, gross violation,'' <PERSON> Buckhorn </PERSON> said. `` The Secret Service frowns on those kinds of violations.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will ride in an armored limousine along the parade route from the Capitol to the White House after he takes the oath, according to everyone willing to talk about it. But then, that's what all they said about President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> before he and his wife, <PERSON> Rosalynn </PERSON>, climbed out of their car and walked the 1 -LCB- miles down <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> Avenue in January 1977. <PERSON> Jody </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>, <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>'s press secretary, said in a recent interview that his boss told him about his plans a week before the inauguration but that the news was `` very tightly held, for security purposes.'' `` What he told me at the time was the deal was the <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> was n't going to fight it as long as it was kept secret, but if word got out ahead of time they'd be very opposed to it,'' <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> said. The Secret Service will be ready to protect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> if he, too, decides to stroll down the parade route, says spokesman <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>. But he admitted the agents would not be too happy about it. `` If we had our way, he would not leave the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said. Even from the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, the new president will be able to see protestors. A corner of <LOCATION> Lafayette </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, across <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> Avenue from <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s new home, has been set aside for demonstrations `` to ensure First Amendment rights,'' in the words of Park Police Capt. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Barrett </PERSON>. Planning to protest along the parade route are the <ORGANIZATION> Counter-Inaugural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> and its member groups as well as the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION>, which has announced a silent protest. Law enforcement agencies involved in security for the inaugural ceremonies include the <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Capitol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> police department, <ORGANIZATION> Metro </ORGANIZATION> transit police, <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protective </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>.

 Energy Secretary <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Herrington </PERSON> today officially named <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> as the site of the $ 5.9 billion superconducting super collider project. `` <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> has been chosen as the site because it is the superior site,'' <PERSON> Herrington </PERSON> told a ceremony at the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> attended by <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Clements </PERSON>. <PERSON> Herrington </PERSON> had already declared, on Nov. 10, that <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> was the `` preferred site'' for the massive physics installation at which scientists plan to explore the nature of matter and energy. The facility is to be called the <ORGANIZATION> Ronald </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reagan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> for High-Energy Physics. Despite protests from states that lost out in bids for the project, <PERSON> Herrington </PERSON> signed a `` record of decision'' making the choice official. The collider, a 53-mile tunnel in which subatomic particles can be accelerated to high speeds, is to be built around the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Waxahachie </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Herrington </PERSON>'s decision to make the <LOCATION> Ellis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> site official had to wait 30 days following release of the <ORGANIZATION> DOE </ORGANIZATION>'s final environmental impact statement for the seven finalist states. Completion of that statement hinged on the choice of a preferred site. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> must still authorize construction of the super collider and members are predicting a tough battle over funding this year. Democratic Sens. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> are among those who have requested the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> to review the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s site selection process and determine if the decision was based on politics over merit. <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Maynes </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> report is expected sometime in February. `` We knew realistically our best hope for evaluating the DOE decision was by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and not the administration. Our best hope for a check on the process lies in the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> report and action by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to send the decision back to the drawing board,'' said <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Carle </PERSON>. Last year, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> agreed to spend $ 100 million on the super collider, but decreed that none of the money be spent on construction. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s budget for the next fiscal year recommends $ 250 million for the collider, $ 90 million of that for research and development and $ 160 million for initial construction. But President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has not yet indicated whether he will go along with the $ 250 million figure or if he favors authorizing construction.

 The mayor has been swamped with calls from angry viewers of the television movie about AIDS victim <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, he said Wednesday. `` They've been calling giving us thunder,'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sargent </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Sargent </PERSON> has received calls from as far away as <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, questioning him about the actions portrayed in `` The Ryan White Story.'' The movie, broadcast Monday night on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>, starred <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>, <PERSON> Judith </PERSON> <PERSON> Light </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lukas </PERSON> <PERSON> Haas </PERSON>. It told the saga of White, a hemophiliac who was barred from classes at <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Middle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in nearby <LOCATION> Russiaville </LOCATION> after he was diagnosed as having acquired immune deficiency syndrome in December 1984. <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> and his family successfully took the school corporation to court. They won another legal battle when some of his classmates' parents tried to get an injunction keeping him out of school The movie also depicted the harassment allegedly suffered by the Whites during their legal struggle. Some <LOCATION> Kokomo </LOCATION> residents complained Tuesday that the movie left the impression that their entire community was against <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> and his family. <PERSON> Sargent </PERSON> said many of the viewers who called his office also got that impression. `` They wanted to know why we'd do what we did to <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>,'' he said. `` I talked to each one and I think I turned a few heads.'' <PERSON> Sargent </PERSON>, who was not mayor at the time of the dispute, said he told the callers that many in the community _ including the local ministerial alliance, newspaper editors and health officials _ had supported <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>'s return to classes. <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>, who is now 17, returned to school in 1986. He has since moved to <LOCATION> Cicero </LOCATION> and attends <ORGANIZATION> Hamilton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> A.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nielsen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> estimated that 15 million viewers saw the movie.

 Stunned elementary school students returned to classes today, one day after a young drifter with a rifle opened fire on a schoolyard jammed with laughing children, killing five and wounding 30 before committing suicide. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Purdy </PERSON>, wearing a military flak jacket and earplugs, killed himself with a bullet to the head after firing up to 110 rounds from a Soviet-designed AK-47 assault rifle at hundreds of youngsters on recess Tuesday at <ORGANIZATION> Cleveland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. The five slain were children of refugees from <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Purdy </PERSON>, who had a long criminal record, attended the school from kindergarten through third grade, from 1969 to 1973, school officials said today. There was no apparent motive in the shootings. As children returned to their campus today, they were greeted by bouquets atop the school sign on the front lawn and five red roses at its base. Across the street, a 3-foot-by-9-foot paper sign read, `` Racists Are Ugly _ Let's Stop Them.'' There was no indication that racism was involved in the attack. `` I'm shocked. It's just horrible,'' said <PERSON> Purdy </PERSON>'s grandmother, 63-year-old <PERSON> Julia </PERSON> <PERSON> Chumbley </PERSON> of nearby <LOCATION> Lodi </LOCATION>. `` I do n't understand why and I probably wo n't ever know why.'' <PERSON> Purdy </PERSON>, 26, who most recently listed his grandmother's address as home, began his assault shortly before noon when he parked his station wagon behind the school. The car burst into flames in a fire possibly set as a diversion, said Deputy Police Chief <PERSON> Lucian </PERSON> <PERSON> Neely </PERSON>. Then the 5-foot-11, 140-pound killer entered the campus through a hole in a fence with the bayonet-equipped semi-automatic and two handguns and walked to several portable classrooms about 250 yards from the main, L-shaped building. He opened fire from the west side of the portable buildings, then moved to the east side and continued spraying the screaming children before turning his 9mm handgun on himself. Police Capt. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> said the gunman wore a flak jacket and jeans. On his shirt were the words, `` Death to the great Satin,'' an apparent reference to Satan and a phrase used by Iranian fundamentalists to refer to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> was trying to determine if <PERSON> Purdy </PERSON> had a military background. During a search of <PERSON> Purdy </PERSON>'s motel room, police found about 100 plastic toy soldiers, tanks and jeeps spread across the floor in formations, <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> said. `` Obviously he had a military hangup of some kind,'' <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzales </PERSON>, superintendent of the <ORGANIZATION> Stockton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unified </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION>, said psychiatrists, counselors and bilingual volunteers wearing yellow armbands were on hand when classes began this morning. `` The main focus of our efforts is going to be on counseling,'' she said on <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>' ` This Morning.'' `` He was just standing there with a gun, making wide sweeps,'' recalled <PERSON> Lori </PERSON> <PERSON> Mackey </PERSON>, who teaches deaf students in one of the portable classrooms at the school about 80 miles southeast of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. `` He was not talking, he was not yelling, he was very straight-faced, it did not look like he was really angry,'' she said. `` It was just matter-of-factly. `` There was mass chaos. There were kids running in every direction.'' <PERSON> Purdy </PERSON>, who also was known as <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> West </PERSON> and <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Purdy </PERSON> <PERSON> West </PERSON>, had an `` extensive criminal record,'' said <PERSON> Neely </PERSON>. Many of the crimes were committed in the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> area and included soliciting for sex and narcotics and weapons violations, <PERSON> Neely </PERSON> said. The dead children were shot in the schoolyard and two were dragged inside by fleeing teachers, he said. As police cleaned up the carnage, a large handgun and the assault rifle were seen lying on the ground near a pool of blood. Written on the pistol's handle was the word `` Victory.'' The letters <ORGANIZATION> SSA </ORGANIZATION> were printed on the rifle's clip in letters 1 -LCB- inches long. Police said the word `` Hezbollah,'' the name of a Shiite Moslem terrorist organization, was carved on one side of <PERSON> Purdy </PERSON>'s rifle, and the word `` Freedom'' on the other, <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> said. `` It suggests that this guy may have had delusions of grandeur about <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> said. Th assault rifle <PERSON> Purdy </PERSON> used apparently was purchased in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> in August, authorities said. It is a Soviet design, but Chinese replicas are available in many gun stores for around $ 300. It is capable of firing about 40 rounds per minute. A semi-automatic rifle can be purchased easily in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, without even the five-day waiting period required for a handgun, if the buyer signs a federal form stating he has never been convicted of a serious crime or indicted, among other requirements, said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Imel </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Salem </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, gun shop owner. `` You use it for one purpose and one purpose only _ to kill a human being,'' said <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> Police Lt. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>. The torched car was registered to <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Purdy </PERSON>, who lived with an aunt and uncle from July through October in <LOCATION> Sandy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION> `` She told me he was a loner and as a child he was an alcoholic,'' <PERSON> Sandy </PERSON> Police Chief <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Punzel </PERSON> said of his conversation with the aunt, <PERSON> Julie </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON>. <PERSON> Punzel </PERSON> said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> told him <PERSON> Purdy </PERSON> left <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> for a job as a boilermaker in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. That job fell through and he went to <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Tenn </PERSON>. The aunt and uncle last heard from him at Thanksgiving, when he was in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Punzel </PERSON> said. `` He seemed like a real nice young man,'' said next-door neighbor <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, 45, who met <PERSON> Purdy </PERSON> in <PERSON> Sandy </PERSON> last summer. `` He was here looking for work.'' <PERSON> Purdy </PERSON>'s father, <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Purdy </PERSON>, was a <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veteran who was killed in a traffic accident in September 1981. <PERSON> Purdy </PERSON>'s parents married in <LOCATION> Stockton </LOCATION>; they later were divorced and his mother retained custody. <PERSON> Purdy </PERSON> began drifting about 10 years ago, criss-crossing the nation looking for work, his grandmother said. He visited her occasionally and used her address to receive mail. <PERSON> Neely </PERSON> identified the dead students as Raphanar Or, 9, a boy; and girls <PERSON> Ram </PERSON> <PERSON> Chun </PERSON>, 8; <PERSON> Thuy </PERSON> <PERSON> Tran </PERSON>, 6, Sokhim An, 6, and <PERSON> Oeun </PERSON> <PERSON> Lim </PERSON>, 8. All were children of refugee families from <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. Southeast Asian pupils make up about 60 percent of the school's enrollment of 1,000 pupils in grades kindergarten through 6th grade. The wounded included 29 pupils. The most seriously injured was a 6-year-old boy who was shot in the groin. He was listed in serious condition; a teacher and 17 pupils were listed as stable, hospital officials said Tuesday night. The others either were treated at the scene or at hospitals and released. Pupil <PERSON> Ramon </PERSON> <PERSON> Billedo </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> described seeing a schoolmate shot. `` I just saw him fall down,'' he said. `` His head hit the ground. The teacher grabbed him and dragged him inside the other classroom.'' `` Some kids were outsideand some man came over here shooting like crazy. A few kids got shot,'' said <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON>, 10, a fifth-grader. `` They were shooting at my classroom and at -LRB- <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON>'s -RRB- classroom at reading time,'' said another pupil, <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Costa </PERSON>. `` The bullets were hitting the walls. Everybody got scared.'' Tragically, schools have been frequent targets of similar attacks. On Sept. 26, a man walked into <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Greenwood </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, and opened fire in a crowded cafeteria and in a third-grade classroom. Two 8-year-old girls were killed, and nine people were wounded. <PERSON> Jamie </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, 19, was charged with murder and is in jail awaiting trial. On May 20, <PERSON> Laurie </PERSON> <PERSON> Dann </PERSON> attacked the <ORGANIZATION> Hubbard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Woods </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> school in <LOCATION> Winnetka </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, killing one 8-year-old boy and wounding five children. <PERSON> Dann </PERSON> fled to a nearby home, wounding a man inside and shooting herself to death.

<TEXT>
 Prison inmates have no right to challenge or have explained to them prohibitions on having visitors, a lawyer for <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>'s prison system told the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Wednesday. A decision to bar visitors is one of the `` daily management problems'' prison officials deal with that do not give rise to any special rights for inmates, state lawyer <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Willett </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Frankfort </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, argued. But <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Elder </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION> lawyer representing inmates, contended that <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>'s prison visitation program created a `` liberty interest'' for inmates that can not be infringed on without due process. `` The right arises out of ... regulations in place,'' Elder said. The high court is expected to announce a decision in the case by July. Its ruling likely will affect prison visitation policies in many states. Thirty-two other states are supporting <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>'s appeal, urging the justices to clarify what rights, if any, inmates have in such cases. A federal appeals court ruled for the inmates, but did not say what kind of due process _ perhaps a written explanation or some type of hearing _ is required when visits are prohibited. The <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> controversy dates back to a lawsuit inmates of the <ORGANIZATION> Kentucky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reformatory </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> LaGrange </LOCATION> filed over conditions there. The suit resulted in a 1980 consent decree in which the state agreed, among other things, to continue its `` open visitation policy.'' State officials subsequently adopted guidelines and procedures for handling prison visits. In 1985, after several inmates complained about being barred from having visitors, a class-action lawsuit was filed in behalf of all the prison's inmates. The suit contended that suspension of visitation privileges without a due-process hearing was unlawful. Mrs. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> asked the justices to `` draw a line between those procedures which affect the daily operations of a prison from those which affect the length or nature of confinement'' when requiring states to give inmates due process. She said denial of visitation privileges does not rise to the level of affecting length or nature of confinement _ and therefore should not give rise to any due-process right. Several members of the high court seemed dubious. Justice <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>, noting that some might say seeing visitors `` is vitally important to a prisoner's existence,'' said the distinction Mrs. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> sought `` is not an easy line to draw.'' Chief Justice <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON> complained that `` your line seems so wavy,'' and Justice <PERSON> Antonin </PERSON> <PERSON> Scalia </PERSON> asked, `` Is it a line that makes any sense?'' When Justice <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> asked whether providing inmates with a written explanation for denied visitation would be a big administrative burden, Mrs. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said it would not. But she said creation of such a due-process right would leave all prison officials open to civil rights lawsuits alleging violation of that right. The case is <ORGANIZATION> Kentucky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corrections </ORGANIZATION> vs. <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, 87-1815.

<TEXT>
 Housing Secretary-designate <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> pledged Wednesday to `` throw out ideology'' and be an advocate for helping ease poverty, homelessness and other urban problems. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> won praise from big-city mayors in his first public appearance before them since his selection by President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as secretary of Housing and Urban Development. `` I am going to be an activist,'' <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> said. `` I'm going to be an advocate. The door is open. My mind is open.'' He spoke to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mayors </ORGANIZATION> as the group held its annual winter meeting in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. He promised to visit many of their cities and to meet again with the organization once he is confirmed by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, a conservative who unsuccessfully sought the Republican presidential nomination, drew applause from the mayors when he described himself as `` a bleeding heart conservative'' and `` a progressive conservative.'' `` I'm going to throw the labels out. We're going to throw out ideology,'' he said. He added, `` I want to be considered a big-L liberal'' on race, poverty, and relations between mayors and his department. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> referred briefly to federal budget constraints but spoke enthusiastically about working with the mayors, whose complaints about cuts in federal aid to cities have been a constant refrain during the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. He also noted his support for tax cuts that some critics blame for cutbacks in domestic spending. `` I've long been associated with the tax reform, but it went to far when it comes to affordable low - and moderate-income housing,'' <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> said `` But I'm speaking for <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> now. I'm not speaking for the administration.'' <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> cited his support for urban enterprize zones, which encourage jobs and development in targeted inner cities with tax breaks and other incentives. He listened as mayors described problems in their cities caused by a shortage of affordable housing and cuts in federal housing aid and other programs. `` I want you to know from the bottom of my heart I am really excited about this, and I have a mandate from the president-elect to pursue many of the things you've mentioned,'' he said. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> was widely praised by the mayors, who have had only limited meetings with the <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> secretary throughout <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s two terms, <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>. <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> was not scheduled to have a farewell meeting with the mayors during their three-day meeting. `` This is the type of enthusiasm we have waited for for a long time,'' said Mayor <PERSON> Jessie </PERSON> <PERSON> Ratley </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Newport </LOCATION> <LOCATION> News </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION> `` We have prayed for it.''

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Roman Catholicism's social-service arm, <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Charities </ORGANIZATION>, on Wednesday launched a system of raising money to help the needy through credit cards. The plan is called `` Project Caritas,'' Latin for generous love. Half of 1 percent of the amount charged on a specially endorsed `` Caritas Mastercard'' credit card will be channeled by participating banks to the church's work among the deprived. The Rev. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, executive director of <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Charities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION>, called it a `` creative way'' of bolstering efforts at `` lessening human suffering.'' `` It will help us in our mission of protecting human dignity,'' he said. The plan was described at a news conference as the first of its kind by a major national religious organization. However, other non-profit groups, devoted to such causes as the environment, college alumni associations or higher education, also participate in such `` affinity'' credit card programs. Officials at the news conference said the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Synagogue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Youth </ORGANIZATION> also has begun such a program, and others are being considered by the <ORGANIZATION> Salvation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Young </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Men </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Charities </ORGANIZATION> embraces a nationwide network of branches helping about 7 million people annually at a cost of about $ 1 billion. Auxiliary Bishop <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>, representing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bishops, termed the new plan a `` very responsible way'' to raise money and to `` get the message out'' of aid to the homeless, hungry, sick, children and other needy. <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> estimated that at least 20,000 people would use the new card the first year, increasing to 250,000 in five years, when it would funnel an estimated $ 4 million a year into church charities. That estimate was based on the average annual spending per card of $ l ,800 The `` Caritas Mastercard'' is being marketed by a bankcard organization, <ORGANIZATION> Magna </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, of <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, with two issuing banks: <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Milwaukee </ORGANIZATION>. `` We're pleased to be involved with this kind of project,'' said <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> institution. `` It should have mass appeal because of the purpose that it goes for.'' <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> emphasized that the church did n't want to promote `` credit dependency'' and would not benefit from interest on deferred payment of charges. `` We are not encouraging debt,'' he said. Noting that <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> charities serve the needy without regard to creed with 75 percent of help going to non-Catholics, he said the card was being promoted ecumenically among `` all people of good will.'' Returns from the card program are to be divided 30 percent locally, 30 percent nationally for training leadership, and 40 percent for work among troubled youth and AIDS victims.

 <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> had the `` killer rabbit'' to contend with and <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> was perceived as prone to bumping his head on helicopter doors. But after all these years, the two former presidents say they do n't know why they got such lousy press. `` Presidents <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>, <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> and I had bad relations with the press. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had good relations,'' said <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> on Wednesday. `` Why, I do n't know.'' <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> took part in a discussion at <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> on `` The Press, the Presidency and the First Hundred Days.'' They agreed that when it comes to relations with the news media, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will find <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> a hard act to follow. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was treated with kid gloves by the press, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> said. And <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> thinks <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> got away with staying aloof from tough issues _ `` a tribute to his acuity.'' <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said he had unsuccessful relationships with the press. He said he spent weeks trying to deflect attention from a story that a rabbit had swum out to his boat as he was fishing and that he had to beat it back with oars. `` How can you control something like that?'' <PERSON> Cartr </PERSON> asked. The rabbit story, he said, `` gave an image of an incompetent president who could not even protect himself against a rabbit.'' He said that <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> `` was the best athlete ever in the White House'' but that <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> was dogged by stories about his golf balls hitting bystanders and his clumsiness generally. `` It hurt him politically,'' <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> said news people who accompanied him on ski trips to <LOCATION> Vail </LOCATION> fell as much on the slopes as he did `` but nobody took pictures of them.'' The images are hurtful, he said, but `` it's part of what they think the public wants.'' <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> said that when <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> takes the oath of office this week he will start out with the best atmosphere, since relations between the press and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in recent weeks have been pleasant.

 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Sleeman </PERSON>, the kingpin in what is considered the most widespread case of public corruption in <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> history, was sentenced Wednesday to a minimum of two years in jail. Judge <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> McCaffrey </PERSON> sentenced the former <LOCATION> Bennington </LOCATION> school superintendent to jail terms of three to seven years on each count, the terms to be served concurrently, with a minimum of two years behind bars. <PERSON> Sleeman </PERSON>, 58, was convicted last fall of eight counts of embezzlement and one count of false swearing, all stemming from allegations he used school money for personal uses. <PERSON> McCaffrey </PERSON> ordered <PERSON> Sleeman </PERSON> to make $ 8,425 in restitution and to perform 1,000 hours of community service. Prosecutors had urged <PERSON> McCaffrey </PERSON> to give <PERSON> Sleeman </PERSON> five to 10 years in jail, while <PERSON> Sleeman </PERSON>'s lawyer argued for no jail term, saying his client had suffered enough. <PERSON> Sleeman </PERSON> was convicted of embezzling $ 4,285 in rent checks from two school bank accounts for building space he leased, and of lying about the rent checks during a February 1986 inquest into the <LOCATION> Bennington </LOCATION> school scandal. His conviction came in the first of four trials he faces on a series of charges that were prompted by the discovery in 1984 of a $ 2 million deficit in the <ORGANIZATION> Bennington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION>. In all, <PERSON> Sleeman </PERSON> is charged with embezzling $ 20,000 and a car. He has yet to be tried on 21 embezzlement counts and three counts of false swearing stemming from state inquests in which he allegedly lied about his use of school funds. Four former top-ranking school officials have been punished for their part in the scandal, though none has received jail time.

<HEAD>GAO Says Pentagon Has Ambitious Schedule for Rail Garrison System</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DONNA CASSATA</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has an ambitious schedule for developing a rail garrison system for the MX missile, according to a congressional agency report that says there could be cost and performance problems if the program is not closely supervised. The <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, an investigating arm of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, said in a report this week that the department's acquisition strategy for the rail garrison system calls for the start of production two years before development contracts have been completed. This overlap between production and development, known as concurrency, must be `` well planned and controlled,'' the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said, otherwise, `` it can cause cost, schedule and performance problems, as demonstrated in other <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> acquisition programs.'' In addition, the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said that by March 1990, when the department must make an initial production decision on the rail garrison, only about two years of the system's planned four-year test program will have been completed. `` Most systems integration testing, all basing verification missile flight tests, and most of the operational test and evaluation effort will remain to be done,'' said the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, in comments included in the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> report, concurred with all of the agency's findings. It added that the department believes the system of launching missiles from the rails is similar to silo launches and does not require special tests. Under the rail garrison system, 50 missiles would be placed on 25 trains that would be parked inside train alert shelters in garrisons at <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> bases around the country. In the event of a threat, the trains, each carrying two missiles, would move onto the nation's railroad tracks The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> estimates that acquisition cost for the rail garrison system is about $ 7.4 billion. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> approved $ 440 million for research and development of the rail garrison program in fiscal 1987 and 1988, and appropriated $ 600 million in fiscal 1989. However, the Pentagon can only spend $ 250 million on the MX rail garrison before Feb. 15, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> authorization bill for fiscal 1989. The Feb. 15 date is the deadline for the president to decide what to do with the remainder of the funds. Under the system, the trains will be deployed initially at F.E. <ORGANIZATION> Warren </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, and at up to 10 other possible <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> installations.

 A wandering rooster that was picked up as a fowl-at-large and served time in the pen has been adopted and will star on a radio show.

The <ORGANIZATION> Metro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> auctioned off the bird Tuesday to cover the costs of the dog food it ate.

<TEXT>
 As a prologue to the broader governmental change to occur on Friday, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s team took power Wednesday at the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> with the election of tough infighter <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> as party chairman. `` He will be my political eyes and ears,'' said the president-elect during a brief appearance at a Republican luncheon shortly after <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>'s election. With ties to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> that go back to 1973 when the president-elect was party chairman, <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> appeared certain to shift political influence from the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> staff to the party headquarters across town. During <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s presidency, political decisions were made by such <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aides as <PERSON> Lyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Nofziger </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Rollins </PERSON>. After his unanimous election to the chairmanship, <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> RNC </ORGANIZATION> that <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> must begin `` reaching into communities where the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> message has not yet found a home. `` Face it: We have been fighting with one arm tied behind our back _ because the <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> have succeeded in virtually cornering the votes of whole segments of American society.'' <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> said blacks, Hispanics, Asians and disabled Americans `` have not historically been part of our coalition'' and added, `` we must invite these Americans into our party's councils.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> endorsed the idea, saying, `` I like the concept that our party needs to have a broader base, a stronger participation.'' <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> made their appeals to a 165-member body that, according to a <ORGANIZATION> RNC </ORGANIZATION> aide, has only two black members, both from the <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>. Vice President-elect <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> referred to <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>'s reputation as a tough political gut-fighter and, joking, said the new chairman was `` tough, tenacious, a real fighter. He'll fit right in making this party kinder and gentler.'' Also speaking briefly was former New Hampshire Gov. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s choice for White House chief of staff. <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON> said, `` I come to this job from outside the -LRB- <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> -RRB- Beltway. ... There are some who consider that an impediment. I accept their judgment in that respect. I will do my best to learn what I have to do as chief of staff.'' But, he went on to say that his experience outside the Beltway gave him a better sense of `` the critical nature of the political structures back home.'' <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>'s predecessor, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fahrenkopf </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, held the chairmanship for six years, the longest tenure this century. His parting message emphasized the need for Republicans to control the process by which legislative district lines will be redrawn, on the state and federal level, to conform with population shifts determined in the 1990 Census. In 1981, Republicans sought to control redistricting with a heavy investment in computers. But Democrats controlled more governorships and state legislatures and they won the day. The same situation threatens to occur in 1991 unless Republican overcome the current Democratic edge in state politics. <PERSON> Fahrenkopf </PERSON> pointed out that 98 percent <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> incumbents running for re-election in 1988 were victorious _ a return rate he said was higher than that for members of the Supreme Soviet. But the part of <PERSON> Fahrenkopf </PERSON>'s speech that drew the most attention from committee members was his outline of the arrangements to getting members to various events connected with the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> inauguration. `` I remind you,'' he told them `` there is no food at inaugural balls. This is not a dinner, folks.''

 East-bloc foreign ministers at a forum on human rights Wednesday defended the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall, <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>'s crackdown on dissent and <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>'s suggestion it may not abide by the 35-nation accord Polish and Hungarian officials promised greater freedom in their nations, but envoys of other countries in the Soviet-led <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact stuck to positions that long have divided East and West. The human rights agreement calls for greater freedom of religion, travel and emigration for East-bloc citizens. It also mandates new arms control talks, beginning March 9, between <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact to reduce the number of troops and tanks in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Foreign ministers of the nations involved in the accord are in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> for the concluding session of the conference, which began in 1986. Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> brushed off suggestions that the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall be torn down as a gesture of socialist commitment to the freer movement called for in the accord. He said the wall was not a subject for the <ORGANIZATION> Vienna </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> on Security and Cooperation in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Jaromir </PERSON> <PERSON> Johanes </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, in a speech, rebutted Western denunciations of the way authorities in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> have put down recent demonstrations. `` Anyone in this hall who wants to point the finger at other nations, including <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, should first of all look at himself,'' <PERSON> Johanes </PERSON> said. He later mentioned the racial unrest in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> as the kind of problem troubling other nations. On Tuesday, riot police in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> broke up crowds for the third straight day and chased hundreds of youths with water cannons and truncheons. Authorities used tear gas, batons, dogs and water cannons to disperse 5,000 demonstrators who gathered Sunday to remember <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Palach </PERSON>, a Czech student who burned himself to death in January 1969 to protest the Soviet-led invasion of his homeland five months earlier. `` What is happening in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> is not a violation of human rights,'' <PERSON> Johanes </PERSON> said in an interview with Austrian radio. Human rights activists in the East German city of <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION> also were arrested over the weekend after they tried to stage a protest. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> and <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> Foreign Secretary <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Howe </PERSON> on Tuesday denounced the crackdowns. In a speech Wednesday, West German Foreign Minister <PERSON> Hans-Dietrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> said that what had `` occurred in the last few days against peaceful demonstrators in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Leipzig </LOCATION> can not be allowed to be repeated.'' Foreign Ministers <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Varkonyi </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Tadeusz </PERSON> <PERSON> Olechowski </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> said their governments will work to ensure the provisions of the accord are carried out. `` We shall review the existing legislation to see whether it is consistent with these new recommendations and, where it is not, to introduce the necessary amendments,'' <PERSON> Olechowski </PERSON> said. `` We shall expect similar moves by other states.'' <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>, however, has drawn criticism from Western nations for suggesting that it did not necessarily feel bound by the accord. `` Some of the provisions in the final document which have been introduced in the name of concern for free movement or personal religious freedoms depart from the ... realities and needs of our times,'' said Foreign Minister <PERSON> Ioan </PERSON> <PERSON> Totu </PERSON>. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> praised the accord as a sign of `` a qualitatively new situation in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>,'' but repeated the socialist bloc's position that the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Wall and other borders are matters of national sovereignty `` Each state has the right to build its frontiers as it wishes, and we must proceed from there,'' he said.

The cease-fire resolution calls on both countries to halt all military activities; withdraw their troops to the border; exchange about 100,000 war prisoners; and begin peace talks. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> still occupies 259 square miles of Iranian territory and says it will not withdraw until <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> gives up the right to search ships for war cargo bound for <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>. It considers that a military activity. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, which has not stopped any Iraqi-bound ships since the cease-fire began, says the withdrawal to the border must be the next step in the peace process. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials and diplomats, speaking on condition of anonymity, did not foresee the likelihood of <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> budging from those positions but said progress was possible on the exchange of sick or injured POWs and other technical measures. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> recently allowed the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> to begin direct flights between the two nations, a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> official said. Previously, the two nations distrusted each other so intensely that even <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> diplomats had to fly to a third country to travel between them. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> has also received `` expressions of interest'' from both sides in resuming the exchange of POWS, the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> official said. Last year, the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> worked out a plan for the registration of all POWs and the exchange of sick or injured POWs, but the arrangement broke down after only a few dozen had been exchanged. A <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> official said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> appear ready to initiate direct contacts between their military officers to work out their frequent complaints about technical violations of the cease-fire and other military matters. `` We hope to achieve movement, some sense of progress'' he said, speaking on condition of anonymity. He also hoped for progress on substantial issues, including the impasse over the <LOCATION> Shatt-al-Arab </LOCATION> waterway forming the border between <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, but noted `` these are matters of deeper pride.'' <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> shared use of the Shatt-al-Arab under a 1975 treaty. It is <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s only deep-water access to the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has repudiated the treaty and said another accord should be worked out under which the two nations would share use of the waterway. It suggested the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> oversee the dredging of the <LOCATION> Shatt-al-Arab </LOCATION>, but <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has refused to go along with that unless <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> recognizes the 1975 treaty.

 A brother of one of three voting rights workers killed in <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> in 1964 is unhappy with the re-enactment of the slayings in the film `` Mississippi Burning.'' `` The movie is terribly dishonest and very racist,'' said <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwerner </PERSON>, whose brother <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> was one of the victims. `` It terribly distorts the realities of 1964.'' The executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advancement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colored </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> agreed. `` Mississippi Burning'' rewrites history and `` reeks with dishonesty, deception and fraud,'' <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hooks </PERSON> said in a statement issued Wednesday from <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>. `` Blacks in the film are portrayed as cowed, submissive and blank-faced. They are used as a backdrop when in reality they were the principals. This is a gross libel on the many black Mississippians who, even knowing they could be murdered with impunity and nothing would ever be done, still sought time and time again the right to vote,'' <PERSON> Hooks </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Schwerner </PERSON>, 51, dean of students at <ORGANIZATION> Antioch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in this southwest <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> community, said Tuesday he is less concerned about the historical accuracy of the movie than he is about its depictions of blacks and federal officials. He said the movie portrays blacks as passive spectators in the civil rights movement in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> as a champion of civil rights. `` In general, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> was an enemy of the civil rights movement,'' said <PERSON> Schwerner </PERSON>, who was a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Racial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Equality </ORGANIZATION> and active in civil rights demonstrations in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and during his college days in Yellow Springs. `` They had to be dragged into the case kicking and screaming by <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, and only then because two of the victims were white,'' <PERSON> Schwerner </PERSON> said. Hooks said it was unconscionable to depict the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> as the good guys. `` Under <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Edgar </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoover </PERSON>, who despised blacks and despised most expecially Dr. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> was not a friend of blacks, but an enemy who spied on the movement and was not above using its own bag of dirty tricks. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwerner </PERSON>, <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodman </PERSON> and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Chaney </PERSON> disappeared in <LOCATION> Neshoba </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miss. </LOCATION>, after they were arrested and jailed briefly for speeding on June 21, 1964, while they were trying to gather information on a church bombing. Their bodies were found buried in an earthen dam about two months later. Seven people, including a deputy sheriff, were convicted of conspiracy charges in connection with the slayings. The movie's director, <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>, has emphasized that `` Mississippi Burning'' is fiction. But <PERSON> Schwerner </PERSON> said so many details of the film are factual _ even down to the <PERSON> Ku </PERSON> <PERSON> Klux </PERSON> <PERSON> Klan </PERSON> nickname for his brother, `` Goatee'' _ that the distinction between fact and fiction is intentionally blurred. And that makes the larger distortions that much more disturbing, he said. `` There are black kids and white kids who are going to see that movie and will walk out believing that the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> was the moving force behind the civil rights movement and behind the destruction of the <ORGANIZATION> KKK </ORGANIZATION>, and that's just grossly dishonest,'' <PERSON> Schwerner </PERSON> said. `` It's like reading in some history books that all blacks were perfectly happy on slave plantations. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> secretly tapped <PERSON> Schwerner </PERSON>'s parents' phone following his brother's disappearance at the age of 24, he said. Through the Freedom of Information Act, <PERSON> Schwerner </PERSON> recently obtained a copy of a letter from <LOCATION> Hoover </LOCATION> to Attorney General <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> requesting the wiretap, <PERSON> Schwerner </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Hoover </PERSON> suspected the disappearances may have been a hoax and publicity stunt, he said.

 About 5,000 people filled Wenceslas Square again Wednesday chanting `` Freedom!'' `` Truth!'' and `` Human rights!'' but police did not disperse the crowd as they had for the past three days. The demonstrators chanted the names of dissident playwright <PERSON> Vaclav </PERSON> <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> and others jailed for taking part in demonstrations that began Sunday in memory of <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Palach </PERSON>. The 20-year-old student burned himself alive Jan. 16, 1969, to protest the Soviet-led invasion of the previous August that ended the the liberal `` Prague Spring'' reforms of <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON>, then <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader. Police used water cannons, tear gas, dogs and truncheons on crowds in the historic central square Sunday, Monday and Tuesday, drawing severe criticism from Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> and other Western leaders. On Wednesday, riot police kept watch on the demonstrators but did not try to disperse them. Demonstrators began assembling in the square about 5 p.m., attracting thousands of onlookers homeward bound from work. Chants of `` Gorbachev!'' `` Dubcek!'' `` Do n't lie!'' and `` Free Havel!'' rose from the crowd. <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> was one of 14 activists detained Monday when they appeared at the square for the second day in a row to honor <PERSON> Palach </PERSON> by laying flowers at the statue of King Wenceslas, where <PERSON> Palach </PERSON> set himself afire. Many in the crowd shouted `` There's a handful of us here!'' to mock official claims that the demonstrations involved only a few anti-communist provocateurs. Some urged bystanders to join the demonstration and called out: `` Come back tomorrow!'' About 2,000 people remained after an hour, clustered around the statue of the king. They left after singing the national anthem, and by 7 p.m. police had cordoned off the statue to discourage further demonstrations. Earlier Wednesday, the official news agency <ORGANIZATION> CTK </ORGANIZATION> said the defense and security committees of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> heard a report from Interior Minister <PERSON> Frantisek </PERSON> <PERSON> Kincl </PERSON> `` on measures aimed at preserving order in the last days, especially in the capital.'' `` As elected representatives of the people, the -LRB- deputies -RRB- expressed full support and appreciation to the police and <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Militia </ORGANIZATION> for their resolute action and effort to maintain order and prevent unrest,'' the agency said `` Resolute legal action'' should be taken against organizers of unrest, the parliamentary committees said, according to the <ORGANIZATION> CTK </ORGANIZATION> dispatch. The news agency and the evening TV news said the education and culture committees asked the public `` to isolate these hooligans.''

<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government on Wednesday again changed its position on when it knew about a suspected chemical weapons plant in <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, and opposition lawmakers shouted their disapproval in Parliament. The latest switch came amid accusations by the opposition that the government tried to cover up alleged involvement by West German companies in the Libyan project. <PERSON> Wolfgang </PERSON> <PERSON> Schaeuble </PERSON>, Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s chief of staff, delivered a long address in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> defending the government's actions <PERSON> Schaeuble </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> informed West German officials May 18 about possible German involvement in the Libyan plant. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> alleges the plant was intended to produce chemical weapons. <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> says it will produce pharmaceuticals. The May 15 date is five months earlier than what the government acknowledged Monday and six months earlier than the Nov. 15 date West German leaders mentioned three weeks ago. Opposition lawmakers shouted and hooted during the speech. When the scandal first broke three weeks ago, West German leaders angrily denied <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> allegations German firms were involved in the plant. They also denied having any knowledge the complex may be intended for production of chemical weapons. <PERSON> Norbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gansel </PERSON>, a lawmaker with the opposition Social Democrats, spoke after <PERSON> Schaeuble </PERSON> and criticized the government's handling of the growing scandal, which has led to criminal investigations into two West German companies. `` The question is, what you knew and what you did about it,'' <PERSON> Gansel </PERSON> said. He added, `` You, <PERSON> Herr </PERSON> <PERSON> Chancellor </PERSON>, are politically and personally responsible that the German and international public were deceived for a long time.'' Officials have said the government did not immediately say what it knew because that would have jeopardized West German investigations. <PERSON> Schaeuble </PERSON> told lawmakers that in August 1987, the West German <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> received information the plant `` in all probability'' was intended for producing chemical weapons. He said at the time there was no evidence of West German involvement in the plant. <PERSON> Schaeuble </PERSON> also said that `` on the basis of intelligence reports, we must assume that this plant in <LOCATION> Rabta </LOCATION> is intended to produce chemical weapons.'' On Tuesday, chief government spokesman <PERSON> Friedhelm </PERSON> <PERSON> Ost </PERSON> refused to say whether <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> had evidence backing the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> charges about the plant. According to <PERSON> Schaeuble </PERSON>, `` new reports'' by the <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> German </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> `` gave clear indications of involvement by German companies'' in the Libyan factory. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> received his first `` comprehensive'' report on the suspicions Oct. 20, <PERSON> Schaeuble </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Schaeuble </PERSON> also provided new information about West German investigations into the affair. He said that on Dec. 14, West German investigators met with an `` informant'' who gave them documents indicating involvement by the German firm Imhausen-Chemie in the Libyan plant. According to <PERSON> Schaeuble </PERSON>, the informant said other documents could be obtained from I.B.I. Engineering, a now-defunct company that was based in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>. Criminal investigations have been launched against <ORGANIZATION> Imhausen </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> I.B.I. </ORGANIZATION>, which allegedly organized participation by German firms in the Libyan plant. The criminal investigations began as a result of a Jan. 4 seizure of I.B.I. documents, <PERSON> Schaeuble </PERSON> said. He rejected any suggestion West German authorities had tried to cover up the affair. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> was present during the debate but did not speak. According to a government spokesman, <PERSON> Schaeuble </PERSON> delivered the speech because it was a matter of protocol.

 <LOCATION> PORT-AU-PRINCE </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ Schools and businesses reopened Wednesday after a strike paralyzed the country, and organizers said the work stoppage showed that Haitians `` want to turn a new page in history.'' Tuesday's strike was called by the <ORGANIZATION> Autonomous </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Haitian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>'s largest and most radical union. It halted public transport and closed businesses and schools in main provincial towns and downtown <LOCATION> Port-au-Prince </LOCATION>. The union wants <LOCATION> Haitian </LOCATION> leader Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Prosper </PERSON> <PERSON> Avril </PERSON> to purge his government of supporters of former dictator <PERSON> Jean-Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON>, who fled the country in 1986. They also want the daily minimum wage of $ 3 raised to $ 7 and a decrease in food and fuel prices. `` The strike revealed the profound frustrations of the people,'' said human rights activist <PERSON> Jean-Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Bajeux </PERSON>. `` The Haitian people have not only shown the military government that they want change but that they want to prove it, to prove to the whole world that they want to turn a new page in history,'' <PERSON> Jean-Auguste </PERSON> <PERSON> Mesyeux </PERSON>, co-leader of the union, said on <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Haiti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inter </ORGANIZATION>, an independent station. State-run <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nationale </ORGANIZATION> reported it `` was not a general strike'' but that activity had merely slowed in the capital. The network did not cover the strike in provincial towns. The strike had been declared illegal by <PERSON> Avril </PERSON>, who came to power Sept. 17 in a coup led by rank-and-file soldiers who said they were fed up with state-sponsored violence. They overthrew Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Henri </PERSON> <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON>, the military leader who came to power after <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON> fled. Friends continued searching Wednesday for two leftist activists reported missing Monday night in a slum neighborhood. The two had set out to distribute leaflets against inflation when they disappeared, <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Haiti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inter </ORGANIZATION> reported. They were identified as <PERSON> Vesner </PERSON> <PERSON> Jean-Francois </PERSON> and <PERSON> Roland </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON>, members of a leftist umbrella group known as the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organizations </ORGANIZATION>.

 President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> Tae-woo called Wednesday for an early settlement of negotiations on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military bases in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, and he urged people not to criticize the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Government officials said the president called for his administration to seek a `` quiet and quick settlement'' over the relocation of the facilities from central <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> to rural areas. In <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION>, 180 miles south of <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, radical students yelling anti-American slogans and wielding sledgehammers and steel pipes attacked a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government cultural center and tried to burn down the building, police said. About 50 attackers hurled firebombs and rocks at the building after rushing through the gates, and some protesters climbed onto the roof and tried to start the fire, according to authorities there. `` Drive out <ORGANIZATION> Yankee </ORGANIZATION> imperialists!'' the attackers chanted. There were no reports of injuries. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>'s directive came at a meeting called to review <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s foreign policy for the coming year The <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> bases occupy valuable land that South Korean officials and developers want to use to meet growing demands for new offices and homes. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> cautioned against any `` emotional criticism'' of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, referring to an expansion of anti-U.S. sentiment among the <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> people, <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> officials said. `` We must work to establish a mature and solid partnership with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> was quoted as saying. Dissidents and radicals have been demanding the withdrawal of the 42,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops based here. They contend the American forces prevent unification with <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> government strongly supports the presence of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials say American forces will remain in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> as long as most South Koreans want them. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> said Tuesday that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> forces will remain until real peace has been established on the divided <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> peninsula. Talks are under way between <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> officials to consider the relocation of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> barracks and the transfer of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> operational control over South Korean troops. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have indicated they are ready to remove military bases from <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> if <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> provides comparable facilities elsewhere. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> also wants the Status of Forces Agreement revised to give <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> more jurisdiction over <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soldiers. The 1966 pact, which defines the legal status of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops, has been criticized for favoring Americans in criminal and other matters. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops have been based in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> since 1950 to help defend the nation against communist <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, which invaded the South in 1950. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> officials agree political and economic changes have caused <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> to reassess its relationship with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, a close ally since the division of the <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> peninsula. <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> was split into the communist North and the capitalist South in 1945, when <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet troops ended <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s colonial rule at the end of World War II.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s penchant for spontanaiety is raising speculation about whether he might just decide to hop out of his armored limousine Friday for a bit of inaugural parade handshaking. While there is no word from the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> camp on whether he might decide to work the sidewalk crowds, the <ORGANIZATION> Secret </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> is fully prepared with protection for whatever fancy might strike him, said spokesman Special Agent <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>. `` We would be derelict in our duty if we were n't prepared for that,'' he said. `` The possibility always exists ... He's the president and we're there to provide security.'' However, <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said he has no information on whether <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will decide to get out of the brand new 1989 Ford <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON> town car. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would n't be the first president to walk in his own parade. <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> got out of his limousine in 1977 and walked hand in hand with his wife <PERSON> Rosalynn </PERSON> for much of the distance down <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> Avenue. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> did not follow suit in 1981, remaining inside his car. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s black limousine, which is being used for the first time, has a bit less window area than <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s did, so that people will have less chance of glimpsing him inside. Both before and since his Nov. 8 election, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has set a style that is much more spontaneous than <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s. He likes to dine spur-of-the-moment at local restaurants and has turned up a local clothing or specialty shops. During the campaign <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would occasionally stop his motorcade to chat with farmers in their fields or schoolchildren by the road. On one occasion a rural restaurant got word that he might stop for a meal and the proprietors became irate when he instead walked into a mom-and-pop store next door and bought a couple slices of pizza to go.

<TEXT>
 A trail-blazing Soviet magazine and its editor-in-chief came under fire from the two most prominent newspapers Wednesday, with one printing a letter that denounced the weekly as `` scum'' bent on defaming Soviet history. Under President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, the magazine <ORGANIZATION> Ogonyok </ORGANIZATION> and its chief, <PERSON> Vitaly </PERSON> <PERSON> Korotich </PERSON>, have become widely known and increasingly controversial. Many of the sensational revelations made by Soviet media under <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policy of `` glasnost,'' or greater openness, have appeared in <LOCATION> Ogonyok </LOCATION>. In this week's issue, the slick magazine with more 3 million subscribers nationwide revealed Soviet suicide statistics for recent years, denounced pollution and ran the latest episode of an expose on corruption and cronyism under the late leader <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>. Seven prominent cultural figures, in a letter to the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> daily newspaper Pravda, bitterly attacked <PERSON> Ogonyok </PERSON>, saying it had gone `` far outside the bounds of literary arguments.'' `` The magazine has taken upon itself the role of a kind of judge on all questions of social life, politics, the economy, culture and morals,'' they wrote. The seven grouped <PERSON> Ogonyok </PERSON> along with Soviet publications they said are engaged in an `` unprecedented distortion of history, and that revise the social achievements of the people.'' They accused it of printing unverified hearsay and of deprecating Soviet cultural icons such as poet <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Mayakovsky </PERSON> and Nobel literature laureate <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Sholokhov </PERSON>, author of `` And Quiet Flows the Don.'' Those signing the letter, including conservative writers <PERSON> Valentin </PERSON> <PERSON> Rasputin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Vasily </PERSON> <PERSON> Belov </PERSON>, said they supported `` with all their souls'' the reform program undertaken by <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, but had become alarmed by `` scum bubbling up on the crest of the mighty stream of renovation.'' <PERSON> Ogonyok </PERSON> has drawn tough and insulting criticism from other Soviet media before, but Pravda gave great prominence to the letter, printing it above the fold on its back page. That placement in the party's top daily could indicate high-level irritation at <LOCATION> Ogonyok </LOCATION> and its view of the Soviet past and present. Since the magazine has been one of the leaders in the drive for franker discussion of social problems and a more honest coming-to-grips with the country's past, any official attack on it would be perceived by many Soviets as a signal of glasnost's limits. <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION>, the government's afternoon newspaper, ran its own correspondent's article that cast doubt on <PERSON> Ogonyok </PERSON>'s credibility and wondered aloud why <PERSON> Korotich </PERSON> was trying to run in a <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> neighborhood for a seat in a new national assembly, the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION>, to be elected in March. The Ogonyok editor was seen by millions of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> television viewers when <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> anchorman <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rather </PERSON> visited with him in a segment of the network's 1987 documentary on Soviet life, `` Seven Days in May.'' Under glasnost, the magazine has been transformed from a staid journal to a lively and popular magazine. <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> correspondent <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stepovoi </PERSON> said he attended a Jan. 9 meeting of voters from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s 21st electoral district called to nominate <PERSON> Korotich </PERSON> to the new council. <PERSON> Ogonyok </PERSON> this week ran a story on the same meeting, and said it was broken up by vocal right-wing Russian nationalists extremists before the necessary quorum of 500 voters could assemble. <PERSON> Stepovoi </PERSON>, however, said not only members of the group known as `` Pamyat,'' or `` Memory,'' had caused the disorders, implying <PERSON> Korotich </PERSON> supporters also were involved. He said the shouting march began after organizers of the meeting announced they had failed to assemble a quorum and that <PERSON> Korotich </PERSON> would hold a `` creative meeting'' instead. <PERSON> Stepovoi </PERSON> also questioned why <PERSON> Korotich </PERSON> would want to run for the new assembly from a <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> district, since some Soviet social organizations that are entitled to direct representation in the assembly have already named <PERSON> Korotich </PERSON> as a candidate. `` What's the point?'' <PERSON> Stepovoi </PERSON> asked. `` As <PERSON> Ogonyok </PERSON> has reported, <PERSON> Korotich </PERSON> was nominated as a candidate for people's deputy of the U.S.S.R.'' He added: `` I can personally note that he's been chosen by the magazine's collective.''

<HEAD>Supreme Court Hears Case that Could Affect Racial Bias Claims</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, in a case that could affect on-the-job racial bias lawsuits nationwide, was urged Wednesday to throw out discrimination charges against <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> salmon canneries. Both sides in the case acknowledged that the industry _ a seasonal business that relies on migrant workers drawn from remote areas _ is hardly typical of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> commerce. But the case could provide standards for handling job discrimination claims throughout the nation. <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fryer </PERSON>, a lawyer for two companies based in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state and <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, said employers in the case have done more than their fair share of hiring minorities at canneries they operate in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>. The companies `` should not be penalized'' under misplaced legal theories adopted by a lower court, <PERSON> Fryer </PERSON> said. But <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Arditi </PERSON>, representing Filipinos, <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> natives and Asians, said the companies relegated the minority workers to the lowest-paying jobs in a `` pervasive'' discriminatory system. He said the minority workers were capable of doing the better-paying jobs. `` There's no question about the availability of skilled personnel'' among the minority groups, <PERSON> Arditi </PERSON> said. The court's ruling, expected by July, could clear up questions left unanswered by a ruling last June that said employees can use statistical evidence to prove that some subjective decisions made by their employers violate federal law. The court reinstated a suit by a black woman who charged a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> bank with discrimination. But that ruling failed to produce a majority of five votes for any particular legal theory, and some observers believe it could prove at best a mixed blessing for minority groups. In the <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> case, non-whites charged discrimination by <ORGANIZATION> Wards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cove </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Packing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Inc. of <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Castle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Cooke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Astoria </LOCATION>, Ore The companies operate salmon canneries in remote areas of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> during the summer salmon run. Non-whites say that while they hold nearly half the jobs at the canneries, the jobs are racially stratified with whites dominating in the higher-paying positions such as machinists, carpenters and administrators. The companies said any racial divisions are for legitimate business-related reasons. For example, they said most higher-paying jobs require skill and prior experience that non-whites have difficulty acquiring because they are seasonal workers from remote regions of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Arditi </PERSON>, challenging that claim Wednesday, said nepotism is pervasive in the canneries with whites hiring inexperienced youthful relatives for higher-paying jobs. `` You have 14-year-olds, 15-year-olds, 16-year-olds who are hired for upper-level jobs,'' <PERSON> Arditi </PERSON> said. Justice <PERSON> Antonin </PERSON> <PERSON> Scalia </PERSON> questioned whether that is proof of racial bias. He offered the example of a family-owned business that hires family members. One of the key issues in the case is the use of statistics to demonstrate bias _ or the lack of it. <PERSON> Fryer </PERSON> argued that statistics showing non-whites holding most of the lower-paying seasonal cannery worker jobs and fewer better positions do not prove discrimination. The relevant figures are those showing that the companies hire for the higher-ranking positions from a <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> labor market that is only 10 percent non-white, he said. The companies say they filled those more desirable jobs with more than 20 percent non-whites. A federal judge ruled in favor of the companies in 1983, throwing out the suit. But the 9th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> reinstated the suit in 1987 and ordered a full trial. The companies appealed to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to overrule the appeals court. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration is siding with the cannery owners. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the 9th Circuit court placed too heavy a burden on the companies to disprove the bias claims. The case is Wards Cove vs. <PERSON> Atonio </PERSON>, 87-1387.

<HEAD>One Expectant Mother In Five Uses Cocaine, BCH Study Finds</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A continuing <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> study has found that 18 percent of expectant mothers, most from the inner city, use cocaine at least once during pregnancy. `` It's very alarming,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Zuckerman </PERSON> of the hospital's Division of Development Behavioral Pediatrics. `` Cocaine is not only bad during pregnancy, but being a cocaine abuser is not a great way for a child to be reared.'' The study is expected to be completed in six months and <PERSON> Zuckerman </PERSON> said Wednesday that researchers are still investigating the health consequences of the drug abuse. Dr. <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, director of neo-natalogy at <ORGANIZATION> BCH </ORGANIZATION>, said cocaine abuse is a common problem. `` This is n't just something pregnant women do. It's something people do. We're seeing an epidemic number of people using cocaine. A lot of what we're seeing in babies is related to the amount of drugs on the street,'' she said. Some babies born to cocaine abusers have small heads, indicating their brains have n't grown adequately, <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said. Other potential side effects in infants are irritability, quivering, behavioral abnormalities and poor feeding ability. The study of 1,226 pregnant women was based on urine tests and interviews conducted between July 1984 and December 1987 at <ORGANIZATION> BCH </ORGANIZATION>, which serves a large portion of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>'s inner-city population. The study was funded by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Abuse </ORGANIZATION>. Other results of the <ORGANIZATION> BCH </ORGANIZATION> study included: _ 36 percent of the admitted drug users said they used cocaine less than once a month _ 16 percent used it up to three times monthly _ 25 percent said they used it once or twice a week _ 23 percent said they used it three or more times a week Last summer, a study by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Perinatal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Addiction </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> found that at least 11 percent in 36 participating hospitals had used illegal drugs during pregnancy.

<HEAD>Gorbachev Says Soviet Forces in European Theater to Be Cut by 240,000</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said Wednesday his program to cut the armed forces by 500,000 men will bring a reduction of 240,000 Soviet soldiers in the European theater and 200,000 in <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> in the next two years. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said the number of Soviet soldiers, sailors and airmen will be cut by 12 percent, the military budget trimmed by 14.2 percent and the production of arms and military supplies slashed by 19.5 percent. He said 10,000 tanks will be eliminated in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, of which `` 5,000 will be physically liquidated, and the others transformed into towing vehicles for civilian needs or into training simulators.'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> accused some people in the West of disparaging the unilateral Soviet move by claiming that only obsolete armored vehicles would be destroyed. `` Here's the way it is: We will withdraw 5,000 of the most modern tanks from our military groups,'' the Soviet leader said. It was his most detailed explanation yet of the implications of his Dec. 7 announcement in a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> speech that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> will cut its armed forces by 500,000 men over the next two years. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> gave the details in a meeting with former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Secretary of State <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON>, former President <PERSON> Valery </PERSON> <PERSON> Giscard </PERSON> d'Estaing of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, former Japanese Prime Minister <PERSON> Yasuhiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON> and other visiting dignitaries. His remarks were distributed by the official <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency. `` Of the 500,000 men, by which the army and fleet will be reduced in two years, 240,000 will come from the European part of the country, 200,000 in the east, and 60,000 in the south,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> also said the second phase of the withdrawal of Soviet military units from <LOCATION> Mongolia </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> ally, will begin soon, and that they will be cut by 75 percent. A Soviet air force group stationed in <LOCATION> Mongolia </LOCATION> will be liquidated, he said. He also said many <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> units of an `` offensive character'' will be withdrawn from <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. By Jan. 1, 1991, all remaining Soviet units stationed on the territory of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> allies in that region will have taken on `` an exclusively defensive character,'' he said. On Monday, a Soviet general was quoted as telling Austrian television that his country's unilateral withdrawal from <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> will begin in April. Deputy Defense Minister <PERSON> Vitaly </PERSON> <PERSON> Shabanov </PERSON> was quoted as saying the partial withdrawal of 50,000 troops from <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, announced by <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> in his <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> speech, will take place in two phases. The first phase will be complete this year, and the second in 1990, Austrian television reported <PERSON> Shabonov </PERSON> as saying in an interview with its <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> correspondent.

 <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION> on Wednesday expelled exiled Ugandan dictator <PERSON> Idi </PERSON> <PERSON> Amin </PERSON> to <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, a French news agency reported. <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION> first expelled <PERSON> Amin </PERSON> last week, but he ended up back in <LOCATION> Kinshasa </LOCATION> after <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> officials reportedly refused to let him board a plane to the kingdom. Agence France-Presse quoted unidentified sources Wednesday as saying that this time a `` great friend'' of <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Mobutu </PERSON> <PERSON> Sese </PERSON> <PERSON> Seko </PERSON> persuaded <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> officials to let <PERSON> Amin </PERSON> return. The report could not immediately be confirmed. The former Ugandan leader has lived in <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> since his overthrow in 1979. <PERSON> Amin </PERSON>, 61, first arrived in <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION> Jan. 3 on a false passport. He was expelled on Thursday to <LOCATION> Dakar </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Senegal </LOCATION>. From there, he was expected to be returned to <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, but ended up on a flight back to <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION>. Arab diplomats in <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> have told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> that <PERSON> Amin </PERSON> had abused his hospitality in the kingdom and would not be allowed to return. <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> granted him political asylum in 1980. Saudi officials have not commented on <PERSON> Amin </PERSON>'s travels or whether they planned to bar him from the nation. Last week, <LOCATION> Uganda </LOCATION> asked for <PERSON> Amin </PERSON>'s extradition from <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION>, but the nations do not have an extradition treaty. <LOCATION> Uganda </LOCATION>'s state-owned newspaper, New Vision, said on Tuesday that <PERSON> Amin </PERSON> should face trial in his homeland. <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, a London-based human rights organization, estimates that between 50,000 and 300,000 Ugandans disappeared during <PERSON> Amin </PERSON>'s rule.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> has filed consumer fraud charges against a <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> physician who told patients his treatments would increase their chances of becoming pregnant, the <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday. The complaint alleges that Dr. <PERSON> Cecil </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobson </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Reproductive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Genetic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, told his patients his hormone-injection treatments had resulted in full-term, successful pregnancies for more than 80 percent of his patients. In fact, no more than 40 percent of those who received repeated injections of Human Chorionic Gonadotropin, or HCG, became pregnant, according to <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON>. While HCG slightly enhances the odds of a woman becoming pregnant, the hormone is more commonly found simply as a chemical biproduct of pregnancy, usually showing up in urine tests, according to the <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION>. In all, <PERSON> Jacobson </PERSON> treated `` several hundred women'' who lost from $ 400,000 to more than $ 2 million, <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> will be seeking a return of some or all fees collected from each patient <PERSON> Jacobson </PERSON> treated, <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> said. In addition, the <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> has also asked the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> to issue a preliminary injunction prohibiting <PERSON> Jacobson </PERSON> from making further such claims. Several of <PERSON> Jacobson </PERSON>'s patients have also filed civil suits against him. They are seeking recovery of fees; some also want unspecified damages. While the treatments caused no physical harm, a 38-year-old patient of <PERSON> Jacobson </PERSON>'s was told by another physician that she had greatly diminished her chances of becoming pregnant because the several years she spent using <PERSON> Jacobson </PERSON>'s program had taken her closer to the end of her fertility cycle, an <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> official said. <PERSON> Jacobson </PERSON> was not immediately available to comment. His license to practice medicine has not been suspended, <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> walked out of a stormy parliament debate Wednesday after opposition members heckled him about increased bloodshed in the occupied territories and demanded he resign. Eight small parties tried to bring down the government with a series of no-confidence motions, but legislators of the broad national unity government voted them down. The opposition reflected growing unease many Israelis feel about the army's handling of the Palestinian uprising in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. There also is frustration because the army has not been able to squelch the 13-month revolt, which does not appear to be flagging. The Cabinet met privately for a briefing on tougher army policies that include destroying the houses of suspected stone-throwers and liberalizing shooting regulations. At the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, deputy <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> observer <PERSON> Riyad </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mansour </PERSON> said the Israelis were committing `` a small massacre'' in an attempt to crush the uprising during the transition between <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> administrations. <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON>, who stopped his speech at least a dozen times because of raucous shouting, left the podium after about half an hour and refused to complete his statement. `` I propose the government reject these no-confidence motions,'' he said quietly before leaving the hall. The debate was over the high number of Palestinian deaths in recent weeks. Thirteen Palestinians have been killed in the past week, and critics have blamed many of the casualties on the army's increasing use of plastic bullets and newly introduced rubber-coated metal pellets. Four Palestinians were reported wounded in stone-throwing clashes with <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> on Wednesday. The army confirmed the injures, two in <LOCATION> Hebron </LOCATION> and two near <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>. The army spokesman's office said it was checking reports that on Tuesday and Wednesday an army lieutenant fired at rooftop water tanks in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Tulkarem </LOCATION>. Arab reporters said five tanks were punctured. <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> said that as long as Palestinians stage violent protests, the tougher army policies will stand. `` As long as they say, ` We will continue with violence,' their violence will be met with force,'' he said. `` What is <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to do?'' `` Talk peace!'' shouted one Arab member of parliament. `` Get out of the territories!'' shouted another. `` This is a government with a plastic heart, a brain of lead and a conscience of rubber,'' said <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Miari </PERSON> of the Progressive List for Peace. <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> said residents of the occupied territories refused to abandon support for the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> and instead talk peace directly with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> refuses to talk with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, which it considers a terrorist organization. `` What does all that have to do with killing children, with the daily slaughter in the territories?'' shouted <PERSON> Tewfik </PERSON> <PERSON> Toubi </PERSON>, an Arab member of the <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. Since the uprising began in December 1987, 362 Palestinians have been killed and 15 Jews have died. Two right-wing parties filed no-confidence motions, but they charged that <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> was too soft on Palestinians during the intefadeh, which is Arabic for uprising. `` We have failed to deal with the intefadeh,'' said <PERSON> Rehavam </PERSON> <PERSON> Zee </PERSON> ` vi of the right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Homeland </ORGANIZATION> `` Youths and children are going wild in the streets and villages while we sit embarrassed and confused.'' His party advocates mass deportations of Arabs. <PERSON> Yossi </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarid </PERSON> of the liberal <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> charged that the government's policy `` is not just killing Palestinians, it is killing the souls of <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers.'' He was referring to complaints that angry soldiers lodged Tuesday with Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> when he visited a tent camp in <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>. They said they were foced to beat innocent people and felt they were betraying their values.

 Two people injured in a weekend train collision died in a hospital Wednesday, bringing the death toll in <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>'s worst railway accident to 119, hospital officials said. Doctors said 116 people were still hospitalized for treatment of injuries suffered in the accident in central <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> on Sunday. Forty-seven of them suffered arm and leg fractures and may be crippled, doctors said. The doctors, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said several will require limb amputations. The crash occurred when a passenger train traveling about 50 mph rammed head-on into a mail train outside the village of <LOCATION> Maizdi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Khan </LOCATION>, 16 miles north of <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION>. At least 100 people died at the scene and 19 others have died in hospitals. Officials said at least 1,000 people were injured in the collision. The government has put the death toll at 82, but its count is generally considered too low due to bureacratic delays in counting the dead. <LOCATION> Dhaka </LOCATION> newspapers placed the toll at more than 200.

 The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday it has obtained a tape recording of <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> chairman, threatening to pump `` 10 bullets in the chest'' of anyone trying to stifle the Palestinian uprising on the Israeli-held <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>. The department noted that <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> has since denied the threat, and there was no indication the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was reconsidering its decision to talk with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. But officials said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has made clear to <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> that it considers the comment inconsistent with his commitment to renounce terrorism. And <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sources speaking on condition of anonymity said that President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told Egyptian President <PERSON> Hosni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> in a letter of his concern over the remarks. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> must make sure <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> does not deviate from his pledge to refrain from terrorism and to recognize <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right to exist, said the sources. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said the department had received a tape recording of comments <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> made last week in which he said, `` Whoever thinks of stopping the Intifada before it achieves its goals, I will give him 10 bullets in the chest.'' Intifada is the Arabic word for the 13-month uprising by Palestinians against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s occupation of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. The reported threat was believed to be directed at <PERSON> Elias </PERSON> <PERSON> Freij </PERSON>, the mayor of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION> who is considered a moderate <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> and who called for a truce in the uprising. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> has denied threatening him, but <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said, `` That is clearly a threat. We've made it clear that this threat is inconsistent with <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s December 14 renunciation of terrorism and with the U.S.-PLO dialogue.'' That dialogue began last December, after the organization accepted <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> conditions that it recognization of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right to exist and renounce use of terrorism. Since then, <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Pelletreau </PERSON> has met in <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION> with several <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> officials. Last year, Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, accusing the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> of terrorism and <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> of being an accessory, barred the issuance of a visa to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chief to address the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> subsequently recommended the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dialogue with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, while maintaining a public campaign against terrorism. The renewed possibility of an <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> visit to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> arose after the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chief said he would be willing to address the annual convention of the <ORGANIZATION> American-Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Anti-Discrimination </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> in April. But <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> told a group of Arab Americans who met with him in <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION> last week that he could only come to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> if they could arrange a visa for him, said one participant, <PERSON> Khalil </PERSON> <PERSON> Jahshan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said if <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> applied for a visa to address a group in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> `` we would look at it very carefully.'' He said such an application at the moment was `` hypothetical.'' Secretary of State-designate <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> was noncommittal on the visa question Wednesday at his <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> confirmation hearing. He said he was `` not in a position to prejudge what we would do'' if <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> applies for a visa. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> also said there is a difference between asking for a visa to address the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> and asking for a visa `` in conjunction'' with a speaking engagement in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. He did not elaborate, saying he did not want to be seen as `` tilting'' the issue one way or another.

 In one of the last public events of his eight years in the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on Wednesday paid a sentimental tribute to the championship Notre Dame football team and received in return a sweater once presented to _ who else? _ <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Gipp </PERSON>. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, whose role as <PERSON> Gipp </PERSON>, the Notre Dame star, in `` <ORGANIZATION> Knute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rockne </ORGANIZATION>, All-American'' gave him his first big break in the movie career that helped propel him to the presidency, told the players: `` I ca n't help thinking that somewhere a long way off there's a fellow with a big grin and a lot of pride in his school and he might be thinking to himself that maybe you won another one for the Gipper.'' The line was a paraphrase of one spoken by <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> O </PERSON> <PERSON> ` </PERSON> <PERSON> Brien </PERSON> as Rockne in the movie, invoking the memory of <PERSON> Gipp </PERSON> after his death to inspire the team to victory. It has become a political slogan <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has repeated many times. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told the players how much he values his association with Notre Dame, which he has twice visited during his presidency. `` The INF Treaty and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s election were important, but having the Fighting Irish win the national championship is in a class by itself,'' he said. The president of Notre Dame, the Rev. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Malloy </PERSON>, presented <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> with the sweater, in a glass-lidded presentation box. The sweater had been awarded to <PERSON> Gipp </PERSON> for his performance as a halfback on the Notre Dame team in 1917 and 1918. `` I think that's a great sacrifice by the university, but, believe me, no one could treasure it more than I will,'' the president said. <PERSON> Lou </PERSON> <PERSON> Holtz </PERSON>, the coach of the Fighting Irish, gave <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> a football from the team's 34-21 Fiesta Bowl victory over the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> tossed the ball to a member of the Notre Dame team. The Fiesta Bowl victory Jan. 2 gave the university its eighth national championship _ the most in the 53-year history of the <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> poll.

<DATELINE>FRANKFURT, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Prosecutors on Wednesday announced criminal probes of a key company in the Libyan chemical weapons plant dispute and a <LOCATION> Bavarian </LOCATION> company that reportedly delivered sophisticated equipment to <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>'s air force. The new probes bring to three the number of criminal investigations in the widening scandal, and in each case authorities acknowledged they were checking allegations made by West German news reports. Since the first allegations of West German involvement were published early this month, the nation's news media have been particularly aggressive about pursuing the story. Politicians, meanwhile, have had to retract their earlier denials of West German involvement with the plant in <LOCATION> Rabta </LOCATION>, 60 miles south of the Libyan capital of <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> says it was built to make chemical arms, while the Libyan government of Col. <PERSON> Moammar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> says it will make pharmaceuticals. In <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> on Wednesday, Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> sat with other lawmakers as his chief aide, <PERSON> Wolfgang </PERSON> <PERSON> Schaeuble </PERSON>, addressed an acrimonious session of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> about when the government in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> first learned of the charges. <PERSON> Schaeuble </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government in May passed on tips about West German involvement in the suspected Libyan chemical weapons plant. He said the tips also involved the alleged German help in providing <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON>'s air force with midair refueling capability. The <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> prosecutor's office said Wednesday it has opened a criminal investigation of the now-defunct I.B.I. Engineering company, which <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have accused of providing equipment for the plant. `` Our authorities opened the probe against I.B.I. on Friday because of suspicion of reported violations of export laws,'' <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> prosecutor <PERSON> Jochen </PERSON> <PERSON> Schroers </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in a telephone interview. He declined to provide further information about <ORGANIZATION> I.B.I. </ORGANIZATION>, which allegedly provided the contracts to the West German companies to build the plant. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> ARD </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> network </ORGANIZATION> reported that about 50 companies just in the greater <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> area are suspected of having taken part. Federal customs officials are also investigating. In <LOCATION> Munich </LOCATION>, chief prosecutor <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON> <PERSON> Stocker </PERSON> said he was looking into a report in this week's <ORGANIZATION> Der </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Spiegel </ORGANIZATION> magazine that says the <ORGANIZATION> Intec </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Logistik </ORGANIZATION> company has been helping <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> develop the ability to refuel its warplanes while in flight. The prosecutor said he had already planned to investigate <ORGANIZATION> Intec </ORGANIZATION>, but added authorities want to know whether the report in <LOCATION> Spiegel </LOCATION> is correct. `` That is a point of the investigation,'' <PERSON> Stocker </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> in a telephone interview late Wednesday afternoon. `` We will have to see what comes out.'' The probe against <ORGANIZATION> Intec </ORGANIZATION> `` concerns fuel tank equipment sent to <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>'' and may also involve violations of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s export laws, he said. `` We do n't know what was done with this equipment in <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>.'' <ORGANIZATION> Der </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Spiegel </ORGANIZATION> reported 10 Intec-hired engineers are playing a key role in helping <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> fit warplanes and transport planes with equipment necessary for mid-air refueling to extend the warplanes' range <ORGANIZATION> Intec </ORGANIZATION> is in the town of <LOCATION> Vaterstetten </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Munich </LOCATION>. Last week, <LOCATION> Offenburg </LOCATION> prosecutor <PERSON> Werner </PERSON> <PERSON> Botz </PERSON> announced he was investigating the Imhausen-Chemie company, which reportedly also had a major role in the construction of the suspected chemical weapons plant. <LOCATION> Offenburg </LOCATION> is near the Black Forest town of <LOCATION> Lahr </LOCATION>, where <ORGANIZATION> Imhausen </ORGANIZATION> has its headquarters.

<HEAD>19th-Century Woman's Story Is Talk of Town</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY HARKAVY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>FAYETTE, Maine (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The long-whispered dark secret of a 19th-century woman who was ostracized by this small town after she reputedly violated one of society's strictest sexual taboos was openly the talk of the town Wednesday. `` Everybody's been buzzing about this,'' librarian <PERSON> Suzanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> said the day after an documentary about the woman who unknowingly married her own son was broadcast nationally on public television. At the town office, deputy clerk <PERSON> Audrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Bamford </PERSON> said most everyone she spoke to had taped the show on their videocassette recorder. `` I guess it's the most taped show in the town of <LOCATION> Fayette </LOCATION>,'' she said. The story of <PERSON> Emeline </PERSON> <PERSON> Bacheldor </PERSON>, born in 1816, has surfaced twice in the past decade. The first was `` Emmeline,'' a fictionalized account with an altered spelling by best-selling author <PERSON> Judith </PERSON> <PERSON> Rossner </PERSON>. Then on Tuesday, the facts came fully out in the open when a nonfiction account, `` Sins of Our Mothers,'' was shown as the final installment of <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>'s `` The American Experience'' series. Most residents of t6his western <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> town reacted favorably to the documentary, expressing shock and sadness at the way <PERSON> Emeline </PERSON> was shunned by the town and forced to live out her final years in isolation and poverty in a tiny shack. They also noted how dramatically society's attitudes have changed. `` Back then everybody was very puritanical, and if anyone did anything that was against the rules of the church, they avoided them like the plague. But people today are a lot more forgiving,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Bamford </PERSON>, who helped research the program. The program, based on interviews and town records, told how <PERSON> Emeline </PERSON> was sent to work in a <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> cotton mill and became pregnant at the age of 14. The baby was given up for adoption, and <PERSON> Emeline </PERSON> returned to <LOCATION> Fayette </LOCATION> where she married. Her husband later ran away, and she fell in love with a much younger man, <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gurney </PERSON>, whom she married when she was 62. But when <PERSON> Gurney </PERSON>'s relatives came to meet his bride, they realized he was the son she had given up. The marriage was annulled, <PERSON> Gurney </PERSON> left town and <PERSON> Emeline </PERSON> was treated as an outcast. Criticism of the film focused on its accuracy and the motivation of those behind the project. <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Sturtevant </PERSON>, a banker and deacon of the <ORGANIZATION> Fayette </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, called the documentary `` a valuable and sensitive portrayal of the human condition, a true tragedy.'' But he added: `` How much can be a true, loving concern for the poverty-stricken and socially oppressed, such as <PERSON> Emeline </PERSON>, and how much of it might be more properly characterized as selfish catering to man's taste for prurient sensationalism?'' Library volunteer <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> <PERSON> Merrill </PERSON> complained that the film portrayed the town in a negative light. Producer <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON> first learned of <PERSON> Emeline </PERSON> while interviewing <PERSON> Nettie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, an elderly woman known as a storyteller, in 1974 for an unrelated Bicenntennial project. Mrs. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, who died in 1981 two days before her 95th birthday, was believed to have been the last person to set eyes upon <PERSON> Emeline </PERSON>, who died in 1898. She recalled being sent by her father to take food to the outcast woman who otherwise would have starved to death. `` I was absolutely flabbergasted,'' recalled <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON>. He took the story to <PERSON> Rossner </PERSON>, the novelist best-known for `` Looking for Mr. <PERSON> Goodbar </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Rossner </PERSON>'s 1980 book, `` Emmeline,'' was based on what she heard from Mrs. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, but made little claim to historic accuracy. Before <PERSON> Rossner </PERSON>'s book, according to most accounts, <PERSON> Emeline </PERSON>'s story was a town secret, known by longtime residents `` It was talked about, but always whispered _ dirty rumors and that sort of thing,'' said <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>, director of the documentary. Town Manager <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> DeArmott </PERSON>, a longtime resident, said <PERSON> Emeline </PERSON>'s story was `` one of those things that was kind of hidden away back in the corner. `` Everyone embellished it a little bit,'' he said, and they would `` luxuriate in our little secret.''

 Newly arrived Nicaraguans expressed gratitude Wednesday at the warm reception they've received and puzzlement at black resentment that some say has fueled rioting. `` The support of our <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> brothers has been very generous, the solidarity with them has been great,'' said <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Quintero </PERSON>, 43, one of about 2,000 Central Americans who have immigrated to the <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> area the past two months. The influx swelled to about 100,000 people the Nicaraguan exile community centered in a county that already was one-third Cuban. Some black community leaders have cited resentment over the welcome given the Nicaraguans and fears the new immigrants will crowd blacks out of jobs as fueling ethnic tensions in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. The rioting that broke out this week began after the fatal shooting of a young black man by a Hispanic police officer. `` The riots are terrible, a disaster,'' said <PERSON> Quintero </PERSON>, who with his wife and three children have been taken in by Nicaraguan friends in <LOCATION> Sweetwater </LOCATION>, the nearby city dubbed <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>. `` I do n't understand it I heard it might have something to do with us. I heard the blacks do n't like us too much.'' `` This does n't have anything to do with us. We did n't come here to cause problems. We came here to work and to live in freedom,'' said <PERSON> Julio </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquilar </PERSON>, a youth looking over a Spanish-language newspaper report on the rioting. He was outside <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Maduro </PERSON> <PERSON> Stadium </PERSON>, a makeshift city shelter for about 200 Nicaraguans and about 180 other <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> homeless people. The city is renovating a replacement shelter so the stadium can be vacated by next week and readied for its spring tenants, the <ORGANIZATION> Baltimore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orioles </ORGANIZATION> baseball team. Meanwhile, the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Archdiocese </ORGANIZATION> put up 150 immigrants at its Family Activities Center on Sunday. <PERSON> Gerard </PERSON> <PERSON> Jean-Juste </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> priest, and other Haitian community leaders and some American black leaders said Haitians, who are black, do n't receive such help. They said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has a racist immigration policy of intercepting Haitians at sea and sending them back home while allowing white Hispanics to enter from <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and apply for political asylum. Cuban-born Mayor <PERSON> Xavier </PERSON> <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON> has blamed the rioting on bad police relations with the black community and other long-term problems. But he also said Wednesday it was time for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> immigration policy to remove distinctions that give the appearance of discrimination. The Nicaraguan arrivals hit a peak of 200 a day after a federal judge in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> ruled two weeks ago that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> immigration authorities could n't force them to stay near the border while their political asylum requests were being considered. <PERSON> Virginia </PERSON> <PERSON> Kice </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman in <LOCATION> Harlingen </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, said that since Jan. 9, authorities had received 2,733 political asylum applications from Central Americans. Of those, 44 percent were Nicaraguans, she said. `` Thirty-four percent -LRB- of the Central Americans -RRB- indicated they were traveling on to <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, which is fewer than we expected from our previous experience,'' Ms. <PERSON> Kice </PERSON> said. She said it was too early to speculate on why the numbers were lower than the 50 percent predicted. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, at 13 percent each, were the next-favorite destinations, she said. Many of the Nicaraguans are without work permits, which are handed out slowly by <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> after case-by-case review. But in addition to city aid, Spanish-language radio and television drives have raised about $ 70,000, and private donors have kept them supplied with clothing and food. `` A lot of them have gained weight here. Some of them got sick because they ate too much,'' said <PERSON> Pablo </PERSON> <PERSON> Canton </PERSON>, assistant city director of community development. `` Most of the Cubans can identify with this group; that's why they've been so generous,'' said <LOCATION> Canton </LOCATION>, who came with his family from <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> 27 years ago at age 16. `` They're going through the same thing we went through, leaving their homeland because of communists.'' He rejected criticisms from some black leaders that the city has gone out of its way to accommodate Nicaraguans while doing little for its other poor and homeless. `` We have a big heart for everybody,'' <LOCATION> Canton </LOCATION> said. `` These people need help, and the federal government is n't doing anything. We're just trying to help them get started; to give them a positive attitude that this is the land of dreams if you work for it.''

<TEXT>
 The Energy Department on Wednesday officially crowned <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> the winner of a seven-state battle to host a proposed $ 5.9 billion superconducting super collider. At a formal ceremony attended by <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Clements </PERSON>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Herrington </PERSON>, the energy secretary, signed an official `` record of decision'' to build the massive physics installation around the city of <LOCATION> Waxahachie </LOCATION>, about 25 miles south of <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>. The collider is envisioned as a 53-mile underground ring that would use 10,000 magnets to whirl beams of protons into each other at energy levels 20 times what is possible in today's most powerful machines. Scientists will use the facility to explore the nature of matter and energy. It is to be called the <ORGANIZATION> Ronald </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reagan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High-Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Physics </ORGANIZATION>, although it remains uncertain whether <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will give the go-ahead to begin construction. Last year, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> agreed to spend $ 100 million on the collider, but it decreed that none of the money be spent on construction. In his budget proposal for the coming fiscal year, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> requested $ 250 million for the collider, including $ 90 million for research and development and $ 160 million for construction. <PERSON> Herrington </PERSON> had declared last Nov. 10 that <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> was the `` preferred site'' for the project, but a waiting period was required before the choice was made official. `` <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> has been chosen as the super collider site because it is the superior site from an overall standpoint,'' <PERSON> Herrington </PERSON> said at the signing ceremony. Some of the states that lost in the bidding have questioned the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s selection process. Democratic Sens. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> are among those who have asked <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>'s investigative arm, the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, to review the department's site selection process and to determine whether the choice was influenced more by politics than by merit. <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Weisskopf </PERSON>, a physicist who attended the signing ceremony as part of a separate award presentation, said the super collider would allow scientists to explore `` how this great universe was started and how it has developed.'' `` We need the superconducting super collider ... to help all the scientists of the planet to penetrate deeper into the mysteries of matter,'' he said. Besides <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, the states which lost the bidding race were <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Prosecutor: Convictions Needed In '85 Soccer Deaths</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BRUSSELS, Belgium (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A prosecutor on Wednesday urged a judge to convict 15 Britons, two Belgian police officers and a former soccer official on charges stemming from a 1985 stadium riot that killed 39 soccer fans. `` The sentence should be an example,'' Prosecutor <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Erauw </PERSON> said during the third and final day of his closing argument. On trial are 26 Britons, two Belgian state police officers, the <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> mayor and deputy mayor, two <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> soccer officials and <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosens </PERSON>, former secretary-general of the Belgian soccer federation. <PERSON> Erauw </PERSON> said two of the 26 British suspects should be acquitted for lack of proof and that he had `` reservations'' about eight other British cases. He also asked that one case be severed from the other British cases because the suspect is jailed in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> on an unrelated matter. The judge's decision is expected in March. If convicted of involuntary manslaughter, the British suspects face up to 10 years in jail, although <PERSON> Erauw </PERSON> has called for terms of only up to four years. President Judge <PERSON> Peirre </PERSON> <PERSON> Verlynde </PERSON> still can override <PERSON> Erauw </PERSON>'s recommendations However, a defense lawyer said convictions are unlikely against the 10 suspects against whom the evidence was questioned by <PERSON> Erauw </PERSON>. `` He is effectively recommending the -LRB- complete acquittal -RRB- for those defendants against whom he says guilt has not been established to his satisfaction,'' said Sir <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Livermore </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Liverpool </LOCATION>. But <PERSON> Erauw </PERSON> said two Belgian state police officials and <PERSON> Roosens </PERSON> should be convicted. They face up to two years in jail. On Monday, he cited inadequate organization of the match by <PERSON> Roosens </PERSON>, who was secretary-general of the Belgian soccer federation at the time of the tragedy. He also blamed state police officers <PERSON> Johan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahieu </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Kensier </PERSON> for inadequate security measures and failing to act to stem the rioting. On Tuesday, he said the <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> mayor, his alderman for sports matters and two officials of the Union of European Football Associations should not be sentenced. The 26 Britons are accused of instigating <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s worst-ever soccer riot. The violence broke out on May 29, 1985, before a game between <ORGANIZATION> Juventus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Turin </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> FC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liverpool </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION>, the final match of the European Champions' Cup at <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION>' Heysel Stadium. The Britons were charged based on videotapes and photographs taken of the rioting, which began when British soccer fans charged into a neighboring section of the stands filled mostly with <LOCATION> Italian </LOCATION> fans. About 500 people were hurt and 39, including 34 Italians, were killed during the ensuing stampede. The British defendants are on trial after their government, seeking to come to grips with soccer hooliganism, agreed to extradite them. They are expected to be allowed to return home to await the end of the trial that began Oct. 15.

 Children returned to class to confront their fears with help from psychologists Wednesday, just one day after a gunman fascinated by toy soldiers killed five youngsters at the school he attended as a boy. Blood was washed from the pavement overnight and bullet holes were patched at <ORGANIZATION> Cleveland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, where experts said it was important that pupils, mostly children of Southeast Asian refugees, deal with the trauma immediately. `` I still feel upset, but I have to bring my kid to see the teacher to let the teacher know my kid's all right,'' <PERSON> Brom </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> said in broken English. `` Everybody's angry. Your kid there, you get angry too.'' His daughter, 7-year-old Nary, said she was scared to return because `` I saw blood.'' Holding tightly to her father's hand, she pointed to her leg and said, `` I saw somebody get shot right here.'' Police said <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Purdy </PERSON>, wearing an olive-drab shirt bearing the Iranian battle cry `` Death to the Great Satin -LRB- sic -RRB-,'' on Tuesday sprayed more than 100 shots from an assault rifle, killing five youngsters ages 6 to 9 and wounding 30 other people. A drifter who police said was either 24 or 26, <PERSON> Purdy </PERSON> killed himself with a pistol shot to the head after the mute, methodical attack during recess. `` Why he did this we may never know,'' said Capt. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Perry </PERSON>. `` We can only assume that some problem came up in this guy that made him do it. Obviously, he had a military hangup.'' Carved into the stock of <PERSON> Purdy </PERSON>'s rifle was the word <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, Iranian for Party of God. <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> is the name of a Shiite Moslem faction in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Also carved into the rifle were the words `` freedom'' and `` victory.'' <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> said the man, in the days leading up to the bloodbath, lived in a motel room where officers found a broken rifle, about 100 toy soldiers scattered about and an olive drab cloth on which were drawn `` three snarling-type faces.'' Records indicate that a <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Purdy </PERSON> attended <ORGANIZATION> Cleveland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> through third grade, from 1969 to 1973, said district spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Klose </PERSON>. As police pieced together his past, psychologists met with the children as they returned to class today. Volunteers, some speaking Cambodian or Laotian, were expected to act as translators. Bouquets were placed atop the school sign on the lawn, and five red roses were laid at its base. Across the street, a 9-foot paper sign read, `` Racists Are Ugly _ Let's Stop Them.'' <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> said the only contact his department had with <PERSON> Purdy </PERSON> before Tuesday was in 1986, when his mother called to complain that he and his half brother had vandalized her car after she refused demands for drug money. <PERSON> Purdy </PERSON> had a long police record, most of it in the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> area, <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> said. Charges involved prostitution, marijuana, manufacture or sale of an illegal weapon, receiving stolen property and robbery, authorities said. <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> said he served jail time in at least the last two cases. <PERSON> Purdy </PERSON> had parked his station wagon behind the school and set it ablaze with a Molotov cocktail Tuesday morning. He fired 106-110 shots from a bayonet-equipped, Chinese-made AK-47 assault rifle at hundreds of youngsters enjoying a sunny recess, reloading at least once. The semiautomatic rifle, purchased in August in <LOCATION> Sandy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, for $ 147 was capable of firing as quickly as <PERSON> Purdy </PERSON> could pull the trigger, police said. `` I do n't understand why and I probably wo n't ever know why,'' said <PERSON> Purdy </PERSON>'s grandmother, 63-year-old <PERSON> Julia </PERSON> <PERSON> Chumbley </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Lodi </LOCATION>. `` It's like a nightmare This sort of thing happens to others, not you. Your own grandson.'' <PERSON> Purdy </PERSON>, who often worked as a welder and used the alias <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Purdy </PERSON> <PERSON> West </PERSON>, had apparently worked at a Stockton machine shop. <ORGANIZATION> Numeri </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tech </ORGANIZATION> president <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Tankersley </PERSON> said he hired a man he knew as <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> West </PERSON> last January to `` sit there and drill holes.'' He worked there for about a month. `` He was quiet. He always acted like he was sort of mad. You tell him what to do _ give him a job _ he never smiled,'' <PERSON> Tankersley </PERSON> said. `` In fact, I thought he was mad half the time.'' A 6-year-old boy was in serious condition and 17 pupils and a teacher were in stable condition. The others were treated at hospitals or at the scene and were released. The 40-year-old neighborhood, near the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>, is home to many retired couples who raised their familes there, But the culture has been changing with the influx of Southeast Asian refugees. Southeast Asian pupils make up about 71 percent of the school's enrollment of 986 About 100,000 Southeast Asians have immigrated to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s 300-mile long Central Valley because of its farming and fishing industries and because of a climate similar to that of their native countries

<HEAD>Lebanon's Two Governments Try To Avoid Permanent Division of Nation</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BEIRUT, Lebanon (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The heads of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s two rival governments _ one Moslem, one <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> _ agreed to work with the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> to try to prevent the split in the country from becoming permanent, officials said Wednesday. Newspapers meanwhile said Wednesday that a commander from the mainstream Shiite Moslem Amal militia was killed by Israeli tank fire in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and that a <LOCATION> Syrian </LOCATION> peacekeeping soldier was killed in cross fire from an inter-Shiite clash in south <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> has been torn by civil war for nearly 13 years. A 4-month-old political crisis threatens to solidify <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s partition into sectarian cantons <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON>, the acting prime Minister and head of the <ORGANIZATION> Moslem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION>, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> he will go to <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION> to confer with a special committee of the league on Jan. 28 on how to settle the political crisis here. Army commander Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, who heads the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION>, `` welcomed the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>'s interest in the Lebanese situation and expressed readiness to cooperate with the committee,'' a political source in <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> said on condition of anonymity. The office of Parliament Speaker <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Husseini </PERSON> announced that <PERSON> Husseini </PERSON> will also meet the committee in the Tunisian capital this month. <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON>, a Sunni Moslem, and <PERSON> Husseini </PERSON>, a Shiite, were invited by Kuwaiti envoys to meet the committee when they visited <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, on Tuesday. The Christian source said <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> `` would decide on the level of his representation at a meeting with the committee after he formally receives an invitation, which is expected later this week.'' The league committee, created last Thursday in <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION> at a meeting of <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> foreign ministers, is headed by <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>'s foreign minister, <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Sabah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Sabah </PERSON>. The committee of the 22-nation league will try to resolve the <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> crisis and facilitate the election of a new president to succeed <PERSON> Amin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON>, whose term expired Sept. 22. A squabbling <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> failed to elect a successor to <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON>, and he chose <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> to head an interim military Cabinet. Moslem leaders backed by <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, the main power broker in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, refused to recognize <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s new authority and backed a Cabinet under <PERSON> Hoss </PERSON>, a leftover of <PERSON> Gemayel </PERSON>'s splintered government. A communique from <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Nabih </PERSON> <PERSON> Berri </PERSON> said that <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION>'s head of operations in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Nabil </PERSON> <PERSON> Hijazi </PERSON>, was killed by a shell from an Israeli tank Tuesday as he was leading a reconnaissance mission near <LOCATION> Sojod </LOCATION>, north of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s self-proclaimed security zone. <PERSON> Berri </PERSON>'s communique, published by all <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> newspapers, said <PERSON> Hijazi </PERSON> died while `` gathering intelligence information on the security zone'' and proclaimed him a `` martyr.'' The pro-Syrian <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> advocates guerrilla warfare to dislodge <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> from the border enclave it carved out in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in 1985. The leftist <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> newspaper As-Safir and the independent An-Nahar said a Syrian soldier was killed Tuesday in cross fire between Amal and the Iranian-backed <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> organization in the <LOCATION> Bir </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hasan </LOCATION> residential district on <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s southern limits. The Syrian military refused to comment on the report. Amal and <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> are struggling for control of the 1 million Shiites who make up the largest sect among <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s 4 million inhabitants.

 Add one more to the list of things that ca n't be kept secret in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> When a float that looks like a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> boat rounds the corner of 15th Street and <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Avenue </LOCATION> in Friday's inaugural parade, newly sworn-in President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is supposed to get one of the surprises of his life. <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> men Wednesday draped black plastic over the float which is topped with a newly painted <ORGANIZATION> Grumman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Avenger </ORGANIZATION> aircraft like the one that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was shot down in during World War II. But the men acknowledged the plane was no longer much of a secret. There was at least one news story published about it, and photographers were attracted to the shrouded object outside the <ORGANIZATION> Smithsonian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Space Museum. The idea, according to parade organizers, was to surprise <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> with the aircraft and a dozen men from his old <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> torpedo squadron. The wingspan is so wide, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> could almost reach out and touch it from his reviewing stand, said a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officer watching over the plane. He said trees along the parade route had to be trimmed to get the plane through, and a couple of reviewing stands had to be moved back to accommodate its 54-foot wingspan. The wings could be folded back, birdlike, but the officer said parade officials wanted to be sure it could make it along the route in full flying position. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was rescued from the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> on Sept. 2, 1944, after he bailed out of his flaming Grumman Avenger torpedo bomber over the <LOCATION> Bonin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>, 600 miles south of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. He won the Distinguished Flying Cross for heroism during the bombing raid. His two crew members were killed. The plane in the parade, built in the 1940s by <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> on a Grumman design, was flown to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> after it was spotted in a field by a World War II veteran working with the <ORGANIZATION> USS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yorktown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> in Mt. Pleasant, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION> Veterans from the Yorktown arranged for the plane to be in the parade and also tracked down members of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s old torpedo squadron, <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> VT </ORGANIZATION> 51, to ride along with it, said <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharkey </PERSON>, assistant director of the veterans group. About 10,000 Avengers were built, according to <ORGANIZATION> Grumman </ORGANIZATION> historian <PERSON> Lois </PERSON> <PERSON> Louisolo </PERSON>, with 45 of the antique aircraft still registered to fly.

 The governments of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> both denied reports on Wednesday that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> threatened to bomb an Iraqi factory outside <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> if it manufactured biological weapons.

<TEXT>
 A <ORGANIZATION> Roosevelt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> graduate just wanted students to have fun. And he left $ 2.75 million to make sure. `` What a guy,'' said <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenberg </PERSON>, 24, a senior majoring in sociology. `` They should use it to hold cheap concerts with good groups. Nothing big _ a reunion of -LRB- rock group -RRB- Led Zeppelin or something like that.'' Hollywood agent <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Moss </PERSON>, 59, died of cancer in 1986 in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. He left the bulk of his estate to <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON>, saying the money should be spent only on social and recreational amenities because `` as a city-type school, I never felt students socialized as much as they might have.'' On Wednesday, some of the 6,000 students at the private, liberal arts school offered some ideas for spending the gift, which officials said was the largest in the school's 43-year history. <PERSON> Moss </PERSON>' gift will pay for a gymnasium and fitness center and renovatations to student lounges, said Roosevelt President <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> Gross </PERSON>. About $ 400,000 will be set aside to create a student activities fund, <PERSON> Gross </PERSON> said. Some students said the funds were needed to add enthusiasm to student gatherings. `` They should have parties at nice hotels and get a DJ who knows how to play really good music,'' said <PERSON> Beatrice </PERSON> <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON>, a junior studying biology. `` We need better food,'' <PERSON> Daryl </PERSON> <PERSON> McLaurine </PERSON>, 21, said, patting his stomach. `` I like food.'' <PERSON> Moss </PERSON> represented actress <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON> <PERSON> MacLaine </PERSON>, the late actor <PERSON> Desi </PERSON> <PERSON> Arnaz </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Avildsen </PERSON>, who directed the movie `` Rocky.'' He graduated in 1948 from <LOCATION> Roosevelt </LOCATION> with a degree in commerce. Roosevelt has received $ 2.25 million and expects to get the remaining $ 500,000 in about a year, said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Shepard </PERSON>, vice president for development. `` Mr. <PERSON> Moss </PERSON> was a modest donor every year and we tried to convince him to contribute more,'' <PERSON> Shepard </PERSON> said. `` He told us, ` Do n't worry, you're in my will and someday you'll be rich.''' The gift to <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON> was not the only bequest <PERSON> Moss </PERSON> made to give people a good time. He was a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> and had an outstanding wine cellar, which he left to the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>, said his lawyer, <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Sklar </PERSON>. He also left $ 20,000 for a black-tie party for his friends and business associates in <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Whyberd </PERSON>, a friend.

<HEAD>MIT Study: Nuclear Plants Work Better Overseas Because Of Amity</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ARLENE LEVINSON</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 American nuclear plants perform worse than foreign ones because of a lack of cooperation among <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> utilities and hostility between them and regulators, says a <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> study. `` What the -LRB- <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> -RRB- utilities do n't seem to have, typically, is a culture of reaching out to one another on a company-by-company basis,'' said professor <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Golay </PERSON>, a nuclear engineer and one of the report's authors. The report, financed by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> MIT </ORGANIZATION> and two electric companies, was to be released Thursday in the latest issue of the school magazine <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Review </ORGANIZATION>. The study looked at plants in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> from 1975 to 1984. In the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> it examined the nearly 200 light water reactors producing more than 300 megawatts. The average plant in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> produced energy less than 60 percent of the time, while most of the other countries at the end of the period were at 75 percent, said <ORGANIZATION> MIT </ORGANIZATION> professor <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON>, the project's chief author. `` One of our conjectures is that all elements concerned with nuclear power have not been able to work together to solve nuclear problems,'' <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Golay </PERSON> said that when <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> decided to improve the available of nuclear-generated power, `` they did it by making it a national goal. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> has tried to do some of that, but so far, in terms of availability, it has failed.'' `` What is unique to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is a highly antagonistic relationship between regulators and utilities,'' the report said. `` In other countries, relationships between regulators and utilities become strained at times, but all parties report that communication is open and forthright, with no group withholding information or acting secretly or vindictively. ... Nor do politicians attempt to interfere in regulatory decisions.'' <PERSON> Golay </PERSON> said much of the hostility `` is the consequence of operating in a goldfish bowl. In other countries they operate behind closed doors.'' Nuclear industry spokesman <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Peters </PERSON> agreed with the assessment of 60 percent efficiency. But in a telephone interview from the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Awareness </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, he said, `` We're getting better.'' As for cooperation among utilities, after the 1979 accident at <LOCATION> Three </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mile </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, utilities set up a computer link to share information, and the industry also has established the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Operators </ORGANIZATION>. He noted that in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, where nuclear power facilities are considered outstanding, the government owns the utility. `` That's a fairly simple relationship. Ours is more complex. The Nuclear Regulatory Commission is careful not to get too close to the industry. There's an arm's length -LRB- relationship -RRB-, as it should be,'' he said. But he added, `` I do n't think it's contributing to inefficency.''

<HEAD>Building Industry Troubled By Faulty Fire-Retardant Plywood Roofs</HEAD>

 Fire-retardant plywood used to build roofs on thousands of multiple-family dwellings nationwide can weaken and collapse after prolonged exposure to the sun's heat, building industry officials said Wednesday. `` It really is not the type of problem where people will have to worry about their roofs caving in on them at night when they're sleeping,'' said <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> <PERSON> Frost </PERSON>, a civil engineer and president of <ORGANIZATION> Frost </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Christenson </PERSON> and Associates in <LOCATION> Florham </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> But builders say the fire-retardant plywood weakens after five to six years and starts to sag, and could collapse under the weight of heavy snow. Fire-retardant plywood is marketed by several companies under various brand names. Each company uses a different compound to impregnate the wood to resist fire. The treated plywood has been used for roofing for more then a decade in multiple-family dwellings, to keep fire from bypassing firewalls and spreading easily across the roofs of adjacent apartments, but officials only recently realized there was a problem. The American <ORGANIZATION> Plywood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tacoma </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, said it first learned of the problem in 1986 when it began to get complaints from engineers. `` These were totally different than any other thing we'd ever heard about,'' said <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Zylkowski </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> APA </ORGANIZATION> scientist. `` We did n't know what to attribute the problem to. Inspectors found the problem was a chemical reaction in the fire retardant chemicals caused by the sun's heat, <PERSON> Zylkowski </PERSON> said. The chemical reaction produces an acid that weakens the wood over several years. A committee formed by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Builders </ORGANIZATION> will meet Sunday in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> to discuss a solution. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jersey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Builders </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> and the national plywood group are advising builders to refrain from using fire-retardant wood until researchers at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> laboratory in <LOCATION> Madison </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, can determine what chemicals are causing the wood deterioration. `` Until the industry comes up with meaningful controls to control their problems, we will not recommend use of their products,'' <PERSON> Zylkowski </PERSON> said. `` If they do have a problem, we recommend strongly that they get assurance from the treatment companies that the problem will not recur.'' Meanwhile, builders suggest annual inspections of roofs. Many suppliers and chemical manufacturers are working with the forest products association to develop a testing method for the fire-retardant chemicals, said <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> LeVan </PERSON>, a researcher for the group. Ms. <PERSON> LeVan </PERSON> said 6,000 specimens of plywood are being tested. `` We hope to be able to prove that if you know certain lengths of time that the wood is at elevated temperatures, we will be able to predict the life of the wood,'' she said. The next problem is who should pay for replacing faulty materials which have been used in thousands of dwellings. `` That's a $ 64,000 question,'' <PERSON> Frost </PERSON> said. `` Somewhere along the line, the courts will figure out who is responsible to fix it. There are a lot of discussions going on in the industry. I think the industry will find a solution which might require some changes.''

 After a disastrous train-school bus collision, the president on Wednesday ordered gates installed at all 758 rail crossings in <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> and guards posted at all times, a spokesman said. Presidential spokesman <PERSON> Festus </PERSON> <PERSON> Perera </PERSON> said that at a Cabinet meeting, President <PERSON> Ranasinghe </PERSON> <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON> specified that the gate installation be completed by Monday. Wailing relatives claimed most of the dead on Wednesday from the collision in southern <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> that killed at least 45 people and injured 68, most of them children. Other kin searched hospitals hoping to find their loved ones alive. M.S. <PERSON> Amarasiri </PERSON>, chief minister of the southern provincial council, said funerals were scheduled to take place Thursday. He said most homes, shops and vehicles flew white flags on Wednesday to mourn the dead. An express train slammed into a schoolbus carrying about 120 passengers Tuesday at an unprotected rail crossing near <LOCATION> Ahungalla </LOCATION>, about 50 miles south of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION>, police and witnesses said. The government said 41 people were killed outright and four died at hospitals. Authorities said most were children ranging in age from 5 to 15. Six critically injured people were brought to the capital for emergency surgery. Relatives crowded into government-run hospitals in <LOCATION> Galle </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Balapitiya </LOCATION>, where the dead and injured were taken. <PERSON> Premadasa </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Hema </PERSON>, visited the accident site and hospitals Wednesday, going from bed to bed to comfort the injured and console relatives of the dead. Many victims were mutilated beyond recognition. Nurses asked families to check clothing for identification. Police searched bloodstained schoolbooks and schoolbags for clues to identify victims. The school bus picked up children and teachers from four schools in <LOCATION> Amblangoda </LOCATION> on Tuesday and headed toward <LOCATION> Urgasmanhandiya </LOCATION>, about 10 miles away. The driver tried to cross the tracks as the train was approaching the crossing but the bus engine apparently stalled, police and witnesses said. Five children sitting on bus steps jumped to safety. The train, going about 40 mph, hit the bus and knocked it about 150 feet down the track, witnesses said. The bus driver escaped with minor cuts and bruises, police said. No one on the train was hurt, they reported.

 When devastating urban rioting hit <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> in 1980, few police officers had special training and the city paid for it. `` In 1980, we had the worst riot in the history of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. It started with murder and got worse. There were short budgets, police departments were understaffed,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON>, 46, who retired from the department as a captain in 1985. In the racial violence of 1989, however, the <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Metro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dade </ORGANIZATION> police have a plan, thanks to Green. `` I would say <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> is one of the few towns that has citizens who are disturbance-trained,'' said <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> police spokesman Sgt. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivero </PERSON>. `` They know what to do. That's an unfortunate thing to say about this town, but it's a fact.'' In 1980, when riots that killed 18 people and injured hundreds hit the <LOCATION> Liberty </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> neighborhood, the <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> police force had only 670 officers and there was no master plan. People traveling through the riot area were dragged from their cars and killed, some even mutilated. Police officers were trapped alone, barriers were n't set up properly. `` It was a whole bunch of police officers trying to do the job, but not as a cohesive group,'' said <PERSON> Green </PERSON>. `` If things could go wrong, they probably did,'' he said. `` But those lessons were well-learned.'' Today, police move in coordinated `` field force'' units, groups of eight or more cars with four men in each. Squad leaders are named. Each officer has certain duties: some watch the cars, others carry the tear gas, others drive. Whenever one car in the field force moves, all of the cars move. Quick action is taken to set up perimeters, limiting movement of people into and out of a trouble zone. <PERSON> Rivero </PERSON> says the force is trained for about 10 hours every six months. `` We go out and pretend that we're out there fighting a disturbance, have policeman posing as rioters.'' <PERSON> Green </PERSON> suggested after the 1980 riots that a new approach was needed and was told: `` You are elected. You are now known as the urban crisis officer.'' It turned out to be a prudent move. `` The biggest thing that became apparent to me was that police officers on a daily basis are trained to deal with the public in a positive manner,'' he said. `` But in a civil disorder it is the police against the citizens. `` It's difficult to go from service-oriented to a military-type approach,'' he said. He read military literature and considered the tools available. The field force system he developed for <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> became a popular one in law enforcement. <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> adopted the system. Tampa adopted elements of it. Officials from <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> have studed the approach.

 President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> splashed his inaugural limelight on school teachers Wednesday, promising to use the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> to reward excellence and raise standards in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s schools and to rivet the nation's attention on reforming education. `` I am awed by your work,'' he told 238 teachers invited from every state as special guests for the inauguration. Many of them, in turn, seemed awed by the glowing tribute from the next president. One called it `` breath-taking.'' Even under budgetary constraints, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` we're going to work to make sure that the nation does what needs to be done for our schools: reward excellence, raise standards, expand choice, publicize success, strive to resolve shortcomings and keep American attention and effort concentrated on further education reform and improvement.'' Later, at a gathering of Republican party leaders, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> paid tribute to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, declaring that he could never have won the election without his help. And, as the sun set on a warm winter's day that seemed like springtime, the president-elect presidd over a spectacular ceremony at the Lincoln Memorial that began with the blare of military trumpets and ended with the brilliant thunder of fireworks that sent a flock of geese scurrying over the Reflecting Pool. When the <ORGANIZATION> Beach </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boys </ORGANIZATION> played `` Help Me, <PERSON> Rhonda </PERSON>,'' several of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s youngest grandchildren danced before their delighted elders The ceremony featured a flyover by 21 military jets, a precision landing by four <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> parachutists, and a rendition of `` God Bless the U.S.A.'' by <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenwood </PERSON> that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said sent chills down his spine. Then <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> came forward and delivered a brief, poignant speech. He recited <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>'s words engraved on the walls of the memorial: `` Government of the people, by the people and for the people.'' `` That is the kind of government I plan to lead,'' he said. `` I will try hard to be a president of all the people.'' He paid homage to <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and his `` great presidency'' that has made <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> `` strong once again,'' but said `` the job is not complete. Some are still hurting and we care ... So let this inauguration be a time to celebrate who we are, but let it also be a time to remember who we can be.'' The crowd shone miniature flashlights at <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s command, bringing his `` thousand points of life'' to life, a symbol of `` my vision of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s greatness ... everyone who pitches in and builds up.'' From the Lincoln Memorial, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Vice President-elect <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> went to the headquarters of the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, where <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> pledged to bring the disabled into the mainstream of American life. He told the gathering of 500 people, many of them blind or in wheelchairs, that the disabled `` have been excluded for too long from the mainstream.'' He promised to `` do what I can ... to correct all of that.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> attended a reunion at his new temporary quarters at <ORGANIZATION> Blair </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> with the World War II submarine crewmen who rescued him as a downed flier in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>, then capped the day off by making the rounds of a trio of a trio of $ 1,500-a-plate inaugural dinners. But <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> chose to start the five-day whirlwind of official inaugural activities with a speech at a forum honoring 238 top teachers drawn from state teachers of the year, union leaders and others chosen by governors and <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> advisory committees. Reiterating his pledge to be `` the education president,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told the educators, `` My most important message to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s teachers is a message of appreciation. `` This is my very first event on the inaugural calendar,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told the teachers at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION> in the Arts. `` That's the way I wanted it, meeting with educators.'' `` Education will be on my desk and on my mind right from the start, every day,'' he promised. `` I am awed by your work and it is tough work and it's indispensable work and it deserves as much praise and thanks as any job in any profession in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> ... Certainly you deserve more public recognition than you usually get.'' Then, expressing a thought often spoken by his defeated Democratic rival, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, during the campaign, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> added, `` Teaching should be one of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s honored professions and I will work to make sure that it is exactly that.'' <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Parets </PERSON>, a band teacher at <ORGANIZATION> Alexis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> I. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> DuPont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Wilmington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Del. </LOCATION>, called the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> speech `` really a very breath-taking experience.'' `` I sat there thinking he could have met with the heads of foreign states, he could have met with the leaders of the military or the captains of industry and instead he chose to meet with ... teachers from across the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Parets </PERSON>, a past <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> teacher of the year whose high school band will march in the inaugural parade. Moving on to the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> luncheon where his campaign chairman, <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>, was installed as the new party chief, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> offered warm praise for <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, whom he said was leaving office with a 68 percent approval rating. `` It speaks so much about the man and his accomoplishments. ...'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` I do n't believe I'd be standing here as president eleect of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> if it had n't been for the way President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> treated me as vice president and then the way he rolled up his sleeves and went to work in many of your states helping his vice president be elected.'' `` When I go say farewell to him tomorrow, it wo n't be too easy,'' he said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also joked that he was glad to be out of the house on a day when the family belongings were being moved out of their residence of the past eight years, the Naval Observatory mansion. He said he was purposely giving his wife <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> `` a little elbow room.'' `` She's getting tough around the house,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` See a half-filled crate and she puts me to work and she's mean and tough and ugly about it. She does n't show any understanding.'' `` I do n't care if I see her for another 48 hours, because I know there'll be another crate that she -LRB- will say -RRB-: ` Move this one over here,''' he quipped. `` Getting tired of that. After all I got big responsibilities being put on my shoulders.''

<DATELINE>MANAGUA, Nicaragua (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Government troops clashed with rebels at least 20 times Jan. 9-16, and at least 17 people were killed, military sources said Wednesday. The fighting was in the southwestern provinces of <LOCATION> Boaco </LOCATION>, Chontales and <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION>. The area has been the focus of activity by the U.S.-backed rebels, known as Contras, since the rebels and the leftist Sandinista government signed a tentative cease-fire agreement last March. At least 13 rebels and four soldiers were killed and three soldiers were wounded, the sources said, speaking on condition of anonymity. The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, meanwhile, accused Honduran troops of shooting toward the border post of <LOCATION> Murupuchi </LOCATION>, in northern <LOCATION> Nueva </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Segovia </LOCATION> province, on Sunday. It mentioned no casualties. <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> says the post is harassed almost daily by Honduran troops. Col. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Suarez </PERSON> <PERSON> Benavides </PERSON>, chief spokesman for the Honduran armed forces, called the allegations `` absolutely false'' and said they `` apparently form part of a new Nicaraguan propaganda offensive against <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>.'' `` It also is completely false that Honduran troops have repeatedly harassed Sandinista forces in <LOCATION> Murupuchi </LOCATION>,'' he told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. A series of Sandinista-Contra meetings after the March 23 signing of the temporary truce failed to define terms for a permanent agreement. Talks broke off on June 9. Fighting declined sharply after the signing, which came a month after the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> cut off military aid to the Contras. Most of the rebels moved back to base camps in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, but sporadic fighting continues.

 Vice President-elect <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> praised President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Wednesday for `` a capacity to lead'' and in return received <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s public commitment that he will be included in the workings of the new administration. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, who has remained largely out of sight during the transition period, spoke briefly to members of the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> which was meeting in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> amid the inaugural festivities. He then listened as <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> described both his own treatment as vice president under <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and his plans for dealing the same way with <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. `` I do n't believe I'd be standing here as president-elect of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> if it had n't been for the way President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> treated me as vice president,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told the luncheon crowd at a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> hotel. Turning then to <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` As for my vice president, <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, I'm excited about working with him, and what we're going to do is use exactly the same formula that the Reagan-Bush team had. And he will be included.'' `` He will do specific assignments that will develop in time,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` He will take on special missions. He will have full access to the president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and he is going to be an outstanding vice president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> praised <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as `` a person of immense capabilities, integrity, knowledge and a capacity to lead. ... There is n't a better man to lead this nation forward in the challenges ahead than <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>.'' The former <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> senator spoke briefly of the administration he will be a part of, promising to `` maintain our commitment to the basic philosophical principles that brought us here.'' But he also said they must face `` the challenges of tomorrow head on.'' He cited the area of defense, `` where we will have to do more with less, we will have to be smarter.'' Later, at a ceremony at the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> told an audience of about 1,000 disabled and handicapped Americans that the new administration's commitment to them is `` deep and it is wide.'' The reception was hosted by Access to Opportunity, a bipartisan advocacy group for the disabled. The vice president-elect pledged that he and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will work to assure that the disabled will be `` included in the mainstream of American life.'' `` For too long, they've been left out, but they're not going to be left out any more,'' he said. `` I can tell you this commitment is deep and it is wide.'' `` Without aggressive public and private support disabled people can not achieve their dreams of independence, gain full control over their lives and integrate into the mainstream of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> life,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said. He said the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration will ask the private sector `` to aggressively hire disabled people'' and will educate employers about the disabled and let them know that `` disabled people perform above the average.'' He also said they would work with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to eliminate obstacles that discourage disabled people from working and support initiatives to train the disabled for jobs. `` Today, I reaffirm support for the cause of the disabled. We want to inaugurate an era of new hope and opportunity for all Americans. `` It is not only the right thing to do, it is also the smart thing to do,'' he said.

 Jury selection began Wednesday in the trial of one of two men charged in 11 sniper attacks on isolated homes in the <LOCATION> Blackstone </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> north of here. Jurors were told the trial could take six weeks and include as many as 60 witnesses. Jury selection began after <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Dominic </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cresto </PERSON> denied a motion by <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Trepanier </PERSON>'s attorneys to dismiss the charges because of lengthy trial delays. He also dismissed a defense motion to delay the trial still further because of alleged prejudicial pretrial publicity. A group of about 70 potential jurors filled the courtroom as <PERSON> Eva </PERSON> <PERSON> Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Mancuso </PERSON>, assistant attorney general, read a list of the dozens of witnesses who could be called to testify. <PERSON> Trepanier </PERSON>, 25, and a second defendant, <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ducharme </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, 24, face 39 charges each, including arson and assault with intent to commit murder. The charges stem from a series of attacks on isolated homes in the <LOCATION> Woonsocket </LOCATION> area in December 1986 and January 1987. Both men, if convicted, could face maximum sentences of life in prison. Six potential jurors Wednesday were asked if they were familar with any of the witnesses or if they had ever been victims of crimes. The prospective jurors also were questioned about whether any of the extensive publicity about the case would color their judgment. Two people were dismissed, but for unrelated personal reasons. Defense lawyers, citing pretrial publicity, tried unsuccessfully last summer to have the trial moved from <LOCATION> Providence </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Trepanier </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Burrillville </LOCATION>, surrendered to police in October 1987, 10 months after the last shooting was reported in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Smithfield </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ducharme </PERSON>, of <ORGANIZATION> Smithfield </ORGANIZATION>, was arrested and charged the next day. His trial is set to begin March 13.

 Attorneys who want to save <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> from <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s electric chair next week filed a <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> appeal Wednesday, and a hearing was scheduled for Thursday morning, court officials said. `` They've raised three claims for relief,'' said <PERSON> Carolyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Snurkowski </PERSON>, chief death penalty attorney for <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s attorney general office. Two of the arguments deal with <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON>'s murder convictions in the deaths of two sorority sisters at <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, Ms. <PERSON> Snurkowski </PERSON> said. The third deals with <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON>'s mental state. <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON>, 42, is scheduled to die Tuesday for the February 1978 murder of <PERSON> Kimberly </PERSON> <PERSON> Leach </PERSON>, a 12-year-old <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> girl.

The lawyers say that <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON>'s two other <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> cases should be linked to the <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> case on the question of his sanity. <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON>, 42, also is under death sentences for fatally bludgeoning two <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> sorority sisters three weeks before <PERSON> Leach </PERSON> was killed. In 1979, <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON> was declared legally sane to stand trial for the sorority murders. That ruling was used recently by appeals courts to reject <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON>'s claim that he is insane and should not be executed for the <PERSON> Leach </PERSON> murder. On Dec. 12, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Zloch </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION> reopened the sanity issue in the sorority case, saying he would hear evidence as early as Monday. <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON>'s lawyers say that decision leaves <PERSON> Bundy </PERSON>'s sanity in doubt and that he should not be executed until it is resolved. Defense lawyers and prosecutors have asked for a delay in the federal court hearing while they deal with the death warrant.

<TEXT>
 Suspected leftist guerrillas armed with sticks of dynamite and automatic weapons ambushed a judicial commission Wednesday, killing two judges and 11 other people, the army said. Two police officers were wounded in the attack near <LOCATION> Barrancabermeja </LOCATION>, a port city on the <LOCATION> Magdalena </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> for oil shipments, 160 miles northeast of the capital, military authorities said. The panel was investigating the October 1987 disappearance of 17 merchants along with more than $ 235,000 in goods. The commission consisted of the judges, 35-year-old <PERSON> Mariela </PERSON> <PERSON> Morales </PERSON> and 40-year-old <PERSON> Pablo </PERSON> <PERSON> Beltran </PERSON>; two secretaries, nine judicial police officers and two drivers. The two survivors arrived in <LOCATION> Barrancabermeja </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s largest eastern city, where they told authorities of the attack. `` It is an unprecedented attack on investigators who did not constitute an attack force,'' said <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Lozano </PERSON>, director of criminal judges. <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> and police reports said the attackers exploded dynamite buried under a road where two vehicles carrying the judicial commission passed by, then sprayed the group with automatic weapons fire. The two wounded officers were taken to the hospital of the state-owned oil company <ORGANIZATION> Ecopetrol </ORGANIZATION>, where officials said they were out of danger. Gen. <PERSON> Yanine </PERSON> <PERSON> Daz </PERSON>, commander of the army's Second Division, said from <LOCATION> Bucaramanga </LOCATION> that the guerrillas belonged to the Revoloutionary Armed Forces of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, or <ORGANIZATION> FARC </ORGANIZATION>, a communist group. But police blamed the attack on the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION>, or <ORGANIZATION> ELN </ORGANIZATION>, a group inspired by <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>. Both groups operate in the region, known as the central <LOCATION> Magdalena </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> area. Ultra-right paramilitary groups claiming to fight subversives and leftist collaborators have also been known to operate in the area. It is the first time leftist guerrillas were blamed for killing judicial officials, although drug traffickers have killed <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> magistrates and judges investigating drug-related crimes.

<HEAD>Order Could Shield White House Papers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By W. DALE NELSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s successors would have the power to shield portions of the papers of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> presidency from disclosure, under an executive order issued by the president Wednesday. The order spells out procedures to be followed by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and other former presidents in claiming executive privilege with regard to their presidential papers. These claims would be subject to review by the archivist, but the archivist would be bound by any instructions given him by the incumbent president unless otherwise instructed by court order. Thus, if <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> asserted executive privilege to keep some of his papers under wraps, and a later president supported him, the archivist would be prohibited from disclosing them unless ordered by a court. The order arises out of protracted litigation over claims of executive privilege by former President <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> with regard to his papers. A <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> opinion in 1986 said the archivist is a presidential appointee and must comply with the president's claim of privilege, even when it is invoked in support of a former president. That opinion also said an incumbent president was bound to support an executive privilege claim by a former president, except in rare cases when it would conflict with his constitutional duties. The opinion touched off criticism in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, where some lawmakers said it would let <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and future presidents keep their own papers under seal years after they have left office. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s order establishes procedures governing the assertion of executive privilege by both present and former presidents. It provides that when the archivist decides on release of papers of a former president, he would notify both the former president and the incumbent, identifying any materials he thinks might be subject to executive privilege. The incumbent and former presidents, however, would be free to assert executive privilege with regard to any papers, whether or not identified by the archivist. The archivist would be free to release the papers if he did not receive a claim of executive privilege within 30 days. If he received such a claim from the incumbent president, he would be prohibited from disclosing the records unless directed to do so by the president or a final court order. When he received a claim of privilege by a former president, the archivist would consult with the attorney general and the counsel to the president and then make a `` determination as to whether to honor the former president's claim of privilege or instead to disclose the presidential records notwithstanding the claim of privilege.'' `` Any determination ... that executive privilege shall not be invoked by the incumbent president shall not prejudice the archivist's determination with respect to the former president's claim of privilege,'' the order said However, it said, `` In making the determination ... the archivist shall abide by any instructions given him by the incumbent president or his designee unless otherwise directed by a final court order.'' All presidents before <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> took their papers with them when they left office, but under a 1978 law <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s documents and those of his successors will become public property. That law requires the archivist to decide which papers to withhold and which to make public 12 years after a president leaves office.

 <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> will drop barriers to imports of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wine and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> vintners have dropped their plea to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> for action against the barriers, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Trade Representative <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> announced Wednesday. `` The agreement opens an important new market for American wine at an early stage in that market's development and it assures that our wine industry can compete fairly with Korean wine producers,'' said a statement by <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON>, who will be <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> secretary in the incoming <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration. The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> had appealed to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> under a law which lets him retaliate against the trade of countries that damage or threaten <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> industry. According to the announcement, the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> government is to lift immediately its ban on wine coolers, dessert wines and fortified wines, and will double its import quota for all wine products. Beginning in 1990, it will lift restrictions on table wines, wine coolers -- mixtures of wine and fruit juice -- and fruit-flavored wines. <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON> added that the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> government has agreed to ask the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> to lower the tax rate on wine coolers to 25 percent from 40 percent. In January 1991 the ban on champagne and brandy will disappear. Early last year, the South Korean tariff on wine products stood at 100 percent of their value. The current rate of 50 percent will drop to 35 percent in July and to 30 percent in January 1990. The rate on wine coolers will drop to 25 percent. <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON>'s announcement said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> products will have equal access to the South Korean distribution system and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies will have the right to set up their own networks for <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> products, through Korean agents. In 1991 Americans will get the right to invest directly in importing and wholesale activities on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wines. It took three rounds of negotiations to settle the dispute. The agreement on Wednesday was contained in an exchange of letters, <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON>'s office said.

 Members of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday demanded a tougher judiciary system that would crack down on widespread corruption, the <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> reported. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s official news agency, monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, said a letter to the judiciary signed by 190 lawmakers read, `` It is in the interest of the county to strengthen the judiciary as soon as possible according to the leader of the Islamic revolution, <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>.'' <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> said the letter advised the judiciary to heed the warning, adding that failure to do so could cause irreparable harm. The call reflects public concern over government graft and other issues put to one side after the Iran-Iraq war began in September 1980. Parliament deputy <PERSON> Rajai </PERSON> <PERSON> Khorasani </PERSON> told students in northwestern <LOCATION> Tabriz </LOCATION> province last month that corruption was a major reason for <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s agreeing to a U.N.-mediated cease-fire last August. Last month <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> came under attack for voting down a bill demanding that all government officials' incomes be investigated. Members opposing the measure, among them Speaker <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, said it was too far-reaching in requiring that medium-level officials such as bank managers and heads of state-owned corporations be investigated. In an effort to demonstrate a tough stand on corruption, however, the government last month sentenced multimillionaire <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Mousavi </PERSON> to death for defrauding war victims' families. Also, an Expediency Council formed by <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON> to expedite legislation bypassed both judiciary and <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> in passing a draconian law against drug smugglers. The new law, to take effect at the end of this week, carries a death sentence for anyone found in possession of more than 30 grams -LRB- just over one ounce -RRB- of specified hard drugs and 11 pounds of any narcotic. According to <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> television reports, also monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, the public welcomed the crackdown. Already, 75 people have been hanged in advance of the new law, and hundreds of tons of narcotics have been seized.

Strong testified that when he asked her where she had been, she told him it was none of his business. He also said that during the argument, which erupted as Mrs. Strong was sitting in the kitchen doing her hair, she reached into her bag and `` put on a pair of brass knuckles.'' Strong pulled out the gun, which he claimed he never intended to use, and in the ensuing scuffle, the gun went off. Strong said he could n't account for the other three shots.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Panasonic </ORGANIZATION> agreed Wednesday to refund up to $ 16 million to settle charges that the Japanese electronics company cheated consumers nationwide by fixing prices, the state attorney general said. The scam `` elevated prices by an average of 5 to 10 percent on many of its products,'' Attorney General <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> said at a news conference. `` In a few short months over $ 15 million was extorted from consumers in the form of higher prices.'' The alleged scheme involved 16 products sold under the Panasonic and <ORGANIZATION> Technics </ORGANIZATION> labels, including videocassette recorders, videotape cameras, cordless telephones, answering machines and stereo equipment, <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> said. In the settlement filed in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Panasonic </ORGANIZATION> agreed to make refunds to 665,000 consumers nationwide who purchased <ORGANIZATION> Panasonic </ORGANIZATION> products between March 1 and Aug. 31, 1988. <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> said the company began the scheme in March, but ended it after six months when it learned of his investigation. <ORGANIZATION> Panasonic </ORGANIZATION> had planned to extend the scheme to eventually include all of its products, <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Panasonic </ORGANIZATION> coerced retailers into charging full list prices for its products by threatening to stop supplying stores that sold its equipment below the suggested retail price, he said. The attorney general described `` an elaborate nationwide scheme involving scores of <ORGANIZATION> Panasonic </ORGANIZATION> sales executives pressuring thousands of retailers throughout the country to comply with the scheme and then <ORGANIZATION> Panasonic </ORGANIZATION> actually monitoring the prices that they charged.'' Panasonic denied any wrongdoing, but agreed to make the refunds. `` We voluntarily resolved the matter in the belief that a quick settlement would help avoid protracted and costly litigation and disruption to our dealers and our business,'' said <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolfe </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Panasonic </ORGANIZATION> vice president. Consumers who bought any of the products during the six months of the alleged scheme and sent in warranty cards will be notified they are eligible for a refund and mailed the necessary forms.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> president said Wednesday that ousted President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> has offered to return an undisclosed amount of money stashed in <LOCATION> Swiss </LOCATION> banks in exchange for permission to return home. Sen. <PERSON> Jovito </PERSON> <PERSON> Salonga </PERSON> said the offer was made in an August letter and was the second such offer made by <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>. <PERSON> Salonga </PERSON> formerly headed a government body charged with recovering <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' fortune. Presidential Executive Secretary <PERSON> Catalino </PERSON> <PERSON> Macaraig </PERSON> confirmed that a proposal to return $ 5 billion was made in July but was rejected by the government, which says <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, his family and associates illegally garnered up to $ 10 billion during his 20-year presidency. President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> said on Wednesday she had received no formal, unequivocal offers directly from <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>. She had said she would let <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> return only if he returned money obtained illegally while in office. `` It -LRB- <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' offer -RRB- was not very clear. It was coursed through third parties and there was not anything definite ... Until things are put down in writing and formally addressed to me, I guess we can not really study the matter,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> told reporters. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, 71, was toppled in the February 1986 `` People's Power'' uprising that swept Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> into power and forced <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> into Hawaiian exile. `` He -LRB- <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> -RRB- signed a document ... offering to transfer to the <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> government the disputed funds in the Swiss banks,'' <PERSON> Salonga </PERSON> told reporters. `` No amount was indicated in the letter.'' <PERSON> Salonga </PERSON> said the letter was signed in the presence of an <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinstein </PERSON>, an American professor who was to `` act as a representative -LRB- of <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> -RRB- to deal with the <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> government,'' <PERSON> Salonga </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> faces 39 civil cases in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> involving embezzlement. No criminal charges have been filed against <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> or his family. Philippine laws prohibit trial in the absence of the defendant. On Oct. 21, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> federal grand jury indicted <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, his wife, <PERSON> Imelda </PERSON>, and eight other associates on racketeering charges. They were accused of plundering their homeland of $ 103 million to buy <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> real estate and defrauding <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> banks of more than $ 165 million between 1972-1986. Mrs. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> pleaded not guilty. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' lawyers told a federal judge in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> on Wednesday he is unable to stand trial there on racketeering charges because he is dying. The <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> government has refused to allow the Marcoses to return for fear that their civilian and military supporters would undermine the 35-month old <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> administration. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> has faced at least five coup attempts, mostly from troops loyal to <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>.

 A broken home, a history of childhood drinking and a criminal record might have been warnings. But authorities said Wednesday they may never know why <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Purdy </PERSON> attacked a schoolyard full of children with an assault rifle. <PERSON> Purdy </PERSON>, a loner who often worked as a welder in his travels around the country, apparently lived in a bizarre fantasy world involving the military and the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. When he slipped onto the <ORGANIZATION> Cleveland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> grounds shortly before noon Tuesday, he was wearing a flak jacket and an olive drab T-shirt with the words `` Death to the Great Satin'' _ not Satan _ on the back and `` <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>,'' `` <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>'' and `` Earthman'' also written on it. In a room at the <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rancho </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Motel </LOCATION>, where he lived in the weeks leading up to the massacre, police found about 100 plastic toy soldiers, a broken .22 - caliber rifle and an olive drab cloth bearing drawings of `` three snarling-type faces'' and the words `` V for victory'' and `` F for freedom His weapons bore similar markings, including the word `` <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>,'' the name of a pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem faction in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. `` What the significance of that is I do not know,'' said <PERSON> Stockton </PERSON> Police Capt. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> on Wednesday. `` He obviously had a military hangup of some kind. `` It suggests that this guy may have had delusions of grandeur about <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>,'' he said. <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> said <PERSON> Purdy </PERSON> was arrested in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> in 1980 on charges involving prostitution, in 1982 by <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> sheriff's deputies on a marijuana charge, in 1983 in <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> for manufacture or sale of an illegal weapon, in 1983 by <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> deputies for receiving stolen property and in <LOCATION> Woodland </LOCATION>, about 50 miles north of here, on a robbery charge <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> did not know the disposition of some of those cases, but said <PERSON> Purdy </PERSON> served jail time in the last two cases. <PERSON> Julia </PERSON> <PERSON> Chumbley </PERSON>, <PERSON> Purdy </PERSON>'s 63-year-old grandmother, figures <PERSON> Purdy </PERSON>'s motive died with him when he took his own life Tuesday in <LOCATION> Stockton </LOCATION>, 15 miles south of her home in <LOCATION> Lodi </LOCATION> in the farming-rich <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Joaquin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> `` I do n't understand why and I probably wo n't ever know why,'' said <PERSON> Chumbley </PERSON>, a retired cannery worker, in a telephone interview. An aunt, <PERSON> Julie </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> of </PERSON> <PERSON> Sandy </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, said that despite being the product of a broken home and having a criminal record and a history of childhood alcoholism, <PERSON> Purdy </PERSON> did not display hate or other outward signs of impending disaster. `` When he was around here, he acted well,'' <PERSON> Chumbley </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Chumbley </PERSON> said her grandson, who also went by the alias <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> West </PERSON>, had only a normal interest in guns as a child. `` All boys that age like guns,'' she said. `` It's normal for that age, is n't it?'' <PERSON> Purdy </PERSON>'s father, <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Purdy </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Lodi </LOCATION> cab company employee, was struck and killed by a car in September 1981. The death disturbed the younger <PERSON> Purdy </PERSON>, but <PERSON> Chumbley </PERSON> said he seemed to have recovered from the loss. As for why most of the victims were Southeast Asian refugees, <PERSON> Chumbley </PERSON> said, `` As far as I know, he was not prejudiced. We're not a prejudiced family. We were n't raised that way.'' She said his parents were married in <PERSON> Stockton </PERSON>, then divorced after a short time. His mother remarried and took <PERSON> Purdy </PERSON> to the <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tahoe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nev. </LOCATION>, region and then on to the <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION> area. He dropped out of high school and began drifting, living briefly in several communities, she said. In <PERSON> Stockton </PERSON>, his grandmother remembers a girlfriend. `` But that was some time ago,'' she added. In June, <PERSON> Purdy </PERSON> traveled to <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> where he worked in <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION> as a welder for a time, lived with an aunt and uncle and bought the assault rifle, then continued on to <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and finally <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Chumbley </PERSON> said. `` That's where I sent his Christmas present. I thought he was still there. I did n't even know he was back,'' she said.

 A <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader said Wednesday the way is clear to make the Solidarity trade union legal again. Gen. <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> won a vote of confidence after offering to resign in a bitter internal fight. The policy-making <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>'s vote of confidence kept <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON>, party leader and head of state, in power on the second day of a meeting in which the party debated union freedoms, the official <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> news agency said. The meeting led to a party resolution that paves the way for the relegalization of Solidarity, said chief party ideologist <PERSON> Marian </PERSON> <PERSON> Orzechowski </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> and other key members of the ruling Politburo, including Prime Minister <PERSON> Mieczyslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> and Interior Minister Gen. <PERSON> Czeslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiszczak </PERSON>, offered to give up their party and government posts, <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> said. In an unusual description of the heated debate, <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> reported `` accusations that party policy was incomprehensible, faulty and often contradictory of the expectations and view of party members.'' <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> said the doubts of the 230-member <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> were justified by the `` bad experiences'' of 1980-1981. Solidarity, the Soviet bloc's first independent union movement, was formed during labor unrest in 1980, crushed with martial law in 1981 and outlawed in 1982. The 230-member <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> gave <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> and the other leaders a vote of confidence with only four abstentions. It was the first time the government reported such a resignation offer, suggesting growing official openness. <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> said the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> passed a position paper on political and union freedoms by a vote of 143-32, with 14 abstentions. The text was not released, but <PERSON> Orzechowski </PERSON> told state radio it was a `` great turning point.'' `` It opens the road to restoration of trade union pluralism, including Solidarity, formulating at the same time a number of conditions which have to be fulfilled so the road is not too bumpy,'' <PERSON> Orzechowski </PERSON> said. `` We do n't know the reaction of the other side yet,'' he said. Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> had insisted on a clear party statement of its willingness to recognize his union before he would enter talks with the government on <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s future. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> that the Polish leadership's `` stated willingness to relegalize the Solidarity trade union under certain conditions is a step forward. ... Relegalization would be a major achievement on the road to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s reform and recovery. We would welcome it.'' <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> had asked the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> for a green light to offer to restore the union's legal status for a two-year trial period on condition it help the government in its economic and political reforms. <PERSON> Orzechowski </PERSON> said the conditions `` stem from our experiences and from the foreseen potential effects of the developing events.'' He urged the opposition to show a `` sense of responsiblity.'' A draft of the original resolution on trade union freedoms obtained by Western news agencies said that at proposed talks with the opposition, `` the organizational forms of expanded national reconciliation should be determined.'' `` There should also be agreed conditions, means and a schedule of introducing trade union pluralism, and opening the road for creation of new trade unions, including Solidarity.'' It was not known if the language concerning Solidarity was altered during the party debate in which many Central Committee members spoke against Solidarity. Solidarity has remained active despite the ban, first as an underground organization and later increasingly tolerated by authorities. Recently, <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> has been treated as a member of the `` constructive opposition'' whose views are carried in the media. Officials have said they would like Solidarity's support in maintaining calm as the government introduces its potentially disruptive reforms. Officials believe an agreement with Solidarity would also help the government obtain badly needed Western credits. On Tuesday, <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> urged a conditional offer of legalization to Solidarity so long as the union agrees to act as a partner, not a `` political opponent.'' He said Solidarity would have to declare itself a part of socialism and disassociate itself from anti-communist groups, observe a strike moratorium and give up financial assistance from the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>, which has amounted to millions of dollars. Legalization would come only after the two-year probationary period when both sides would evaluate `` positive and negative experiences,'' <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> said. A Solidarity source in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> said privately that the conditions set by <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> initially appeared `` unacceptable.'' But <PERSON> Krzysztof </PERSON> <PERSON> Sliwinski </PERSON>, an independent journalist associated with Solidarity, was more optimistic. Emphasizing that he was giving his own view and not the union's, <PERSON> Sliwinski </PERSON> said, `` It seems to be a commitment to recognize Solidarity. So I would would consider it an important first step that was very difficult for them.'' <PERSON> Sliwinski </PERSON> said the most difficult condition for the union to accept would be a moratorium on striking, which <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> suggested should last two years. `` <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> has said many times that he does not want to organize strikes,'' <PERSON> Sliwinski </PERSON> said. `` But without the right to strike there is no use being a union.'' True partnership with the government would be impossible under those conditions `` because all the power is on the other side,'' he said.

 The new <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration may raise quotas for refugees in light of rising numbers of people wanting to come to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> from such places as the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, Secretary of State-designate <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> said Wednesday. `` We will have to look at the possibility of increasing numbers and of increasing dollars'' for the refugee program, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said at his confirmation hearing before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Foreign Relations Committee. In addition, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said, the problem of the glut of refugees in first-asylum countries _ the places they gather after leaving their homelands to await permanent moves _ `` will occupy our time and attention'' early in the new administration. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s comments came as he underwent a second day of friendly questioning on his nomination to lead the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> in the new administration. The full committee was expected to vote to approve his appointment on Thursday, and the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> was scheduled to meet Jan. 25 to act on that and other nominations. On other subjects: _ Responding to questions about two long-pending treaties with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said agreement is complete on verification procedures for the 1976 Peaceful Nuclear Explosions Treaty and nearly complete on verification rules for the 1974 Nuclear Test Ban Treaty The two will be sent together to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> for ratification, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said, but he declined to say when. _ <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said he had reservations about <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> participation in a scheduled 1991 international human rights conference in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, but he added, `` We made a commitment and we plan to keep it'' so long as conditions for improvements in Soviet human rights performance are met _ Asked how he interprets changes being made by Soviet Leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, in regard to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s approach to the rest of the world, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said, `` The jury is still out That's why ... we should approach our relationship with prudence and a certain degree of realism.'' _ He said he was `` not in a position to prejudge what we would do'' if <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, applied for a visa to visit the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> rejected such a request from <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> last November, but <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> has since made statements more to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials' liking concerning terrorism and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. _ Answering a question prompted by documents at the heart of the Iran-Contra affair, he said he believed all of the officials who by law are members of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> _ the president, the vice president and the secretaries of <ORGANIZATION> state </ORGANIZATION> and defense _ should be informed of presidential decisions to undertake covert actions overseas _ <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said he believed that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, as a former <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> ambassador, would be inclined to include in his budget request not only full funding for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> share of the world body's operating costs, but also installments on paying back dues accumulated during the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> `` is very skillful, as he should be, and I'm impressed,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kassebaum </PERSON>, R-Kan., expressing a view apparently shared by many panel members `` I think he's going to make an excellent secretary of state and I'm ready to vote,'' added Sen. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanford </PERSON>, D-N.C. On the subject of refugees, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said last week that the quota for Soviet and other East European refugees would be raised by 7,000 this year and the quota for Vietnamese refugees would be lowered because many of the Vietnamese are former political prisoners unable to emigrate. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said the plight of some Vietnamese was `` a major problem.'' Closer to home, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said he was unaware of reports cited by Sen. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.C. </LOCATION>, that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, through the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> or some other avenue, is covertly financing the campaign of the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>'s presidential elections scheduled for March. `` I'm not familiar with what you have suggested is taking place,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> told <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>. He said he generally does not approve of covert <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> funding of political campaigns in other countries, but said that on occasions it could be appropriate to defeat `` parties or personalities inimical to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' On still another subject, responding to a question from Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerry </PERSON>, D-Mass., <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said, `` I think you will see a new approach toward acid rain from this administration,'' although he did not say what that approach would be The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration often was criticized, particularly by <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, for dragging its feet on taking action to mitigate the problem.

 About 2,500 Republican stalwarts and wealthy contributors feasted on a $ 1,500-a-plate dinner and toasted <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s presidency Wednesday night, unmindful of noisy protesters outside who chanted `` Feed The Poor, Not the Rich'' and `` What About the Homeless?'' Two days before their inauguration, the president-elect and his Vice President-elect, <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, toured the lavish dinners at three sites around the city, including the newly refurbished Union Station where dozens of street people ate hot chili and rice from a makeshift soup kitchen on the plaza out in front. Inside, the black-tie guests expressed little concern about the message the demonstraters were shouting. `` I feel it's ridiculous,'' said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> business executive. `` They hold these staged events every time Republicans get together and it's in very poor taste.'' `` The people here have probably contributed more as individuals and corporations to the welfare of this country than anybody else,'' said <LOCATION> Tulsa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Okla. </LOCATION>, oilman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hewgley </PERSON>. `` If they want to celebrate, then, by <PERSON> God </PERSON>, they're entitled to.'' Several hundred protesters demonstrated for three hours, shouting at the limousines that pulled up to the main entrance at Union Station with inaugural dinner guests, but dispersed peaceably as the dinner began in mid-evening. Three hours before the start of the Union Station dinner, several hundred street people enjoyed a `` counter Inaugural banquet'' of hot chili and rice, tortilla chips, salad and apple cider on the plaza in front of Union Station. While they ate off of paper plates, the homeless listened to guitar players and watched a pro-abortion street theater featuring a man in tennis shoes wearing a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> mask and a sign reading, `` I oppose abortion'' hanging around his neck. Protesters organized by a group called, `` The Counter-Inaugural Coalition for a Peoples' Agenda,'' carried placards reading, `` Food, Not Bombs,'' `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Knew </PERSON>'' and `` The Skies Are for Stars, Not War.'' Another sign under a huge peace symbol read, `` Now Appearing In a Four-Year Show, Son of <LOCATION> Reaganstein </LOCATION>, co-starring Big Bird.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> were guests of honor at the lavish dinners attended by more than 2,500 Republican stalwarts and fat-cat contributors. The black-tie crowd was so large the dinners were held at Union Station and the nearby Pension Building and Corcoran Gallery of Art. For $ 1,500 ticket, each invited guest was to hear brief remarks by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> at the three dinner sites and feast on a four-course dinner. Outside of Union Station, Park Police Sgt. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kass </PERSON> banished a half dozen conservative Republican counter-demonstrators for lack of a permit. The leader of the group, <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Delgaudio </PERSON>, 34, executive director of the private, ultra-conservative activists group known as `` Public Advocate,'' said he wanted to show `` there's a better way than openly, political negativism.'' He said his demonstrators were to welcome the black-tie dinner guests with <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> flags and signs reading, `` Welcome Non-Liberals.'' Several homeless people paused between spoonfuls of chili to say that the $ 2.25 million in proceeds from the inaugural dinners should be spent to provide food, additional shelters, job training and subsidized public transportation for <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s street people. Referring to the inaugural diners, <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON> <PERSON> Carrington </PERSON>, a 30-year-old homeless person, said, `` I think maybe they should eat the same thing we're having so they'll know what it's like.'' Said <PERSON> Ronnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, 38: `` They done robbed most of it from us.'' He said the inaugural dinner proceeds should be used for the homeless because `` a lot of them have given up.'' More than 1,000 people were served at the counter-inaugural dinner at Union Station. As guests began arriving shortly before 7 p.m., several hundred of the people at the counter-inaugural banquet began shouting, `` What about the homeless'' and `` 50,000 dead from AIDS. Where was <PERSON> George </PERSON>?'' Although the Park Police allowed the demonstration to spread closer to the train depot than the demonstrators' permit allowed, the protestors remained 100 yards from the entrance where the invited guests were emerging from their cars and were barely audible from that distance. At about 7:30 p.m., one half hour before the Union Station banquet would get officially underway, the Park Police received reinforcement and barricades which were set up in front of the demonstrators. Park Police Sgt. <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON>, asked whether the barricades had been planned in advance, said, `` I'm not in on these decisions, but I imagine it was spontaneous because of the crowd's activity ... we ca n't have the police spread out or people can sneak through. We should have had them up there before.'' There was no indication that any of the invited guests to the Union Station dinner were even aware of the demonstration. None of them came over to see what is going on. At the majestic <ORGANIZATION> Corcoran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gallery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION>, dinner guests who also paid $ 1,500 each were serenaded up a royal blue carpeted stairway by violins playing, `` This Could Be The Start of Something Big.'' Elegantly attired guests wandered through art displays ranging from modern neon art to traditional American pieces. The gallery was hung with blue bunting with white stars and large arrangements of red roses decorated the corridors. Among the guests at the Corcoran gala dinner were <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s longtime friend and Commerce secretary-designate, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON>'s socialite wife <PERSON> Georgette </PERSON>. Mrs. <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON>, like Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Mrs. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was dressed in a black-and-white gown. Also among the guests were Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Warner </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Va </LOCATION>., and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s son, <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON>, and his wife, The younger <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he was having fun, but mostly waiting for Friday's swearing in of his father. `` The rest will be fun,'' he said, adding, however, `` the one we will all be looking forward to will be Friday - an incredibly proud moment for all of us.'' His wife, who wore a fitted, strapless black gown with a brocade bodice, said she had never seen <PERSON> George </PERSON> and <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> so excited as they have been with the inauguration approaching. `` They're like two kids,'' she said.

<HEAD>Bush Promises to Reach Out to Americans `Still Hurting'</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, beginning an inaugural whirlwind in solemn remembrance and thunderous celebration, promised Wednesday a government that will reach out to Americans `` still hurting'' despite the recovery of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> era. Addressing an exultant throng gathered at the <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> invoked the words chiseled onto its walls when he said `` ` government of the people, by the people and for the people' ... is the kind of government I plan to lead'' upon taking the presidential oath Friday. On the first of five days of inaugural activity, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also paid parting tribute to <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, his political mentor, and promised all the nation's teachers that education `` will be on my desk and on my mind'' from the moment he becomes president. At the majestic monument to <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>, as evening fell upon an unusually warm, clear day, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said `` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is strong once again, we are respected around the world ... our children are being born into a land of oppoortunity. `` But the job is not complete,'' he declared. `` Some are still hurting. And we care.'' `` Many important tasks lie ahead,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` Let us rekindle the flame of confidence and commitment so that we can accomplish the great goals we have yet to achieve.'' With that, he ignited his inaugural flame as well, triggering a massive fireworks display in keeping with his concept of the nation's diversity and promise as `` a thousand points of light.'' <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> estimated the crowd at 250,000; inaugural organizers put it at 40,000. It was a day bursting with moments of quiet reflection as well as pomp and promises. Memories were stirred in a private meeting with old <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> comrades who saved his life in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> 44 years earlier. Before the night was out, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, his wife <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> donned their formal wear and dropped in on three separate $ 1,500-per-plate dinners for thousands of Republican high rollers, noting that their contributions helped finance several inaugural shows free to the public. At one location, the renovated Union Station, homeless people lined up outside for a soup-kitchen meal served by anti-poverty activists while the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> guests dined on <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> crab and roast pork. A glowing <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told the swank assemblage at the Corcoran Gallery of Art that `` It's just beginning to set in'' that he will be president on Friday. `` It's so hard to describe,'' he said. At Union Station, he joked that `` The Bushes and Quayles wo n't interrupt this dinner for long. We ca n't. We're exhausted.'' The two women wore matching black and white _ Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in a gown with long-sleeve white top, swirled with rhinestones, and a black A-line skirt tied with a sash; the wife of the Vice President-elect in a wrap-style gown with fitted bodice and flowing skirt. The outdoor pageant produced the only thunder of a picture-perfect day _ a flyover by 21 <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> combat jets, the Good Vibrations of the Beach Boys, the bombs bursting in air, in electric-white glare. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was accompanied there, too, by his wife and the Quayles. For that occasion, the women wore matching, shocking-red coats; Mrs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> topped hers with a huge, Stars-and-Stripes scarf. President and <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, meanwhile, officially bade farewell to hundreds of White House staffers. `` We were all revolutionaries, and the revolution has been a success,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told 350 aides. Tears streamed down <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s face as the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Band </ORGANIZATION> played `` <LOCATION> Auld </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lang </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Syne </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told a meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> that `` I do n't believe I'd be standing here as president-elect of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> if it had n't been for the way President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> treated me as vice president, and then the way he rolled up his sleeves and went to work ... helping his vice president be elected. `` When I go say farewell to him tomorrow, it wo n't be too easy,'' he said. `` We're not coming in to correct the ills of the past. We're coming in to build on a proud record.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> began the day with an address to <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s educators. `` This is my very first event on the inaugural calendar. ... That's the way I wanted it,'' he told 230 top-rated public school teachers, gathered from every state. `` I know you've heard me say during this campaign that I intended to be the education president. Two days before I begin trying I wanted you to know that I meant it.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who attended the exclusive <ORGANIZATION> Phillips </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Andover </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, and earned his college degree and Phi Beta Kappa key at <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION>, told the teachers: `` I am awed by your work.'' `` Education will be on my desk and on my mind right from the start,'' he said. With two days to go before he is sworn in, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was all over town. First off, he moved from the vice presidential mansion into lodgings closer to the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, then set off on a schedule crammed with social events, including the reunion with his <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> rescuers more than 44 years ago. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> joked, meanwhile, that he was giving wife <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> `` a little elbow room'' while she was still in the throes of moving. `` I do n't care if I see her for another 48 hours, because I know there'll be another crate that she -LRB- will say -RRB-: ` Move this one over here. He paused, and added: `` I'm getting tired of that. After all, I've got big responsibilities.'' In private, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> embraced 16 surviving crew members of the USS Finback, a World War II submarine which rescued him after he bailed out when his TBM Avenger torpedo bomber was struck by Japanese fire. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who has accorded the Finback veterans the choicest seats at several inaugural events, welcomed them to his temporary quarters at the <ORGANIZATION> Blair </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> to renew memories. One, <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohler </PERSON>, of <ORGANIZATION> Rogers </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Ark. </LOCATION>, the torpedoman who pulled <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> from the drink, said `` It was very emotional. You have to remember that very few of us had seen any of the others for 44 years.'' <PERSON> Kohler </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told the group that `` his relationships in the war helped him a great deal in guiding his life.'' Another recollection, according to retired Rear Adm. <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Heyworth </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, once the Finback's gunnery officer, was that the crew nicknamed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` Ellie'' for `` his outstanding imitation of an elephant trumpeting.'' That was n't the stunt of an aspiring Republican. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, then 20, merely had seen too many `` Tarzan'' movies in the wardroom. In his remarks to the school teachers, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said that even under budgetary constraints, `` We're going to work to make sure that the nation does what needs to be done for our schools: reward excellence, weigh standards, expand choice, publicize success, strive to resolve shortcomings.'' <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Parets </PERSON>, a band teacher at <ORGANIZATION> Alexis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> I. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> DuPont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Wilmington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Del. </LOCATION>, said, `` I was very moved. I sat there thinking he could have met with the heads of foreign states, he could have met with the leaders of the military or the captains of industry and instead he chose to meet with 230 teachers from across the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.''

 Two <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> cadets on Christmas vacation robbed an armored car of $ 4.5 million in a plan conceived by one cadet's father, authorities said Wednesday in announcing their arrests. The father, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jasinski </PERSON>, 51, of <LOCATION> Boonton </LOCATION> was a part-time driver for the <ORGANIZATION> Coin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Depot </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armored </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Car </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> when one of its trucks was robbed Dec. 22 in <LOCATION> Clifton </LOCATION> by two men dressed as police officers. The two `` policemen'' were <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jasinski </PERSON>, 22, and <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> <PERSON> Smals </PERSON>, 21, of <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, cadets at the <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, miltary school, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McGinley </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION> agency. The elder <PERSON> Jasinski </PERSON> met the hijacked armored car in a rented van, to which the money was transferred; the police uniforms were rented from a costume store in <LOCATION> Paramus </LOCATION>, <PERSON> McGinley </PERSON> said at a news conference. A `` majority'' of the money was recovered from an attic crawl space at the home of a woman acquaintance of the elder <PERSON> Jasinski </PERSON>, <PERSON> McGinley </PERSON> said. The woman, whom he did not identify, did not know what <PERSON> Jasinski </PERSON> was storing and did not participate in the crime, <PERSON> McGinley </PERSON> said. The money, displayed with a 9mm automatic, was in a dozen plastic garbage bags and a footlocker. <PERSON> McGinley </PERSON> said the cadets were arrested at their campus Wednesday. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Jasinski </PERSON>, a retired telephone company worker, was arrested at his home and held on $ 400,000 bail. The lawyer who represented the elder <PERSON> Jasinski </PERSON>, <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartnett </PERSON>, declined to comment on the charges. All three were charged with interference with commerce by threats or violence, which carries a 20-year prison term upon conviction. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Jasinski </PERSON>, a senior, and <PERSON> Smals </PERSON>, a sophomore, were friends on vacation from the military school when the crime was committed, said <PERSON> McGinley </PERSON>. The complaint said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jasinski </PERSON> was interviewed by an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent on Tuesday and at first denied the allegation. He later admitted planning the robbery and implicated the cadets, the complaint said. In <LOCATION> Roanoke </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, Wednesday night, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Magistrate <PERSON> Glen </PERSON> <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON> ordered the younger <PERSON> Jasinski </PERSON> and Smals held without bond pending their transfer to <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> said <PERSON> Jasinski </PERSON> and <PERSON> Smals </PERSON> confessed to the heist when they were questioned at <ORGANIZATION> VMI </ORGANIZATION> following their arrests, and both cadets also admitted their guilt at the bond hearing. `` The complaint is correct, sir,'' <PERSON> Jasinski </PERSON> told <PERSON> Conrad </PERSON> at the hearing. <PERSON> McGinley </PERSON> said an investigation of employees after the robbery was `` instrumental'' in cracking the case. He said <PERSON> Jasinski </PERSON> drove the same route as the robbed truck. Authorities said the two robbers held up three employees of <ORGANIZATION> Coin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Depot </ORGANIZATION> as they parked an armored car behind the <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fidelity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. The car was to bring the cash to the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION>. They handcuffed the employees and drove them to a nearby industrial park, freeing the three unharmed. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> said the robbers wore police-type clothing, including three-quarter length blue nylon coats with fur collars, blue police caps and police badges.

 Volcanoes killed more people in the'80s than during the previous 78 years, yet the deadly peaks are inadequately monitored to protect 350 million people who live near their slopes, a geologist says. `` We have to do a better job of studying the volcanoes of the world,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Tilling </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Geological Survey geologist who coordinated the agency's response to the <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Helens </LOCATION> eruption. `` Existing methods of monitoring volcanoes are proving relatively reliable.

Since A.D. 1000 more than 300,000 people died from volcanic flows _ lava, pyroclastic or mud _ tsunamis and post-eruption starvation, Tilling said in a summary of his remarks for today's annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. Mudflows from <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s Nevado del Ruiz killed at least 22,000 people in 1985, while more than 2,000 perished in pyroclastic flows _ blasts of hot gas, rock and ash _ from <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chichon </LOCATION> in 1982, Tilling said.

<HEAD>Americans, Earth And Peace Themes Of Inaugural Worship</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE W. CORNELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Religion Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Caring _ for the people of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, for God's creation and for reconciliation of the nations of the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> _ is the credo of a special worship service marking the inauguration of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as president. A litany for it, expected to echo in many churches across the country at his suggestion, goes in part: `` O God of all goodness and grace ... grant us ... a teachable and humble spirit ... a heart that mourns with those who suffer ... faith that the world shall not be inherited by the violent ... but by those whom gentleness makes great.'' At <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s wishes, the worship is to crown weekend inaugural events this Sunday at the National Cathedral, the Episcopal center in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and the denomination of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and his family. `` He wants the inaugural to culminate not with fireworks but with prayer,'' his wife, <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON>, told planners. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, his family and an ecumnical turnout of religious leaders, <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION>, Roman Catholic, Eastern Orthodox and Jewish, are taking part in the service, including Episcopal Presiding Bishop <PERSON> Edmund </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Browning </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` Clap your hands, all people!'' say the Psalms for the affair. `` Shout to God with loud songs of joy! For the Lord, the Most High, is ... a great king over all the earth ... Sing praises to God, sing praises.'' Copies of the liturgy have been sent to pastors of all kinds across the country, and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has written them an open letter, suggesting they hold similar Sunday morning services, afterward ringing church bells. The hourlong service unfolds in three topical sections of concern _ for Americans, for stewardship of the created earth and for world peace and friendship _ each section with Scripture readings, litanies and sermons. In the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> service, <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, wife of Secretary of State-designate <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, leads the litany of concern for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s people, which reads in part: `` Behold, O Father, our land, our <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Bless her always with sound strength and sure purpose,'' with `` vision and courage to nourish and preserve her as a haven of freedom and justice and peace.'' The Rev. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Gomes </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> minister and a black American Baptist, gives the sermon on that theme after Greek Orthodox Archbishop <PERSON> Iakovos </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> reads accompnaying Scripture from <PERSON> James </PERSON> 2, which goes in part: `` Listen, my beloved brethren ... ` you shall love your neighbor as yourself' ... If a brother or sister is ill-clad and in lack of daily food, and one of you says to them, ` Go in peace, be warmed and filled,' without giving them the things they need for the body, what does it profit? `` So faith by itself, if it has no works, is dead.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s son, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, leads the litany on preserving the created order, saying in part: `` Behold, O Lord, your creation, ` this fragile Earth, our island home' ... teach us to know and to respect the delicate balance of your creation, so that our ignorance can be overcome ... thereby restraining our expoitation and abuse of natural resources.'' Missouri's Gov. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashcroft </PERSON>, a layman of the Assemblies of God, preaches on the conservation theme, following Scripture readings about the creation from <ORGANIZATION> Genesis </ORGANIZATION> 1, including this conclusion: `` And God saw that it was good.'' That reading is by the Rev. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smallman </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> McLean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Presbytrerian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> which is attended by Vice Preident <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quale </PERSON> and his family. <PERSON> Browning </PERSON>, the Episcopal primate, preaches on the theme of reconciliation of the Earth's people after a Scripture reading from the beatitudes of <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> in Matthew 5, including: `` Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God.'' <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s Episcopal Bishop <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> presides at the service, punctuated with hymn singing and music from the <ORGANIZATION> U. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Band </ORGANIZATION>, the Cathedral Choir and <ORGANIZATION> Howard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Choir </ORGANIZATION>. After the opening processional and singing, Rabbi <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> of B ` Nai <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> congregation in <LOCATION> Rockville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, reads an initial Scripture passage from <ORGANIZATION> Deuteronomy </ORGANIZATION> 10, going in part: `` For the Lord your God is God of gods and Lord of lords, the great, the mighty, and the terrible God, who is not partial ... He executes justice for the fatherless and the widow, and loves the sojourner, giving him food and clothing.'' <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s Roman Catholic Cardinal <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Hickey </PERSON> reads from 1st <ORGANIZATION> Corinthians </ORGANIZATION> 12, going in part: `` Now there are varieties of gifts, but the same Spirit; and there are varieties of service, but the same Lord; and there are varieties of working, but it is the same God who inspires them all in every one.''

 Those who only know <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Morrell </PERSON>'s work through the <PERSON> Sylvester </PERSON> <PERSON> Stallone </PERSON> `` Rambo'' movies based on his books probably do n't grasp the subtle subtexts. But most of his 13 books, including the best-seller `` Brotherhood of the Rose,'' now an <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> miniseries, revolve around father-son relationships. `` Brotherhood of the Rose,'' a four-hour, two-part miniseries, is scheduled to air Sunday after the Super Bowl and conclude Monday. It stars <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Morse </PERSON> and <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON> as orphans trained by their adoptive father -LRB- <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchum </PERSON> -RRB- to be assassins. But the father eventually betrays them. The original `` Rambo'' was based on <PERSON> Morrell </PERSON>'s 1972 book, `` First Blood,'' about a <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> veteran who turns against the society that slights him. Even Rambo is a surrogate son. His former commander, Col. <PERSON> Trautman </PERSON>, played by <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Crenna </PERSON> in the movies, is the father figure. Though he is known for writing in the action-adventure genre, <PERSON> Morrell </PERSON> has written a book called `` Fireflies'' about the death last year of his 15-year-old son, <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON>. `` I've had more response from that book than anything else I've written,'' he said `` I've heard from people with pain. It's about a child who died and my grief. I was in a state of crisis. I was trying to make sense out of the irrational. `` Fathers and sons have been a major theme of my work. My father was a flier in World War II and was shot down over <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. I never knew him. I grew up with a strong sense of something missing. I write about male bonding between an older man and a younger man. I grew up without a father, and now I must live the rest of my life without a son.'' <PERSON> Morrell </PERSON>'s said the germ of `` Brotherhood of the Rose,'' was a casual remark by an intelligence source who told him the primary recruiting ground for assassins is orphanages. `` I got very interested when I heard that,'' said <PERSON> Morrell </PERSON>. `` I said, ` What an idea for a book!''' The father figure in `` Brotherhood of the Rose,'' he said, `` does n't perceive of himself as a villain. He's with the government but sort of operates in a world of his own. The crux of the story is that these two young men were programmed as assassins. `` But what happens is that at a certain point they discovered he did n't love them, that he had been using them. It turns into a chase as the two students stalk the old pro. It's the sons against the father. It's almost like a Greek tragedy.'' `` Brotherhood of the Rose,'' directed by <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Chomsky </PERSON>, was filmed in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION>.

He said he has no complaint about the `` Rambo'' movies, but does wish the characterizations were n't usually sacrificed in favor of the action. <PERSON> Morrell </PERSON> was a professor at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Iowa </ORGANIZATION> for 16 years until he resigned in 1986 to devote all his time to writing. `` I had full tenure as a professor, but I said I'd done that,'' he said. He decided to remain in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. He said he is lucky `` people buy what I write.

 President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> promised `` new faces'' to help lead his administration but the consummate government insider has turned to people cozy with the ways of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to fill his Cabinet. Even the two women he picked _ <PERSON> Carla </PERSON> <PERSON> Hills </PERSON> as the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade negotiator and <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> as labor secretary _ are long-time fixtures on the capital's power circuit. In fact, only three people in the new Cabinet had not held earlier full-time jobs either in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> or the administration. They are Dr. <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, the head of health and human services; <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON> at commerce, and <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> at transportation. `` I never pledged that I would have a totally inexperienced Cabinet,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` I want an experienced Cabinet. That's exactly what we've got. Three men are hold-over appointments from the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration: Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>, <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> as treasury secretary and <PERSON> Lauro </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cavazos </PERSON> as education secretary.

 Admirers call <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Addison </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, the new secretary of state, the `` ultimate pragmatist.'' At least one skeptic has called him `` Mr. Shmooze.'' The accolade suggests an open and adaptable approach; the criticism, a tendency toward private self-promotion. At the outset, <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s strength lies in strong ties to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. His views will be heard. He can operate free of anxiety that White House officials are scheming to undercut him. His main weakness is lack of experience in foreign affairs. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, 58, managed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s unsuccessful 1980 presidential drive and his victorious campaign last year. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> have been close for nearly two decades. They share a wealthy country-club <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> background. Both are <ORGANIZATION> Ivy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> graduates _ <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> went to <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> to <LOCATION> Princeton </LOCATION>. At State, the main issues confronting <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> are whether to keep U.S.-Soviet relations on a conciliatory course and what to do about the 40-year Arab-Israeli dispute and the problems in Central America. His background as treasury secretary will help him cope with rising debt problems in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. His political skills are bound to maintain the smooth relations with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> allies that <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, his predecessor, cultivated.

He has kept a low profile so far, in part because there have been no economic crises which demanded immediate attention. Once <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> takes office, <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> is expected to play a key role in some of the biggest problems facing the new administration: how to trim the budget deficit, how to resolve the savings and loan crisis and what to do about the $ 1.3 trillion in debt being carried by Third World countries. <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, 58, entered <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> one year after <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> graduated.

During nine terms as a congressman from <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> gained a reputation for his outspoken views on economic policy and his staunch anti-communism. But many people have high expectations that <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> will put the spotlight back on the housing agency, which has been virtually hidden from public view for eight years under <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>.

He built a reputation for toughness as top deputy to <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> when the governor was <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney and created the office's Special Investigation Division, leading the prosecution of former Democratic Gov. <PERSON> Otto </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerner </PERSON>, who was convicted in 1973.

Mrs. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, 52, was a Democrat when she came to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> two decades ago, but switched to an independent and then <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> as she climbed the ladder of success, holding several jobs in the <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> administrations and becoming an active campaigner in the presidential campaigns of her husband, <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Republican leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> chose her as transportation secretary in 1983. She served for four years and left with her popularity intact despite criticism that during her tenure air and highway safety suffered. Organized labor had a few disputes with Mrs. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> while she was at transportation, but labor leaders have voiced approval of her selection, if only for the fact that they believe her political ambitions will lead her to seek a higher profile than those who were passed over for the job. At the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, she will be involved in <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s promised plan to expand day care availability and likely will serve as the administration's chief spokeswoman when <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> debates raising the minumum wage and in a legal fight over the government's plan to drop a ban on home work in the apparel industry. _ By <PERSON> John </PERSON>

<HEAD>Quayle Sees Bush as Model for Vice Presidency</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Special Correspondent</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Imitation may be the sincerest form of vice presidency _ and <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> is modeling his performance on the way <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> handled the job. That bodes well for his job appraisals by the boss. `` He knows what it takes to be an effective vice president,'' the incoming No. 2 man said of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` He was one.'' The vice president-elect said much of his work will be low-visibility, one-on-one advice and assistance to the president. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said he wo n't be speaking up in forums like Cabinet meetings but, rather, will offer his ideas in even more private settings. He is to meet daily with the president during the new administration. There are to be private luncheons each Thursday, like those <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> held with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. The president-elect said he will treat <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> as he was treated during eight years as vice president. `` His vice presidency will be like mine,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said in an interview with The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> already has consulted him on Cabinet appointments, has sought his advice on a variety of issues. He wo n't describe the subjects, let alone the advice. `` That's one of the reasons I'll be an effective vice president,'' he said. `` I'm just not going to take these things public.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> stuck with that rule even when mocked for it during the campaign. Vice presidents do not get starring roles. They are understudies. That assignment poses a special problem for <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. After a campaign of controversy and sometimes ridicule, he has an image to repair. He's said he intends to make life more difficult for the late-night television comics who have been thriving on Quayle jokes. The vice presidency itself often has been a joking matter. In the musical comedy `` Of Thee I Sing,'' <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Throttlebottom </PERSON> got the job by losing a drawing and had to join a tour group to get into the White House. Vice President <PERSON> Alben </PERSON> <PERSON> Barkley </PERSON> told of the two boys who vanished _ one went to sea and the other became vice president. So <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> has a tall order to fill. A second-term <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> senator who vaulted to the Republican ticket at age 41, with no national credentials, he has to demonstrate his ability and his leadership qualifications, all in a supporting role with a relatively low profile. `` The high visibility, the high profile is by the president, not the vice president,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said. `` But the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people will judge me on how I perform.'' He said there will be public assignments, tasks that will put his abilities out front so that the people can determine what kind of job he's doing. The most telling judgment will come from one man, the 41st president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` ... I will be a broad-ranging adviser to the president,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said, working on `` the model that was established by <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>.'' He said much of what <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> did for <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was known only to them. He said he intends to work the same way, and to judge his performance by its usefulness to the president. `` If he continues to have confidence in you, to rely on you for things of importance, then you are an effective vice president,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said. He said his specific assignments will evolve as events dictate, and will include foreign and domestic travel, political missions, work with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and more. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in an earlier AP interview that a lack of specific and immediate vice presidential assignments wo n't be a problem. `` <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> did n't give me anything to do,'' he said. `` It just evolved.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the same pattern will apply in his relationship with his own vice president. `` And then I'll say to him some day, ` <PERSON> Dan </PERSON>, I've got a real problem here and I want you to handle it. And you're the guy to do it because you've got a standing beyond any of these Cabinet members.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he'd reminded <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> a while back that he'd had his own image problems not long before. `` I said, ` <PERSON> Dan </PERSON>, take an eraser and erase <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> from these stories, take an eraser to the date and set the date back a year, and then where you're taken out <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> put in <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and you'll be pretty close ... `` So things turn around.''

<HEAD>Civilian Authority in Guatemala Still Subject to Military Consent</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DOUGLAS GRANT MINE</BYLINE>
<HEAD>Associated Press Writer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GUATEMALA CITY (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 This tiny country of 8.5 million people _ more than half of them Indians who speak two dozen Mayan dialects _ has never sustained a modern democratic government. Today, three years after it elected a civilian as president, it still is trying to shake off its past. Civilian authority, it is widely agreed, is conditioned on military consent and supervision. `` I assumed the presidency to begin a new attempt to establish constitutional democracy in our country,'' President <PERSON> Vinicio </PERSON> <PERSON> Cerezo </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Jan. 14, the anniversary of his inauguration. `` We can say we have achieved some of our goals. We are in better shape than before.'' `` <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> is living through a transition government,'' the defense minister, Gen. <PERSON> Hector </PERSON> <PERSON> Gramajo </PERSON>, said in an interview. `` We will have a new <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> by the year 2000.'' Under the generals of the early 1980s, <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> was an international pariah. In an effort to wipe out a stubborn leftist insurgency, human rights groups said, the armed forces and military-linked death squads killed tens of thousands of suspected government opponents _ accusations the armed forces deny. Would-be organizers of left-leaning labor unions were slain. The press was tightly muzzled. Above-ground political activity by any organization to the left of center was nil. The economy was stagnant. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, then under President <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, cut off <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid. Non-military aid resumed under the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, but a decision to let <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> buy almost $ 14 million worth of M-16 rifles last year drew fire from congressional critics in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Today, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> calls <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> an `` emerging democracy,'' a classification that remains controversial. Expression is much freer nowadays, though still subject to some unwritten restraints. A leftist-led labor federation has grown impressively. Politicians who describe themselves as socialists speak out and survive. Thousands of Indians driven into the hills or across the northern border into <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> by harsh military campaigns are beginning to return. The insurgency sputters along, but at a much lower level; the 1,500 or so guerrilla fighters hold no territory. Economic growth in 1988 was a robust 3.5 percent, with officials predicting even greater expansion this year. But the progress was made under a watchful military eye that limits the authority of <ORGANIZATION> Cerezo </ORGANIZATION>, the legislature and the judiciary. A coup attempt May 11, reportedly sponsored by extreme rightist businessmen and landowners, was put down without bloodshed when <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Minister <PERSON> Gramajo </PERSON> backed the government. `` The military is disposed to stop being part of the problem,'' <PERSON> Gramajo </PERSON> said in the interview. `` It rather will be part of the solution. Military power is exercised in military matters, and in the broader sense, we serve the function of stabilizers.'' Still, the attempted rebellion made clear the degree to which <ORGANIZATION> Cerezo </ORGANIZATION>'s continued occupation of the presidential palace depended on military consent. Diplomats and other observers said he was obliged to agree to several rebel demands backed by even those officers opposed to a coup. Among them were a halt to tentative efforts to separate police forces from military command. `` May 11 put an end to any illusion of real power he might have thought he had,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Giron </PERSON>, a Roman Catholic priest and peasant organizer. <PERSON> Giron </PERSON>, a longtime friend of <ORGANIZATION> Cerezo </ORGANIZATION>'s, said he probably will ask for a dispensation from the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> to run for president in 1990. `` Here you can be the government, but you ca n't govern, because you've got thousands of guns pointed at your back,'' said a provincial mayor and member of <ORGANIZATION> Cerezo </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, commenting only on condition of anonymity. Land reform is one area of concern. Peasant organizations estimate 70 percent of the country's arable land is owned by 1 percent of the population. Other groups dispute that figure, but acknowledge that land distribution is greatly skewed in favor of a tiny upper class. Members of the diplomatic corps said <ORGANIZATION> Cerezo </ORGANIZATION> would not be allowed to establish diplomatic relations with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, although foreign relations generally are an executive branch prerogative in Western democracies. `` This government does n't have the characteristics of what you would call a democracy,'' said a government official involved in investigation of human rights abuses. Most diplomats agree that <ORGANIZATION> Cerezo </ORGANIZATION> has proven adept at walking a fine line, that he is a pragmatic master of compromise. With the right divided and the left emerging from decades of repression, the centrist <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> appear in good shape to retain the presidency when <ORGANIZATION> Cerezo </ORGANIZATION>, who can not succeed himself, leaves office office in 1991. <ORGANIZATION> Cerezo </ORGANIZATION> appears intent on ingratiationg himself with the military until then. When 22 peasants were massacred last November in <LOCATION> Chimaltenango </LOCATION> province, he immediately accepted the military version of events that put blame on leftist guerrillas. He did so despite what his own government's human rights attorney, <PERSON> Gonzalo </PERSON> <PERSON> Menendez </PERSON>, described as a lack of evidence implicating any particular individuals or organizations. On New Years' Day, 83 people drowned when a crowded ferry capsized while being towed by a navy patrol vessel. Survivors, including a tugboat captain, said a recklessly executed tow was the disasters' principal cause, but <ORGANIZATION> Cerezo </ORGANIZATION>, for whom defense of the military has become a reflex, praised the navy's rescue efforts `` If the navy had not been there, the tragedy would have been worse,'' he said before leaving Jan. 3 for a 10-day trip to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. His office described the trip as a `` personal vacation,'' and he stayed on vacation even as argument swirled over whether <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> presidents should hold a summit conference Jan. 15-16. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Alfonso </PERSON> <PERSON> Cabrera </PERSON>, looking for a success to bolster his prospective presidential campaign, pushed the summit, designed to restart the Central American peace process and finally end guerrilla wars in the region. <PERSON> Cabrera </PERSON> was unsuccessful and the summit was postponed; <ORGANIZATION> Cerezo </ORGANIZATION> made no public statement and took no visible part in the debate, which was over before he returned to <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>.

 It was 15 months ago when seven <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Linen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supply </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> workers walked off the job, a strike that the plant's other 35 union members did n't honor. The strikers, all women, were replaced on the strike's first day and they have long since been cut from unemployment compensation rolls. They have n't given up. Their stubborness has become a saga in this northern <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> town and a nationwide symbol of labor-management confrontation in an era when job security has become a prevailing issue. `` We eat, drink, and sleep the strike,'' said <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Judnitsch </PERSON>, 48. `` You just ca n't help it.'' <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Pender </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Iron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Range </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, said the women's persistence has astonished observers. `` It was amazing that they were standing out there last winter when it was 30 below,'' <PERSON> Pender </PERSON> said. `` Well, here it is this winter and they're still there.'' Known as the <ORGANIZATION> Hibbing </ORGANIZATION> 7, they take turns picketing outside the green and white plant where they used to wash, mend and press linen for $ 5.42 an hour. They walked off the job Oct. 2, 1987, after 11 of 17 members of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commercial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> Local 1116 voted to strike rather than accept management's final contract offer. They had been working without a contract for 11 months. <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Carpenter </PERSON>, 43, said the four other workers who voted to strike immediately capitulated when it became apparent they faced dismissal. The strikers objected to a contract provision that eliminated company contributions to the union pension fund, <PERSON> Carpenter </PERSON> said. Instead, the company offered to put money into individual retirement accounts for workers, she said. The women also said they believe <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Pajunen </PERSON>, company president, was out to destroy the union. They cite a letter found by strikers in the company's trash. The letter, from lawyer <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Harding </PERSON> of <PERSON> Lincoln </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Neb. </LOCATION>, previewed a meeting at which district executives would be briefed on `` negotiations in the <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hibbing </LOCATION> district which led to non-union status at various locations.'' <PERSON> Pajunen </PERSON> said the letter does not reflect an anti-union bias. He says the plant has operated more smoothly without a union, but adds he did not intend to break it. `` I'm not anti-labor, but they do a lot of intimidating,'' <PERSON> Pajunen </PERSON> said of unions. `` Some of the things they stand for are n't necessarily always right. <PERSON> Pender </PERSON> said the strikers would have lost interest if it were n't for favorable rulings by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>'s regional office in <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> and a federal administrative law judge in Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Leiner </PERSON> in September upheld allegations of wrongdoing made by the <ORGANIZATION> NRLB </ORGANIZATION>'s regional office. He ordered <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Linen </ORGANIZATION> to reinstate the seven workers with back pay and full seniority rights. A company appeal is pending. By firing <PERSON> Carpenter </PERSON>, <PERSON> Judnitsch </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Suzick </PERSON>, 61, <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, 52, <PERSON> Roberta </PERSON> <PERSON> Hecimovich </PERSON>, 46; <PERSON> Marge </PERSON> <PERSON> Richards </PERSON>, 51, and <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Perry </PERSON>, 33, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Linen </ORGANIZATION> unlawfully discriminated against employees engaged in a lawful union activity, <PERSON> Leiner </PERSON> wrote. The judge also said American Linen must recognize Local 1116 as bargaining agent for the <LOCATION> Hibbing </LOCATION> workers. A petition to decertify the union signed by a majority of plant workers four days after the strike began should be dismissed because the company illegally helped prepare and file it, the judge ruled. `` We've won. We're right,'' <PERSON> Judnitsch </PERSON> said. `` If we did n't feel that we were right we would n't be out there.'' <PERSON> Pajunen </PERSON> said he never fired the strikers. `` They walked off their jobs,'' he said. `` At this point not one has asked to come back.'' The company president said he would consider rehiring the strikers if any of the 70 positions open. Meanwhile, he said, he would fight any ruling from the <ORGANIZATION> NLRB </ORGANIZATION> that is `` untrue.'' <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Watters </PERSON>, an attorney for Local 1116, said appeals could prolong the fight another year or two. He said the women are willing to battle until they win, bolstered by strong financial support from the union. `` Fortunately it's not too many situations that end up like this,'' <PERSON> Watters </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said she and her husband have been limited to her weekly $ 40 strike benefits and his monthly wage of about $ 700 since the strike began. `` You go from burning fuel oil to burning wood,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, who has been living without any health insurance coverage since losing her job. `` You just cut corners. Sometimes it's just enough heat to keep the pipes from freezing.'' <PERSON> Pajunen </PERSON> said the strikers are `` misguided.'' `` There's probably one or two people in that group who get their kicks from doing something like this and the other people got trapped,'' he said. Not all the strikers knew each other before the walkout and now they frequently socialize after handling picket duty. `` I think we have our down days,'' <PERSON> Judnitsch </PERSON> said. `` But we're pretty hearty We're determined.'' The inevitable lows have been offset by a few highs, <PERSON> Suzick </PERSON> said. For instance, <PERSON> Crystal </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Sutton </PERSON>, whose successful union struggle against a southern textile manufacturer was depicted in the movie `` <PERSON> Norma </PERSON> <PERSON> Rae </PERSON>,'' appeared at a June 25th rally on their behalf. The Rev. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> invited them on stage during a campaign appearance. In addition, the strikers say they've scored partial success in promoting a regional boycott of American Linen's service. A local school district, for example, has stopped taking the service, <PERSON> Judnitsch </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Pajunen </PERSON> said the boycott has not reduced business. `` We have a plant full of happy employees producing for our customers,'' he said. `` We're not hurting.''

 The oil markets have maintained upward momentum, fueled by buying amid speculation about possibly tighter supplies in the future. In recent days, crude oil futures prices have soared to a 14-month high. The February contract for <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intermediate </ORGANIZATION>, the benchmark grade of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude oil, settled Tuesday at $ 18.95 a barrel on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, up 7 cents a barrel on the day. The last time the contract for the nearby month settled higher was Nov. 5, 1987 when the price at the end of the trading day reached $ 18.98 a barrel. At that time, there were concerns that the Iran-Iraq war could seriously disrupt shipments of crude from the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. The price of the near-month contract for <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intermediate </ORGANIZATION> now stands sharply higher than last autumn. On Oct. 5, the nearby contract sank to an intraday low of $ 12.28 a barrel. Analysts say the markets lately have derived support from a series of factors deemed promising for the price outlook, particularly speculation that <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> nations would be able to curb their crude oil production. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Fiedler </PERSON>, a vice president at <ORGANIZATION> E.D. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> F. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Man </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said market operators are not necessarily confident that an output accord will come out of a meeting beginning Jan. 26 in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> between members of the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION> and non-OPEC countries. But, they do not expect the meeting to produce any negative news for the oil markets either, he said. The nearby West Texas Intermediate contract reached a high of $ 19.21 during the session before traders began to sell to collect profits amassed during the recent advance. Gasoline contracts in the more distant months benefited from buying partly based on thinking that new environmental specifications due to take effect this year could restrict availability in the future. Buying in gasoline spilled over into the crude oil contracts, brokers said. The February contract for unleaded gasoline rose 0.19 cent to settle at 51.10 cents a gallon. Among other refined products traded on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the February contract for No. 2 heating oil slipped 0.11 cent to 53.05 cents a gallon.

 <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the entertainment, publishing and financial services giant, plans to buy a stake in a company that owns television stations in several major markets. <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Western said Tuesday its <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> had agreed in principle to a deal that would give it an option to buy a majority interest in <ORGANIZATION> TVX </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which owns nine independent television stations. It would buy the stake from an affiliate of <ORGANIZATION> Salomon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the securities firm that helped <ORGANIZATION> TVX </ORGANIZATION> finance its purchase of five television stations in April 1987. No price was disclosed for the latest deal, and it is subject to reaching a definitive agreement as well as regulatory approval. But analysts said it apparently would give <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Western a relatively inexpensive entry into broadcast television. In trading on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Western fell 62 -LCB- cents a share to $ 41.

Its parent has said it wanted to become involved in TV station ownership but that high prices discouraged it. <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Western would join a growing list of companies involved in TV programming that have bought television stations. Such companies feel that by getting involved in `` the retail end of distribution,'' they can exert more control over where and when their programs are aired, said <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Katz </PERSON>, media analyst for the securities firm <ORGANIZATION> Mabon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nugent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Western said <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> had agreed in principle to acquire the right to buy <PERSON> Salomon </PERSON>'s majority investment in <ORGANIZATION> TVX </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcast </ORGANIZATION>, which is based in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Salomon </PERSON> wound up with preferred and common stock representing a 79 percent equity interest in <ORGANIZATION> TVX </ORGANIZATION> following the television company's As the first step in the deal, <PERSON> Salomon </PERSON> would put all of its TVX common stock and enough of its TVX preferred in a new joint venture that would represent about 51 percent of <ORGANIZATION> TVX </ORGANIZATION>'s voting common shares. Paramount would buy a 49 percent interest in the joint venture, and get an option to buy <PERSON> Salomon </PERSON>'s stake in the venture and the rest of <ORGANIZATION> Salomon </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> TVX </ORGANIZATION> preferred stock. The statement did not say how much <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> would pay for its initial stake in the venture, but one source familiar with the deal and speaking on condition that he not be identified said it was about $ 10 million. The source said the total cost to <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION>, should it acquire all of <PERSON> Salomon </PERSON>'s stake, would be between $ 125 million and $ 180 million, depending on the company's future performance. <PERSON> Salomon </PERSON> became involved with TVX Broadcast when it provided temporary financing for the concern to acquire five television stations in April 1987. Before TVX Broadcast could line up permanent financing, the stock market crashed in October 1987 and drove up potential costs of borrowing.

<HEAD>Icahn Raises Stake In Texaco; Readies For Proxy Fight</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Investor <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> has accused <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> management of deceiving shareholders by formulating a new anti-takeover defense after promising that an existing strategy would be allowed to expire. In a filing with the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> Tuesday, <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> also disclosed that he has raised his stake in the oil giant to 16.6 percent, and that he is considering another proxy challenge for control of the company. `` You know full well that a changed -LRB- ` poison -RRB- pill' would have a chilling effect on my ability _ or anyone else's _ ability to make an offer to <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> shareholders,'' <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> said in a letter to <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kinnear </PERSON>. <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> said a new effort by management to block bids for the company would in effect deprive shareholders ot `` what could be a premium of billions of dollars for their shares.'' Last June, <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> lost a bitter struggle against management for control of <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>'s board. Prior to that, <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>'s board had rejected <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>'s friendly $ 60-a-share offer to buy the company. Tuesday's <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> filing came in response to an article in the Wall Street Journal. The newspaper reported <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> was preparing to replace its expiring poison-pill takeover defense with a new plan. <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> had assured shareholders during its proxy battle against <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> that it would eliminate the poison pill, which is aimed at making a hostile takeover prohibitively expensive. Analysts have said that promise was largely responsible for <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>'s victory in the proxy fight. <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> then promised the committee representing its shareholders in the company's then-ongoing Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization that it would not issue another poison pill without the approval of shareholders or authorization from an investment banking firm designated by the committee. In composite trading on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> Tuesday, <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> stock rose 50 cents to close at $ 53.50 a share. The newspaper also reported that the shareholders committee had designated the investment banker <ORGANIZATION> Rothschild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> to issue a new defense and that <PERSON> Kinnear </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> DeCrane </PERSON> had visited <PERSON> Rothschild </PERSON>'s offices about a successor to the poison pill. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Dea </PERSON>, counsel for the equity committee, denied the panel had made any such designation. <PERSON> Kinnear </PERSON> issued a statement late Tuesday saying, `` This is another case of <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> protesting without knowing what is being proposed and making claims solely for his own benefit.'' <PERSON> Kinnear </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> is considering an interim plan to take effect when the existing pill expires in April. That plan would be in effect until shareholders have the opportunity to vote on it at <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>'s annual meeting in May. <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> officials said the plan would not preclude any legitimate offers for the company but `` would avoid anyone's acquiring control of <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> through creeping purchases, to the detriment of other <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> shareholders.'' <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>'s biggest shareholder, said in a filing with the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> that he boosted his stake in <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> to 16.6 percent from 16.2 percent. <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> declined to specify his intentions or to say whether a second proxy fight was likely. However, in the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> filing <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> said he and other investors were considering forming a slate of nominees to the four <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> board seats up for election at the annual meeting. Whether he launches a proxy battle depends on the `` nature of <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>'s recent restructuring,'' <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> emerged from bankruptcy last April and is undergoing a major restructuring to raise $ 5 billion in cash, mainly through asset sales. <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> promised to distribute $ 1.7 billion in proceeds to shareholders probably through a stock buyback early this year. In his letter to <PERSON> Kinnear </PERSON>, <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> alluded to the possibility of making another fight for <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> if the company fails to `` sufficiently benefit shareholders in a restructuring that takes into account the higher proceeds now expected to be received from the sale of <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canada </ORGANIZATION>.'' <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>'s sale of its 78 percent stake in the profitable Canadian subsidiary is one of the final steps in the restructuring it undertook to emerge from Chapter 11. Company observers were divided over <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>'s latest gestures. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Aydin </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> McDonald </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> deserves better treatment because he is largely responsible for the rise in <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> stock from $ 45 a year ago. Other analysts said they were skeptical about <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>'s intentions since <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> could benefit handsomely if he decides to sell his shares back to <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>. `` It is in his best interests to pressure <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> so they could offer him the sweetest deal possible,'' said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuklinski </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Cowen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` He has the opportunity to get out of his stock if <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> chooses to accommodate him in some fashion and he is reminding them that might be in their best interest to do so,'' he said.

Forget about having to wait in long lines as others decide on their choice of salads or desserts and then having to balance heavy trays as you look for a seat. <ORGANIZATION> Luby </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cafeterias </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, known for its assortment of salads, mounds of meats and delightful desserts, is giving customers another choice: eat inside or use a new, drive-through service at its newest, biggest cafeteria. `` We think we have a market and we want to capitalize on it,'' said <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> `` Bud'' <PERSON> Schrader </PERSON>, vice president of marketing for the San Antonio-based cafeteria chain. `` Obviously the fast-food people have developed the take-home food market, but the foods are essentially limited to <LOCATION> Mexican </LOCATION> food, hamburgers, fried chicken and pizza,'' he said. `` I think we have what we can attest can be a success because a lot of people like our menu and a better-balanced meal, and we just know that as the market continues to develop more and more people will be taking us home with them to sit and watch TV or something on their VCR,'' <PERSON> Schrader </PERSON> said. The new drive-through cafeteria will open on Feb. 13 just north of downtown <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>. It will have about 16,000 square feet of space, including the area that will accommodate the `` To Go'' and `` Park and Order'' areas. Most Luby's have about 10,500 square feet of space. The drive-through service is not quite like ordering a <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mac </ORGANIZATION>, a Whopper or a two-piece chicken dinner. Those wishing to place `` To Go'' orders at <ORGANIZATION> Luby </ORGANIZATION>'s can either call in and then walk through a separate entrance to the cafeteria to pick up their order. Or, they can either call in or go to six parking spaces that will have laminated menus and intercoms to place the order. After placing the order, the cafeteria workers will prepare the order and tell the customer to drive to the window and pick up the order. The kinks will have to be worked out after the first few days, but <PERSON> Schrader </PERSON> believes cafeteria customers will not have to wait much longer than they would at other fast-food places. `` This is just an expansion of giving the customer another convenience,'' he said. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Doyle </PERSON>, an analyst who follows <ORGANIZATION> Luby </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Upham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said convenience is great, but it's not all the customer is looking for. `` I think the time has probably come for people in the cafeteria business to try this,'' he said. `` It probably has been a logistical challenge because of the diversity of the menu. I'd be interested in looking on how they package their food,'' he said. `` Obviously, it has to be convenient and easy to handle, but you do n't want your potatoes and gravy spilling into your corn,'' <PERSON> Doyle </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Schrader </PERSON> said <PERSON> Luby </PERSON>'s will use different packages, depending on which items the customer orders. `` When we can, we combine food, but if there is any possibility of spillage, the food is individualized,'' he said. `` We have some three-compartment plates, but in some cases when you ca n't put spinach in there, then it will be individualized.'' <PERSON> Luby </PERSON>'s, founded in 1947 by two restaurateurs, now has 118 cafeterias in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>. In its last fiscal year ending in August, it posted sales of $ 254 million. For years, <PERSON> Luby </PERSON>'s customers were able to take home food from the cafeteria, but <ORGANIZATION> Luby </ORGANIZATION>'s never marketed its `` To Go'' business until late 1987. In September of that year at its cafeteria near the <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Luby </PERSON>'s put up a separate `` To Go'' entrance in the cafeteria to test customers' desires. Last January, <PERSON> Luby </PERSON>'s kicked off its `` To Go'' marketing program with printed menus and on-premises promotions. The drive-through cafeteria is a test project for <ORGANIZATION> Luby </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Schrader </PERSON> said he does n't know if it will be expanded to other cafeterias. The separate `` To Go'' entrances may be expanded to include other stores, <PERSON> Schrader </PERSON> said. He believes, however, that other cafeteria chains like <PERSON> Furr </PERSON>'s and <PERSON> Wyatt </PERSON>'s will begin drive-throughs soon. Officials from those cafeteria companies did not return telephone calls to The Associated Press. `` Our competitors will follow us and some are in the process of doing it right now,'' <PERSON> Schrader </PERSON> said. `` This is just an expanding market and all good businesses have to capitalize on it. `` This requires more labor, no question about it, but all of this is return on our investment and we feel good about it,'' <PERSON> Schrader </PERSON> said. Bon Appetit.

<HEAD>American Airlines Said To Mull Aircraft Orders Worth $7.4 Billion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FORT WORTH, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> is expected to announce two aircraft orders for 160 <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> airplanes worth a total $ 7.4 billion, according to a published report. The <ORGANIZATION> Fort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Worth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Star-Telegram </ORGANIZATION> reported in Tuesday's editions that the deal would have to be approved by the board of directors of <ORGANIZATION> AMR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> American </LOCATION>'s parent. The board's monthly meeting is scheduled for today. But American spokesman <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Becker </PERSON> described the report as `` highly speculative.'' The newspaper said the airline, owner of the largest commercial jet fleet in the non-communist world, will order 60 long-range <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> MD-11s for an estimated $ 5.4 billion and 100 domestic-range MD-80s for an estimated $ 2 billion more. American decided to buy the MD-11, which has yet to make its first flight, instead of the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747-400, the newest, largest and longest-range of <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commercial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airplane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s line of jumbo jets, the newspaper quoted Wall Street and industry sources as saying. The Star-Telegram said the deals will be announced within the next three weeks, as soon as final language of the contract is worked out. <PERSON> Becker </PERSON>, asked to comment on the report, said: `` We have not signed any agreements nor have we made any deals with either of the aircraft manufacturers and we have no announcements imminent.'' `` The article is highly speculative,'' <PERSON> Becker </PERSON> said when reached by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> at American's headquarters in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>. But <PERSON> Becker </PERSON> noted that American has been evaluating both the MD-11 and the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747-400 as part of its preparation for expansion in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> and European air markets. The airline has 465 jets in its fleet. <ORGANIZATION> Aeroflot </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s state-owned carrier, has the world's largest fleet. American also has an additional 213 planes either on order or option. <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> head offices in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, referred the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION>'s calls about the possible MD-11 and MD-80 purchases to <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON>, the company's spokesman in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. A secretary in <PERSON> Hanson </PERSON>'s office said he was not immediately available Tuesday. To <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's No. 2 commercial jetliner maker, <LOCATION> American </LOCATION>'s acquisition would represent an isolated win in its competition against the larger, wealthier <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>. It would virtually assure more sales, said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Turk </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Avmark </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, firm that consults with airlines on aircraft acquisitions. <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION>, as 1988 ended, had orders, options and other commitments for as many as 250 MD-11s. But until <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> announced in September its order for 40, <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> had down payments in hand for only 40. <PERSON> Turk </PERSON> said one reward for being a so-called launch customer for a new type of aircraft is a discount as high as 30 percent off the plane's list price. `` The MD-11 has been sold for $ 100 million to $ 110 million in ones and twos,'' <PERSON> Turk </PERSON> said. `` We're estimating that <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> is paying right at about $ 90 million per plane for its batch. And American, with its reputation for getting the best price anyone can get, probably will be paying about $ 90 million per copy, too,'' he told the Star-Telegram.

<HEAD>Tokyo Stocks Hit Record High Again, Dollar Up</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>'s leading index hit another record high today, while the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar gained against the Japanese yen for the third consecutive day. The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which fell 70.86 points on Tuesday, climbed 127.03 points, or 0.41 percent, in today's trading, closing at 31,354.55. The previous record of 31,298.38 was set last Friday. Although early trading was directionless, news reports about the possibility of a redenomination of the yen boosted buying orders, dealers said. Such a change could mean, for example, that 100 yen now would become one yen, requiring a reprinting of Japanese money. `` Participants were targeting their buying orders to redenomination-related issues such as paper, pulp and ink,'' said an analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Nomura </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>, speaking on condition of anonymity. The buying interest helped boost volume on the first section to an estimated 1.2 billion shares. The news reports quoted <PERSON> Shintaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Abe </PERSON>, general secretary of the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, as saying Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> was considering a redenomination of the yen. Other dealers said the majority of institutional investors stayed on the sidelines to await the announcement of monthly <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade figures, expected later today in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. On the currency market, the dollar closed at 127.90 yen, up 0.20 yen from Tuesday's 127.70-yen close. The currency also opened today at 127.70 yen and ranged between 127.63 yen and 128.00 yen. The dollar now has gained 1.78 yen in three days. Trading was thin ahead of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade figure announcement, a dealer at <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> said. The market was expecting a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit of $ 11 billion, said the dealer, speaking on condition of anonymity. `` If the deficit increases, it wo n't be a strong dollar-selling force because nobody expected the figure to improve dramatically in the first place,'' he added.

<HEAD>Geldermann Elected CME Chairman</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Geldermann </PERSON> was elected to a one-year term as chairman of the board of governors of the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, defeating <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenberg </PERSON>, another longtime board member. Both men served terms as chairmen of the <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's second-largest futures market, during the 1970s. <ORGANIZATION> Geldermann </ORGANIZATION> was one of five officials elected Tuesday by the exchange's 12 board members, who were themselves elected last week. The exchange did not reveal the vote totals. <ORGANIZATION> Geldermann </ORGANIZATION>, 63, has been a member of the exchange since 1961 and has served in numerous roles on the board and exchange committees. He succeeds <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sandner </PERSON>, who was appointed to the newly created post of senior policy adviser for a 1-year term. <PERSON> Sandner </PERSON> has completed three years as chairman, the maximum allowed under the exchange's rules. The board also reappointed <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> Melamed </PERSON> as chairman of the executive committee and special counsel to the board of governors. <PERSON> Melamed </PERSON> was instrumental in the development of financial futures products in 1972. <PERSON> Rosenberg </PERSON> will remain the board's legislative liaison for the coming year. <ORGANIZATION> Geldermann </ORGANIZATION> co-founded, along with his father, <PERSON> Godfrey </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Geldermann </PERSON>, the Chicago-based trading firm that is now <ORGANIZATION> Geldermann </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a wholly owned subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> ConAgra </ORGANIZATION>, an <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Neb. </LOCATION>, - based conglomerate with interests in food, fertilizer and clothing <ORGANIZATION> Geldermann </ORGANIZATION> was seen as a candidate who would maintain the status quo at the exchange while <PERSON> Rosenberg </PERSON> was said to be a reformer who would try to open up the exchange management beyond a small group of executives who dominate it. As chairman, <ORGANIZATION> Geldermann </ORGANIZATION> may oversee the implementation of the revolutionary <ORGANIZATION> Globex </ORGANIZATION> electronic trading network, a joint project of the <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> and London-based <ORGANIZATION> Reuters </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> that is awaiting regulatory approval. `` Our membership is committed to excellence and innovation,'' <ORGANIZATION> Geldermann </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement. `` My task as the new chairman will be to work with the <ORGANIZATION> CME </ORGANIZATION> leadership team and the board of governors to ensure that this steady progress continues.'' The board also elected <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wollack </PERSON>, first vice chairman; <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Oliff </PERSON>, second vice chairman; <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON>, secretary; and <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON>, treasurer. At the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>, incumbent chairman <PERSON> Karsten </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahlmann </PERSON> was unopposed in winning a third consecutive term Tuesday.

<HEAD>Editor, AMA, Reject Reynolds Complaints about Smokeless Cigs Fight</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 According to its editor, there is no truth to contentions that the Journal of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> is being used in a campaign against the <ORGANIZATION> R.J. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s new `` smokeless'' cigarette. <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> contends the Jan. 6 issue of the weekly publication contained incorrect information about its new cigarette, Premier, which heats rather than burns tobacco. At issue Tuesday was a letter to the editor of JAMA that reported preliminary results from scientists at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Abuse </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>, saying Premier could be altered for use in smoking the potent `` crack'' form of cocaine. <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Di </PERSON> <PERSON> Marco </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> vice president, blasted the report as a `` backdoor'' effort to discredit <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON>' product with `` sensational headlines.'' The journal's editor, Dr. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lundberg </PERSON>, said the letter was published after peer review, because editors believed it to be `` scientifically sound, in the public interest, and timely.'' `` I find it odd and surprising that the <ORGANIZATION> R.J. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> spokesmen would choose to vent their obvious frustration in such a pointless way,'' <PERSON> Lundberg </PERSON> said. `` The Journal of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> has traditionally been editorially independent and remains so at this time,'' <PERSON> Lundberg </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Di </PERSON> <PERSON> Marco </PERSON>, however, accused JAMA of `` promoting distortions to further the political goals of its parent organization.'' The <ORGANIZATION> AMA </ORGANIZATION> contends Premier is a `` new, hazardous'' drug that should be regulated by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, but its petitions to state courts for removal of Premier from test markets in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> have been unsuccessful. Premier contains a metal cylinder with a charcoal tip that is lit by the smoker, who then draws heated air over tobacco products. The Baltimore researchers said the capsule could be removed from the device and its contents emptied out and replaced with crack. The altered Premier then was smoked by a machine in tests that indicated the drug's effects would be felt, they said. It would be `` impossible for a human being to smoke the cigarette in the manner described,'' <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> responded. `` It's outrageous that government scientists are using taxpayers' money to try to devise and report new ways for drug abusers to administer illicit substances,'' Di <PERSON> Marco </PERSON> added The researchers, though, noted <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON>' own patent application said the device `` may be used or modified for use as a drug delivery vehicle, for delivery of volatile pharmaceuticals'' such as those used in inhalers. `` When you patent an invention you patent every single application that product might have,'' <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> spokeswoman <PERSON> Betsy </PERSON> <PERSON> Annese </PERSON> said later Tuesday. `` We have not heard yet of the <ORGANIZATION> AMA </ORGANIZATION> calling for the removal of spoons from the marketplace,'' nor for removal of crack pipes or apples, which she said also can be used for illicit drug use. `` Our question is, ` Why are they picking on this product?''' Ms. <PERSON> Annese </PERSON> said she did not think Premier in its marketed form could be used for taking prescribed or illicit drugs. <PERSON> Di </PERSON> <PERSON> Marco </PERSON> was not taking calls Tuesday. Dr. <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwarz </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> AMA </ORGANIZATION>, who announced in November the association was moving to block test sales of Premier, also rejected <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON>' contention that <ORGANIZATION> JAMA </ORGANIZATION> was being used in the fight to ban Premier. `` We do n't have to manipulate it _ we know what the outcome will be -LRB- of research on the product -RRB-,'' <PERSON> Schwarz </PERSON> said. `` We're opposed to tobacco ... Of course we're opposed to Premier,'' he said. `` We're the first ones to say there's no quarter on this one.'' <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> says Premier has the tar and nicotine levels of a `` lights'' brand and virtually eliminates sidestream smoke and tobacco aroma. `` This leads any unsuspecting person to conclude it must be safer,'' <PERSON> Schwarz </PERSON> said. `` In point of fact, there's no evidence that it's safer.''

<TEXT>
 Share prices rose strongly at midday Wednesday, pushed up by bullish sentiment as the market surpassed last June's post-crash high Late morning news that the British government's December budget surplus was larger than market predictions extended the morning rally, dealers said. By about 12:30 p.m., the <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times-Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> 100-share index was up 19.5 points, or 1 percent, at 1,887.2, just two points below the day's best level of 1,889.2. The index registered its minimum of 1,871.7 at the outset of official trading at 9 a.m. The June post-crash high was 1,879.3. Volume was 301.6 million shares compared with 250.6 million shares at the same time Tuesday. The market's rise also was attributed to market makers being short of stock, dealers said. `` We're short of just about everything,'' one market maker said, `` and whatever comes on the market is being snapped up in the blink of an eye.'' However, dealers detected a slowing in trading early in the afternoon as players grew cautious ahead of the 1:30 p.m. release of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade report for November. `` As long as -LRB- the trade figures -RRB- are n't a disaster, we're locked into an upward path,'' one analyst contended.

 A huge jump in imports helped widen the nation's trade deficit to $ 12.5 billion in November, the largest imbalance in five months, the government reported today. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the gap between what the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> imports and what it sells overseas was about 22 percent higher than the October deficit of $ 10.3 billion. The sharply higher shortfall was blamed on an increase in imports, which shot up to $ 39.7 billion, $ 1.6 billion above the October level. Exports, which have been booming this year, declined by $ 639 million to $ 27.2 billion. The November deficit was the largest since a $ 13.2 billion imbalance in June. Shortly after the report was released the dollar fell in hectic domestic trading while bond prices were narrowly mixed. The financial markets had weakened slightly on Tuesday amid uncertainty over the trade figures, which have frequently moved the markets in the past. In foreign exchange, the dollar's decline came in quiet trading and reflected traders' reluctance to take risky positions before the release of the report in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, analysts said. The consensus is for a trade deficit of about $ 11 billion, compared with $ 10.35 billion in October, but the numbers are renowned for defying predictions. A number sharply higher than $ 11 billion could possibly incite a big selloff in dollars, while a much smaller number could encourage a surge in demand for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency. The dollar's decline also weighed on <LOCATION> Wall </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION>, where the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials finished down 10.00 points to 2,214.64 and broader market indicators also declined. In the bond market, the bellwether 30-year <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bond dipped about $ 1.50 per $ 1,000 in face value. Among commodities, crude oil futures ended higher to extend their recent rally to their highest levels since late 1987. The February contract for <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intermediate </ORGANIZATION>, the benchmark grade of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude, finished 7 cents higher at $ 18.95 a barrel Tuesday on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. It was the highest settlement for a near-month contract since the Nov. 5, 1987 close of $ 18.98 per barrel, and marked a nearly $ 7-a-barrel rise since last autumn. Analysts say the energy markets lately have derived support from speculation that the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries would be able to restrain crude oil output. In other economic news Tuesday, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported 0.4 percent November growth rates in both business inventories and business sales. Analysts said the report is an indicator that the economy is likely to keep growing in 1989. Inventories rose to a seasonally adjusted $ 753.6 billion in November, while sales reached $ 503.8 billion, for matching growth rates of 0.4 percent. When not accompanied by increasing sales, rising inventories can signal economic weakness because they may lead manufacturers to order production cuts and layoffs while they sell reserve goods. The November increase in inventories followed a small rise in October and a 0.9 percent jump in September. It was the 23rd straight month in which inventories had risen, but sales generally have kept pace.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The dollar fell against other major currencies in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> Wednesday after the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government reported that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit widened dramatically to a worse-than-expected $ 12.5 billion in November. The dollar, however, remained mostly higher against other currencies compared with late Tuesday. Gold prices rose in morning trading. The dollar fell after the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported at 1:30 p.m. that the trade gap was 21.9 percent higher than the October deficit of 10.3 billion dollars. Despite the dollar's quick decline, the trade figures were not expected to jolt the financial markets, as poor trade reports have in the past. That's because the foreign exchange markets had been expecting a widening in the deficit, albeit a smaller one, to $ 11.1 billion. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the dollar fell against the British pound. It cost $ 1.7695 to buy one pound after the trade report was released, more than $ 1.7643 before. On Tuesday, it cost $ 1.7680. Here are other dollar rates in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> after the trade report was released, with midmorning rates in parentheses, and compared with late Tuesday's rates: 1.8525 -LRB- 1.8560 -RRB- West German marks, up from 1.8505; 1.5745 -LRB- 1.5808 -RRB- Swiss francs, down from 1.5755; 6.3210 -LRB- 6.3435 -RRB- <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> francs, up from 6.3085; 2.0975 -LRB- 2.0983 -RRB- Dutch guilders, up from 2.0855; 1,361.00 -LRB- 1,363.75 -RRB- Italian lire, up from 1,354.00; 1.1966 -LRB- 1.1975 -RRB- Canadian dollars, down from 1.1973. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where trading ends before <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s business day begins, the dollar rose 0.20 yen to a closing 127.90 yen. Later, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it was quoted at 127.50 yen after the trade report and 127.95 yen before.

<HEAD>Kerkorian Pumps in $180 Million, Outlines Plan for Sale</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GEORGE GARTIES</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
 Financier <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerkorian </PERSON> disclosed he has pumped $ 180 million into <ORGANIZATION> MGM-UA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> as well as developed a series of intricate blueprints for selling part of the struggling movie company he controls. <ORGANIZATION> MGM-UA </ORGANIZATION>, maker of the current box-office hit `` Rain Man'' and TV's `` thirtysomething,'' announced Tuesday that <PERSON> Kerkorian </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Tracinda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> had bought 10 million shares of newly issued preferred stock for $ 18 a share That money, along with $ 85 million raised through new television licensing agreements and sale of receivables, was used to pay off all of the company's revolving credit line. The company also announced it would try to sell the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Artists </ORGANIZATION> part of the conglomerate <PERSON> Kerkorian </PERSON> assembled a decade ago from assets of <ORGANIZATION> UA </ORGANIZATION> and the old <ORGANIZATION> Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer </ORGANIZATION> studios. <ORGANIZATION> UA </ORGANIZATION> will be shopped around by <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Markets </ORGANIZATION>, the former employer of <ORGANIZATION> MGM-UA </ORGANIZATION>'s new chairman and chief executive officer, <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Barbakow </PERSON>. A sale of <ORGANIZATION> MGM-UA </ORGANIZATION> would likely take a form similar to a previous deal that collapsed in July: The entire company would be sold, then the <ORGANIZATION> MGM </ORGANIZATION> studio would be split off, with part being sold back to present shareholders, including <PERSON> Kerkorian </PERSON>. The company has been saying for months that all or part of <ORGANIZATION> MGM-UA </ORGANIZATION> was for sale. <PERSON> Barbakow </PERSON> said various potential byers had expressed interest in the company, but that none had entered negotiations to buy it. A final aspect of the plan announced Tuesday is a rights offering to shareholders other than <PERSON> Kerkorian </PERSON>, who owns more than 80 percent of <ORGANIZATION> MGM-UA </ORGANIZATION> stock. Once the offering is approved by securities regulators, shareholders will be allowed to buy additional shares of the Series A Redeemable Preferred stock <PERSON> Kerkorian </PERSON> bought Tuesday. Analysts found little surprising in the announcement, since both the pending rights offering and potential sale had been discussed previously. The cash infusion from <PERSON> Kerkorian </PERSON>, by strengthening the company's balance sheet, could make <ORGANIZATION> MGM-UA </ORGANIZATION> more attractive to a potential buyer and overcome shareholder reluctance to buy the new preferred stock, said <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Isgur </PERSON>, who follows the company for <ORGANIZATION> PaineWebber </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> The convoluted plan to sell the company and then buy back part of it recalls the failed June deal to split off the other half of the company, <ORGANIZATION> MGM </ORGANIZATION>, and sell a part interest to <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> investor <PERSON> Burt </PERSON> <PERSON> Sugarman </PERSON> and a pair of movie producers. That plan, which would have left <PERSON> Kerkorian </PERSON> holding substantial shares of both <ORGANIZATION> MGM </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> UA </ORGANIZATION>, collapsed two weeks after it was announced. `` Kirk always does something,'' <PERSON> Isgur </PERSON> said of the latest proposal. `` <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerkorian </PERSON> gets bored, he likes to do something.'' The <LOCATION> UA </LOCATION> sale being contemplated would include the movie studio, film and home video rights and <ORGANIZATION> UA </ORGANIZATION>'s 4,000-title film library that includes the `` Rocky,'' <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Bond </PERSON> and `` Pink Panther'' movies, as well as rights to sequels.

<HEAD>Trade Surplus Narrows in 1988, But Was Widening in Recent Months</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s trade surplus shrank in 1988, but was widening in the year's last four months and hit a monthly record in December, the <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> reported today. For all of 1988, the ministry said, the surplus on a customs clearance basis amounted to $ 77.4 billion, down from $ 79.7 billion in 1987. With the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s 1988 surplus was $ 47.6 billion, down from $ 52.1 billion in 1987. The December surplus with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was $ 5.03 billion, up from $ 4.92 billion in the previous December. The overall surplus in December hit a record $ 9.65 billion, up from $ 8.61 billion in the previous December and from $ 6.56 billion in November 1988. It was the fourth consecutive month when <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s surplus exceeded that of the corresponding month in 1987. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s major trading partners have been pressing it for years to take greater steps toward reducing its huge trade surpluses. `` We hear the voices of concern, and we have concern,'' <PERSON> Mitoji </PERSON> <PERSON> Yabunaka </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Second </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Division </ORGANIZATION>, said at a news conference. `` But at the same time, we see encouraging trends.'' In December exports grew 11.6 percent from a year earlier to $ 26.1 billion, while imports grew 11.3 percent to $ 16.4 billion. Lower prices for crude oil, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s most important import commodity, coupled with strong demand overseas for Japanese-made computers, semiconductors and automobiles contributed to the record December figure.

 <ORGANIZATION> Audi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> is recalling about 35,000 1984-1988 5000 Turbo and a small number of 1989 Turbo cars because of a fuel injection system problem that could cause an engine fire. <ORGANIZATION> Audi </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said the company was aware of about a dozen such fires, resulting in no injuries or accidents. The company said Tuesday that high temperature and alcohol in some fuels may harden injector seals, allowing fuel to escape into the engine compartment and causing a fire. <ORGANIZATION> Audi </ORGANIZATION> will notify owners of affected vehicles during the next week. Replacement parts will be available beginning early next month and repairs will be performed free of charge, the automaker said.

 A firm backed by <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s wealthy <PERSON> Pritzker </PERSON> family is working with a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> investment banking firm on a possible bid for <ORGANIZATION> MCorp </ORGANIZATION>, according to industry sources.

 The operating rate at <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> factories, mines and utilities rose in December to the highest rate since November 1979, the government reported today. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> said the use of industrial capacity rose 0.1 percentage points to 84.2 percent last month, the highest rate since 84.3 percent in November 1979. The operating rate for November 1988 was a revised 84.1 percent. As capacity use edges toward 85 percent, economists fear factories will have trouble producing enough goods to meet demand, leading to shortages and price increases. In an accompanying report, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> said industrial production climbed 0.3 percent in December following a revised increase of 0.4 percent in November. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s industrial production index now stands at 140.2 percent of its 1977 base, reflecting sharp gains in auto production and continued strength in production of construction supplies. At manufacturing plants, the operating rate climbed to 84.4 percent last month from 84.3 percent in October. Production of durable goods _ `` big-ticket'' items expected to last at least three years _ rose 0.1 percentage points to 83.0. Production of non-durable goods fell by a like margin to 86.4 percent. Industries with especially strong operating rates over the past two years include primary metals, chemicals, fabricated metal products, non-electrial machinery, autos and automotive parts. Use of motor vehicles and parts manufacturing capacity rose for the fifth straight month to 88.1 percent, up from 85.5 percent in November. The December operating rate at utilities was 81.9 percent, up from 81.3 percent a month earlier. In the mining sector, which includes oil and gas drilling, the operating rate was up 0.1 percentage points to 83.3 percent. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>'s production index has not declined since September 1987, reflecting an export-driven manufacturing boom accompanied by a surge in spending for capital equipment to expand and modernize factories. Production in the manufacturing sector rose 0.3 percent in December following a revised increase at the same rate for the month earlier. Automobiles were assembled at an annual rate of 7.9 million units, up from 7.6 million in November. Production of light trucks also rose sharply. Output at mines was unchanged in December after a 1.4 percent rise a month earlier. Production at utilities was up 0.8 percent from November. Total output at factories, mines and utilities was up 4.7 percent from a year earlier.

<HEAD>Zeroing In On New Breed of Tax-Exempt Bonds</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHET CURRIER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Invest $ 450 now, get $ 1,000 back in the year 2000, and pay no income tax on your earnings! If that's the sort of proposition that appeals to you, you might want to check out an increasingly popular investment known as zero-coupon municipal bonds. Despite their somewhat ponderous name, municipal zeros are n't all that complicated. They are close cousins, in fact, of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> savings bonds, and can be used for many of the same purposes and goals as savings bonds. One big difference: While you may well eventually have to pay taxes on the money you earn from savings bonds, there is no federal tax on income from the typical municipal zero issued by a state or local government. Savings bonds, of course, are sold through a long-established national program, and are easily accessible at banks and other financial institutions, or even from your employer through payroll deductions. Municipal zeros, which trace their origins back just a few years, are n't yet so widely available. But inquiries at brokerage firms in your area may lead you to one of several firms that creates zeros from ordinary municipal bonds through a process, called stripping, that separates them from their current interest payments. The Cleveland-based brokerage firm of <PERSON> Prescott </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Ball </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Turben </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> calls the municipal zeros it sells Stripped Tax-Exempt Participations, or STEPs. A few states, in addition, have begun offering bonds specifically designed as zeros. In December, <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> offered the first in what is planned as twice-a-year sales of College Savings Bonds with maturities of five to 20 years. For <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> residents, they are exempt from both federal and state tax. Since zeros pay no current interest, they are obviously unsuitable for people who want or need income from their investments to help them meet living expenses. Rather, they are designed to appeal to people saving for some future goal. Buyers of zeros pay a fraction of the bonds' face value that is calculated to produce a certain annual compound growth rate until the bonds are redeemed on maturity at face value. They eliminate the uncertainty that comes with conventional bonds about what reinvestment options will be available for interest as it is paid out over time. `` We can think of no investment vehicle whose results are more clearly defined,'' says <PERSON> Prescott </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Ball </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Turben in its monthly publication Investor News. `` For that reason, zeros are of great value in financial planning.'' Drawbacks and possible pitfalls? Yes, there are several. In their eagerness to get a tax break, many buyers of municipals often do n't bother to calculate whether they might actually do better, even after taxes, in some other type of investment. With a municipal zero, you can know precisely what after-tax dollar amount you can expect to receive in 1995, or 2000, or 2005. But because of inflation, there is no way of telling in advance how much purchasing power those dollars will have _ for example, whether they will cover a college tuition payment or not. Furthermore, if inflation increases, zeros offer you no protection. In fact, assuming that the general level of market interest rates rises along with inflation, the value of a zero will fall should you want to sell it before maturity. The automatic compounding feature of zeros that appeals to so many investors actually exaggerates this effect. So their market values tend to fluctuate even more than those of conventional bonds with the ups and downs of interest rates.

<HEAD>Texas Eastern `Poison Pills' Spawn Lawsuit</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Two <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> stockholders filed a lawsuit seeking to strike down anti-takeover measures they claim could block a $ 2.6 billion offer from <ORGANIZATION> Coastal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The suit filed in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> federal court Tuesday said the measures include protections designed to drastically increase the cost of buying <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and golden parachutes that would give lump-sum severance payments to some executives fired after a takeover. The suit, filed by <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> Rand </PERSON> and <PERSON> Elliot </PERSON> <PERSON> Kurlander </PERSON> both of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> state </LOCATION>, contends that <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and three directors might use such anti-takeover measures to entrench the directors' positions and to prevent shareholders from considering tender offers The suit claims that Houston-based <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and the directors could defeat Coastal's offer unless they are blocked from using `` obstructionist'' strategies. <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Wichlep </PERSON> said company officials could not comment because they had not seen the suit. Named in the suit were <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and directors <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Bufkin </PERSON>, <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hendrix </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bufkin </PERSON> is chairman of the board, King is vice chairman and <PERSON> Hendrix </PERSON> is <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s president and chief executive officer The two stockholders say in their suit that <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> took anti-takeover measures by adopting a poison pill plan. The plan, which comes into play 10 days after a takeover bid, entitles <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> shareholders to buy shares of the acquiring company at half the market cost of those shares. Golden parachutes for some executives also were put into place to thwart a takeover, the suit alleges. Golden parachutes are employment agreements that provide a company's key executives with lucrative severance benefits in the event that control of the firm changes hands and management shifts subsequently occur. The parachutes go into effect after an outsider acquires 45 percent or more of the stock or controls a majority of directors on the board. The parachutes are triggered if a new owner fires any of the top nine executives in the company, including <PERSON> Hendrix </PERSON>, any time up to three years after the takeover. The parachutes require the owner to pay the fired executive a lump sum in cash equal to four times his annual wages, including salary and bonuses; all retirement and pension benefits that the executive would have received if he had continued to work four years more; and insurance benefits for four more years. Coastal announced Monday that it would make a cash tender offer of $ 42 per share for all outstanding <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> common stock on Tuesday. The offer expires Feb. 13, unless it is extended. If the buyout is successful, Houston-based Coastal would become the nation's largest natural gas pipeline company. <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> stock was the most active on the New York Stock Exchange Tuesday. It closed up 1 -RRB- at 46, after rising 14 -RCB- on Monday. Coastal stock closed at 34 Tuesday, down an eighth.

<HEAD>Say SEC Wants Drexel's Junk Bond Operation Moved to New York</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Subs 8th graf with no comment from SEC spokeswoman.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> wants <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> to move its lucrative `` junk bond'' division from <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> as a condition for settling a massive fraud complaint against the firm, sources familiar with their negotiations said today. The sources, speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed an account in the Wall Street Journal that said <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> negotiators made the demand in talks late last week, toughening an earlier request that <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> only move its supervision authority over the division to the firm's <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> headquarters. The new condition is important because <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> must settle with the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> as part of a broader plea bargain deal reached Dec. 21 with the <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's office. Under that deal, the firm will plead guilty to six fraud felonies and pay a record $ 650 million in fines and restitution. <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>'s high-yield `` junk bond'' division is considered the firm's most profitable operation. Dismantling and moving it to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> could cripple <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>'s renowned prowess in the $ 175 billion market for junk bonds, commonly used to finance takeovers and the growth of small and midsize companies. The new <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> demand came at a time when many <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> high-yield bond traders already are upset over the firm's decision to reach a plea bargain with the government rather than fight longstanding charges of securities fraud that grew out of the <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> insider trading scandal more than two years ago. <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Anreder </PERSON> declined to comment on the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> negotiations or whether they were close to resolution. But he said the firm `` does not believe the high-yield bond department can be successfully mmoved to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> since any effort to do so would destroy the department and do irreparable damage to the high-yield market.'' <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> McCue </PERSON> declined to comment on the <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> negotiations. The agency's policy is to refrain from commenting on any impending enforcement matter. The high-yield department was moved from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> in 1978 by its architect <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>, a senior <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> financier who is expected to be indicted on securities fraud and other charges. Unlike <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> has continued to assert his innocence but has been under intensifying pressure to negotiate a plea bargain. The <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> accused <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> and three other senior aides of wide-ranging fraud in a civil enforcement action filed in September. Most of the accusations were linked to <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>'s relationship with <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>, the now-imprisoned inside trader who turned state's evidence in exchange for lenient treatment.

<HEAD>IBM Earnings Rise 12.4 Percent In Quarter</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: New thruout to ADD Wang Laboratories earnings; fall in IBM stock
price; analyst quotes.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said today its earnings rose 12.4 percent in the fourth quarter and that it had trimmed its staff even more than expected through voluntary separation incentives. The stock fell 75 cents a share at $ 123.12 -LCB- a share in morning trading on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, apparently because <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> told some analysts that its tax rate might be higher and its revenue lower in 1989 than the analysts had forecasted. The world's largest computer company said it earned $ 2.35 billion, or $ 3.97 a share, up from $ 2.09 billion, or $ 3.47 a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose to $ 20.0 billion from $ 18.3 billion in the year-earlier period. For all of 1988, <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> said its earnings rose 10.4 percent to $ 5.81 billion, or $ 9.80 a share, from $ 5.26 billion, or $ 8.72 a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 8 percent to $ 59.7 billion from $ 55.3 billion. Also today, <ORGANIZATION> Wang </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said its earnings tumbled to $ 1 million, or 1 cent per share, in its second fiscal quarter, from $ 34.1 million, or 21 cents a share, a year earlier. The office-automation company said revenue fell to $ 760.7 million from $ 784.7 million a year earlier. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Akers </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>'s chairman and chief executive, said <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> benefited from increases in efficiency as well as positive response by customers to improved products `` in every segment of our business.'' <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> said it recorded a gain of $ 220 million on payments from <ORGANIZATION> Fujitsu </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, its Japanese rival, under an arbitration order that ended a software copyright dispute. But that gain was more than offset by a charge of $ 270 million to cover unexpected costs of consolidating its operations. The company said 6,500 employees had chosen to leave the company under a voluntary separation incentive program, even more than the 4,000 that the company had expected when it announced the program as part of a $ 600 million consolidation program. The separation offer was made to some manufacturing and headquarters employees. <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Marti </PERSON> <PERSON> Mattia </PERSON> said it had been especially popular with heaquarters employees. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, an analyst for <ORGANIZATION> SoundView </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Stamford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, said he had heard that <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> told some analysts its 1989 tax rate might be 2 percentage points higher than in 1988, and that revenue growth might be 1 percentage point lower than some analysts' forecasts. <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> said fourth-quarter results were good. `` Revenue is strong and operating margins improved nicely,'' he said. `` It was a good quarter,'' said <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, an analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` Some hot money moved in to anticipate a better-than-expected quarter'' and moved out when the hopes failed to materialize, he said, explaining the stock drop. `` The <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> company is continuing to show improvement in our product line, our relationships with our customers and our financial performance,'' <PERSON> Akers </PERSON> said. `` We are managing for the long term, and with the steps we are taking, we remain confident about the future of our business.'' <ORGANIZATION> Wang </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Lowell </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, said its earnings for the six months ended Dec. 31 were $ 14.1 million, or 9 cents a share, down from $ 56.6 million, or 34 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue edged up to $ 1.483 billion from $ 1.477 billion a year earlier. The <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> announcements came a day after <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> announced a 16 percent earnings gain in its fourth quarter.

<HEAD>Court Strikes Down West Virginia County Property Tax</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> today unanimously struck down a tax in a <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> county </LOCATION> that permitted some property to be taxed at up to 35 times more than neighboring comparable property. But the court, referring to the county tax as `` aberrational,'' declined to say whether similar state taxes also are unconstitutional. The ruling thus appears to leave untouched ironically named state `` welcome stranger'' property tax systems that result in dramatically higher taxes for newly purchased property. A `` welcome stranger'' provision is a key part of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s Proposition 13 property tax rollback approved by that state's voters The court today threw out a <LOCATION> Webster </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> W. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, tax that was challenged principally by <ORGANIZATION> Allegheny </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> Allegheny </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION> The coal company opposed a change that raised the assessed value of 7,400 acres of <LOCATION> Webster </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> land it owned from $ 488,000 to $ 12.3 million in one year. The company bought the land in 1974 for about $ 24.6 million and sold it, along with mineral rights, for $ 29.8 million in 1982. Three other coal companies, <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kentucky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Oneida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Shamrock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION>, joined the challenge. <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kentucky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> is a subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Oneida and <PERSON> Shamrock </PERSON> are subsidiaries of <ORGANIZATION> Sun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. Chief Justice <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON>, writing for the court today, said <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>'s Constitution and laws `` provide that all property of the kind held by -LRB- the coal companies -RRB- shall be taxed at a rate uniform throughout the state according to its estimated market The relative undervaluation of comparable property in <LOCATION> Webster </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> over time therefore denies -LRB- the coal companies -RRB- the equal protection of law.'' In a key footnote, <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON> said, `` We need not and do not decide today whether the <LOCATION> Webster </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> assessment method would stand on a different footing if it were the law of a state generally applied instead of the aberrational enforcement policy it appears to be.'' For example, Proposition 13 in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> generally provides that property will be assessed at its 1975-l976 value and reassessed only when sold or improved through construction. The premise is that the taxes should be based on the original cost of property and not on unrealized paper gains pegged to inflation. Today's ruling overturned a 1987 decision by the <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>. The case is <ORGANIZATION> Allegheny </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> vs. <LOCATION> Webster </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, 87-1303.

 The Chevrolet Camaro is continuing its lock on the No. 1 spot on a vehicle valuation services's list of most-stolen cars. Certified <ORGANIZATION> Collateral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, which sets values of stolen vehicles for insurance companies, said today the 1986 Camaro was the most-stolen car in 1988. It was followed by the 1987 Camaro, the 1984 Camaro, the 1985 Camaro and the 1981 Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme. The company began compiling lists of the most frequently reported stolen domestic and imported cars in 1985, and every year since then a Camaro has topped the domestic list, <ORGANIZATION> CCC </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Figel </PERSON> said. Among imported cars, the 1987 <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Excel </ORGANIZATION> topped the 1988 CCC list. It was followed by the 1985 Mazda RX7 GT and Toyota Corollas from 1983, 1982 and 1981. For its 1988 list, <ORGANIZATION> CCC </ORGANIZATION> compiled 111,440 insurance claims for stolen cars. The company defined a stolen car as one in which the entire vehicle was taken, and did not include break-ins or wheel thefts, for example. The 1986 Camaro amounted to 0.9 percent of the theft claims handled by CCC.

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit widened dramatically to $ 12.5 billion in November, the largest imbalance in five months, the government said today. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the gap between what the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> imports and what it sells overseas was 21.9 percent higher than the October deficit of $ 10.3 billion. The sharply higher deficit was blamed on a big jump in imports, which shot up to $ 39.7 billion, $ 1.6 billion above the October level. Exports, which have been booming this year, declined by $ 639 million to $ 27.2 billion. The November deficit was the largest since a $ 13.2 billion imbalance in June. In the past, a sharp worsening of the nation's trade performance has sent shock waves through financial markets. However, today's report had less of an impact The Dow Jones average of 30 industrial stocks edged down by more than 6 points in early trading but gainers slightly outnumbered losers in nationwide trading of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Stock Exchange-listed issues. `` The markets took this trade number in stride and went on,'' said <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldinger </PERSON>, chief economist of <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insight </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, investment firm. However, economists said the big jump in the November deficit showed that the country has a long way to go before its trade difficulties are over. `` We have a serious competitiveness problem in this country,'' said <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Chimerine </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Wefa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, an economic consulting firm. `` There's a limit to how much you can improve by cutting costs and driving the dollar lower.'' At the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said: `` It is true there is a slight jump this month, and that is always of concern, but it does fly in the face of a trend that is going down and in the right direction, and we trust that this is an aberration and does not change the overall trend.'' Commerce Secretary <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Verity </PERSON> termed the report `` disappointing. While our exports remain strong, the robust domestic economy continues to draw in imports at near-record levels and the trade deficit remains too high.'' <ORGANIZATION> Verity </ORGANIZATION> said that while the trade deficit was running 20 percent below the all-time high set in 1987, the improvement has leveled off in recent months. `` All of this means that we have a long way to go,'' he said in a statement. `` We must continue to improve our efficiency and quality at home and pursue our efforts to reduce trade barriers abroad.'' In other economic reports today, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> said that the operating rate at U.C. factories, mines and utilities rose in December to 84.2 percent, the highest rate in nine years. Even with the November deterioration, the trade deficit for the first 11 months of 1988 was running at an annual rate of $ 137.3 billion, almost 20 percent below the all-time imbalance of $ 170.3 billion set in 1987. This big improvement in trade has been largely responsible for the overall prosperity the country enjoyed last year. But analysts have begun to worry that the trade improvement, which was powered by a surge in export sales, is in danger of stalling out this year. If that occurs, it raises the threat that the new <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration will have to deal with a possible recession, or at the very least that the new president will be faced with growing cries to erect new trade barriers to protect American manufacturers. `` This is curtains for any hope that we are going to get the trade deficit under control any time soon,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, head of a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> economic forecasting firm. Many economists believe that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar will have to fall further to spur further sales of American exports. But the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration is worried that sharp declines in the dollar could worsen <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> inflation by increasing the cost of imports. For November, the 4.2 percent rise in imports reflected big increases in imports of business capital equipment, which rose by $ 1.1 billion, and consumer goods other than autos, which climbed by $ 697 million. The rise in capital goods reflected increases in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> purchases of iron and steel products, airplanes and heavy equipment such as metal working machinery. American industry has been rushing to expand and modernize production facilities to meet increased demand. However, much of the expansion has come through the purchase of foreign capital equipment. The auto category actually dropped by $ 229 million during November. The nation's foreign oil bill fell a slight 0.4 percent to $ 3.13 billion, reflecting a drop in both the amount of oil imported and the price, which fell to an average price of $ 13.38 per barrel. The 2.3 percent drop in exports in November reflected declines in sales of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> farm products and capital goods. By country, the deficit with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> was the largest, a $ 5.3 billion imbalance, followed by a $ 2 billion deficit with <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The overall trade figures are adjusted to reflect normal seasonal variations. The deficits with individual countries are not. <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> said he expected the deficit would be frozen at the current high levels for all of 1989 as the demand for foreign goods on the part of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> consumers shows little sign of slacking despite the higher prices. `` This is curtains for any hope that we are going to get the trade deficit under control anytime soon,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, another consulting firm, is also predicting little progress on the trade front this year based on a belief that higher prices for imported goods will largely offset further gains in export sales. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration launched an effort in September 1985 to drive the value of the dollar lower to make <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> goods more competitive on overseas markets. The effort took far longer to show results than many had expected and has yet to dampen the steady increase in imports even though the products now cost more.

<HEAD>17 Percent Of Biggest U.S. Firms Were Wooed By Foreigners In 1988:
Survey</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Foreign firms approached 17 percent of the largest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies about possible takeovers last year, according to a study released today by <ORGANIZATION> Northwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Kellogg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Graduate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION>. Only a handful of such initial approaches by overseas firms became public or amounted to a bid, the survey found. The study _ a survey of the chief executive officers of 95 corporations with annual sales of at least $ 1 billion _ also found that while 60 percent of the respondents felt foreign ownership tends to maximize shareholder value, just over half said they would prefer a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> firm as a new owner if they were taken over. Slightly less than 23 percent of the CEOs reported being approached by a prospective domestic buyer last year. Two-thirds of the chief executives responding to the survey said they were more interested in joint ventures and similar linkups with foreign companies than they were in selling. Northwestern University Professor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Zajac </PERSON>, project director for the survey, said he was surprised by the number of firms that reported overtures by foreign companies. <PERSON> Zajac </PERSON> said the survey showed `` the world is getting smaller'' and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> firms are finding that to survive in an increasingly complex world, they must turn to international alliances.

The cars, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s largest, are being redesigned for the 1992 model year. Company sources confirmed there would be a major investment but declined to disclose the amount. One member of <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> management said an important announcement was expected this month. Workers said they learned of the proposed spending plans from a bulletin distributed in the plant. Some union members said they believe the spending plan ensures that <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> will keep the plant open through the 1990s. There has been concern among union members that the plant, which employs 2,800, might be phased out. In addition to the new presses and other machinery, the company also will be earmarking funds for use in moving rail lines inside the plant. The <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> spending plan follows an announcement last July that <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> was investing $ 80 million in the <ORGANIZATION> Chevrolet-Pontiac-Canada </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tonawanda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plant </ORGANIZATION> to build Chevrolet's new eight-cylinder Mark V engine. Early this month it was learned that <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> planned another $ 26 million expenditure to increase the plant's production of its popular six-cylinder, 4.3-liter engine.

<HEAD>Codfish ``Curio'' Leads Portuguese Quality Wine Assault</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TONY SMITH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>AZEITAO, Portugal (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Would you believe a wine called `` Codfish Manor?'' You should when it's a fine Portuguese red, grown by Americans on their 15th century manor, then marketed by a hard-hitting Australian intent on changing <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>'s image as the purveyor of cheap and unrefined wine. Quinta de Bacalhoa _ old <LOCATION> Portuguese </LOCATION> for <LOCATION> Codfish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Manor </LOCATION> _ is a <ORGANIZATION> Cabernet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sauvignon </ORGANIZATION> from <LOCATION> Bordeaux </LOCATION> vines planted in 1974 by <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> and <PERSON> Cathryn </PERSON> <PERSON> Scoville </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> on their 30 acre renaissance-style farm or `` quinta'' in the village of <LOCATION> Azeitao </LOCATION> 25 miles south of <LOCATION> Lisbon </LOCATION>. The Scovilles inherited Bacalhoa from <PERSON> Tom </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> grandmother <PERSON> Orlena </PERSON> <PERSON> Scoville </PERSON>, who bought it tumbledown in the 1930s and restored it to a grandeur once known under the original constructor, the mother of King Manuel I. Since the first harvest in 1979, <PERSON> Bacalhoa </PERSON> red has become one of <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>'s better-known `` curio'' vintages that are beginning to rival the worldwide fame of historical exports like port and <LOCATION> madeira </LOCATION>. `` In <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>, single quinta wines like this are sold as high-quality, connoisseur wines, in other European countries as a quality value-for-money wine and in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as a bit of a ` curio' wine,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Bright </PERSON>, an energetic Australian enologist who produces and markets Bacalhoa at <PERSON> Joao </PERSON> <PERSON> Pires </PERSON> wineries in <LOCATION> Pinhal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Novo </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Azeitao </LOCATION>. Bright arrived from <LOCATION> Sydney </LOCATION> in 1980 and revolutionized the company's antiquated winemaking processes _ developing brand names and mass-producing wines for other exporters. Ninety percent of the company's mass-produced wine goes under contract to rival winery <ORGANIZATION> Fonseca </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> for their famous Lancers brand. But Bright sticks to more traditional methods for finishing <PERSON> Bacalhoa </PERSON>. The wine is fermented without stems, painstakingly clarified with egg whites and aged for five years in <LOCATION> Portuguese </LOCATION> oak barrels, toasted on the inside to give the wine, Bright says, a different taste from regular Cabernets. It seems tradition pays off. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Sunday </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> called <LOCATION> Bacalhoa </LOCATION> `` <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>'s award-winning answer to claret,'' when it won that paper's 1984 Wine of the Year award. According to the monthly wine magazine Decanter, <PERSON> Bacalhoa </PERSON>'s `` provenance will fool most party guests. More than half the annual 8,000-case production goes abroad, with one-fourth of the exports secured by the British grocer-chain <ORGANIZATION> Sainsbury </ORGANIZATION> _ the Scovilles' first buyer in 1979. With all of <LOCATION> Bacalhoa </LOCATION> already devoted to vines, and only two small nearby areas having suitable red limestone soil, expansion is impossible. But many <LOCATION> Portuguese </LOCATION> vintners agree that single-quinta wines should not be produced en masse, but rather be the `` flagship'' of the country's wine industry. These wines constitute only a fraction of <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>'s table wine exports, but the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> hopes their high quality will change foreign connoisseurs' perceptions that wine from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> can only be port or a famous rose. `` <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> has great potential to produce wines of similar quality to the minor French classics,'' Bright says. The <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> says <LOCATION> Portuguese </LOCATION> table wine exports fetched $ 3 billion in 1987, up from $ 2.6 billion a year earlier. Exports to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> increased by 11 percent to 2.2 million gallons in 1987 from 1986, while the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market share of rival wine exporters in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> fell. But if quality is the theme of <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>'s push to become a fine wine exporter, wine buffs <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Metcalfe </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kathryn </PERSON> <PERSON> McWhirter </PERSON> are cautious. In their book `` The Wines of <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>,'' they see only a limited prospect for quality control. Part of the reason is the temptation among some vintners to sacrifice good standards for more sales. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinto </PERSON>, a vintner of the northern winery <ORGANIZATION> Borges </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Irmao, also has expressed concern about the outlook for the industry because competitors are sharply discounting. He said quinta wines `` are the crowning achievement of Portuguese winemaking, but worrying signs have begun to appear that some exporters, greedy for market share, are offering wines at 30 percent below market price.'' He said there is concern that the Portuguese may fall into the same trap that hurt German winemakers, who lost a substantial part of their 40 percent share of the British market when standards fell following a price-cutting war among exporters.

<HEAD>Sears' Savior Rises To A New Challenge</HEAD>
<HEAD>LaserPhoto CX3 of Jan. 16</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A cold late-afternoon rain whipped the dark surfaces of the looming Sears Tower while, inside, <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> rose to make a crucial sales pitch to a roomful of skeptical stock analysts. The chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Roebuck </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> had to be tired. He'd spent nearly two hours that morning outlining a major shift in <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>' retailing strategy to securities analysts in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Here he was back in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, doing it again. If <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> was beat, he did n't show it. Looking poised and confident in a dark gray suit and red tie, he stood at the podium for 1 -LCB- hours and painted a bright, if blurry, picture of the new <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> store. A `` store of superstores.'' A cluster of `` power centers.'' A lean competitor fit for battle with K mart, <ORGANIZATION> Wal-Mart </ORGANIZATION> and the electronics specialty chains. He said <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>' planned switch to `` everyday low pricing,'' a strategy unveiled a week earlier, on Halloween, was `` designed to energize our company and move us forward from a position of leadership.'' The proposed sale of the <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tower </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> said, signaled the company's commitment to `` a low-cost mentality.'' When it was over, many of the analysts remained unconvinced that <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> was on the right track _ the one that would reverse a 4-year slide in its retailing market share and signal a return to steady profit growth. Some were disappointed that <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> had not offered a more detailed description of the <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> store he sees emerging. One thing was clear: <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>' 54-year-old chairman had taken hold with both hands of the latest and perhaps the most crucial challenge facing the nation's largest retailer. History has shown that when <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> tackles a <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> retailing problem, he ususally solves it. <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> has been called a retailing genius, and leading 103-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> into its second century has been called his destiny. His 29-year climb from men's furnishings at a <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> store in <LOCATION> Madison </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, to the chairman's office on the 68th floor of the <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tower </ORGANIZATION> _ a rapid ascent by big-business standards _ is the stuff of corporate legends. The fact that he began his working life as a scrappy Irish kid from a broken home on <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s West Side makes his a classic, up-by-his-bootstraps American success story as well. But it is <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON>'s ties to <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>' past _ his grandfather, father, mother and two uncles labored for the company _ and his triumphant turnaround of its fortunes in the early 1980s as head of the merchandise group, that already have reserved for him a place in the <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> pantheon of heroes and saviors. Such an honor is not easily won. `` Sears is his life,'' said <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Harmon </PERSON>, retired head of public affairs for <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> who now lives in <LOCATION> Albuquerque </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.M. </LOCATION> `` More than anyone I know, he's been completely involved in <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>. He pretty much lives his work.'' Others have speculated that <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>' chairman since October 1985, will work to death. But in a recent interview in a <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tower </ORGANIZATION> conference room overlooking <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s sprawling <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Side </LOCATION>, he was relaxed and congenial. `` The Lord has blessed me with pretty good energy and we usually go at it pretty strong,'' <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> said with a grin that cracked an eye-level crease across his broad face. <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON>'s amiable air cooled when asked whether <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> _ the originator of mail-order sales and one of the first retailers to offer credit to shoppers _ had become a follower in its decision to embrace everyday low pricing. The strategy, pioneered by discount chains, was recently adopted by <ORGANIZATION> Montgomery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ward </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, also based in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and run by <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON>'s younger brother, <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> `` One could say why not two, three, four years ago,'' <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> said. `` Obviously, we think this is the time to make the change and we are doing it.'' Everday low pricing means carrying many national brands and offering them regularly at low prices, often with few salespeople. The shift marks a sharp turn in direction for <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>, which built its business on store brands such as <LOCATION> Kenmore </LOCATION>, Craftsman and DieHard, with frequent, heavily advertised sales on selected models. <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> acknowledged that the switch, which will be implemented this year, represent `` a major change for us.'' But he said it posed a different challenge than the `` Store of the Future'' changeover he engineered in the early 1980s. `` It's not as major a change as that because it does n't involve physical remodeling of stores and it will take place in a more concentrated period of time,'' he said. `` This is much less of a physical challenge than the Store of the Future. It's more of a marketing challenge.'' But, <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> said, `` it's important to note that you are never at the point where it's done. `` When we get to the point where everyday low pricing is implemented, we still will be changing and growing. That's one of the things that makes retailing so exciting: you're never there.'' <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> is more than a retailer of merchandise. It's financial businesses _ <ORGANIZATION> Allstate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Coldwell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Real </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Estate </ORGANIZATION> _ brought in 42 percent of the company's $ 48.44 billion in revenues in 1987 <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> is comfortable with the financial-services businesses, but he grew passionate while discussing what he called `` the lure, the magic of retailing.'' `` There's a very specific challenge that you can see, feel touch and smell,'' he said. `` And when you address that challenge, you can see the results very quickly and you get a real feeling of satisfaction from that.'' On a larger scale, <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> hopes to increase job satisfaction among employees of the <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Merchandise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> by moving the 8,000-person division out of the <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tower </ORGANIZATION> and into more horizontal surroundings. The company has not yet decided whether to keep the division's headquarters in the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> area. `` When you are housed in a vertical structure, you have less people interaction than when you are in a low-rise, campus-type environment,'' he said. `` You have a more cohesive organization when there's more people interaction.'' <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON>, a golf and tennis player in his leisure time, called running <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> `` a very stimulating, challenging, engrossing experience'' but said he occasionally toys with teaching at a graduate business school. <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> and his wife <PERSON> Lois </PERSON>, the childhood sweetheart he married in 1955, have raised six children and some work for other retailers. <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> said he's never pushed them to join <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>. `` I think it puts pressure on members of a family to work in a company where the father is in a high position,'' he said. Besides, `` it's not my decision. I think they're very happy doing what they're doing.''

<HEAD>London Shares Surge To Close At New Post-Crash High</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Despite disappointment with the latest set of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade figures, <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> stocks extended their recent broad-based rally in active trading Wednesday, reaching their best levels since the 1987 stock crash. The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-stock index closed up 24.4 points, or 1.3 percent, at 1,892.1, well above the previous post-crash closing high of 1,879.3, reached in June. Volume also continued its recent brisk pace, with 603 million shares changing hands, compared with 424.4 million shares on Tuesday. Equities took their cue from the dollar, which also successfully weathered news that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit was a wider-than-expected $ 12.5 billion in November, dealers and analysts said. A buying spree by institutions drove prices higher in early trading. In addition, a shortage of stock held by market makers discouraged any fall in prices even after business tapered off, dealers said. `` <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> has been rather late as far as other equity markets go in reaching a post-crash high,'' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, equities market strategist at <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Funding </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd </ORGANIZATION>. Sentiment has turned bullish amid growing evidence of a cooling of inflationary pressures on the British economy, the analyst said.

<HEAD>Dollar Surges Despite Intervention, Trade Report; Gold Steady</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: AMer planned by 5:30 p.m. EST</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The dollar defied gravity in hectic European trading Wednesday, surging despite a bearish set of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade figures and two reported rounds of central bank intervention. Gold prices were mostly higher. Dealers were surprised by the dollar's ability to shrug off the bearish factors, and predicted the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency would rise further. News that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit widened sharply to $ 12.5 billion in November from a revised $ 10.3 billion in October surprised the market and knocked the dollar down, dealers said. The market expected a November deficit of about $ 11 billion. Dealers said the dollar's reaction reflected a markdown in rates rather than any heavy selling, and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency immediately bounced higher. That triggered a round of concerted intervention by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>, the West German <ORGANIZATION> Bundesbank </ORGANIZATION> and the central banks of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, dealers said. Despite the first round of intervention, the dollar continued to climb higher, and a second round of dollar sales by the <ORGANIZATION> Bundesbank </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>, and the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canada </ORGANIZATION> also failed to have much impact, dealers said. The intervention appeared to be fairly light, one dealer said. The dollar's recovery was aided by a few large buy orders that triggered a snowballing rally, a dealer said. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the dollar gained against the British pound. It cost $ 1.7550 to buy one pound, cheaper than $ 1.7680 late Tuesday. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, compared with late Tuesday's prices, included: 1.8705 West German marks, up from 1.8505; 1.5890 Swiss francs, up from 1.5755; 6.3800 French francs, up from 6.3085; 2.0925 Dutch guilders, up from 2.0855; 1,356.75 Italian lire, up from 1,354.00; and 1.1937 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1973 In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, the dollar rose 0.20 Japanese yen to a closing 127.90 yen. Later, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it was quoted at 128.45 yen. Gold held steady in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. The late bid price was $ 402.25 a troy ounce, unchanged from late Tuesday. In <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, gold closed at a bid $ 402.40, compared with $ 402.15 bid late Tuesday. Earlier, in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, gold rose 21 cents to close at a bid $ 404.64. Silver bullion rose on the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> market to a late bid price of $ 5.94 a troy ounce from $ 5.92 bid late Tuesday.

 A slightly balding man in his mid 30s sits on a deserted beach with his golden retriever and ponders aloud, `` Some things in life are as inevitable as the tide.'' In a television and magazine ad campaign that began early last month, <ORGANIZATION> Upjohn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> is taking a low-key approach _ not necessarily by choice _ to market its hair-loss remedy, Rogaine. Results appear mixed: the company says it is pleased with Rogaine sales but some industry watchers say it's too early to tell if the drug is a success. The marketing approach is so subtle that the ads mention neither Rogaine nor its active ingredient, minoxidil, although they do name <ORGANIZATION> Upjohn </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Adminstration </ORGANIZATION>, which approved Rogaine sales last fall, does not allow any mention of drugs in advertisements unless there also is full disclosure of any warnings and potential side effects. `` Our message is that if you're concerned about hair loss, there's treatment available and you should see your doctor,'' <ORGANIZATION> Upjohn </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Kaye </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said Tuesday. `` We want to get across that it's OK to do something about it. There's been a taboo on this kind of thing for too long.'' The ads appear in such male-oriented magazines as Gentlemen's Quarterly, <ORGANIZATION> Golf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Digest </ORGANIZATION>, Sports Illustrated and <ORGANIZATION> Road </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Track, plus such mainstream publications as Time, <ORGANIZATION> Newsweek </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> BusinessWeek </ORGANIZATION>, People and <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Today </ORGANIZATION> The one television commercial, which features the same actor as the magazine ad, is appearing on the three major networks and on independent stations, especially during sporting events. Some analysts believe the ads for the first medically-proven hair restorer are too subtle. `` They ca n't use the name, but the treatment in the ad is n't even referred to as a drug,'' said <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Nordmann </PERSON>, a research analyst with <ORGANIZATION> PaineWebber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` Consequently, the viewer does n't know if the available treatment is a hair weave, a transplant, a drug or anything.'' Kalamazoo-based <ORGANIZATION> Upjohn </ORGANIZATION> is n't worried about Rogaine's name recognition among consumers. `` The reception our sales force has gotten -LRB- from the medical community -RRB- is tremendous,'' said <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Thieme </PERSON>, product manager for Rogaine. `` We've gotten a very good reaction to the ads. ... We think people appreciate the very low-key approach.'' <ORGANIZATION> Upjohn </ORGANIZATION> does not release sales figures for individual products, but <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said the company is very pleased with Rogaine's sales. Some analysts, however, have been disappointed with <ORGANIZATION> Upjohn </ORGANIZATION>'s stock performance since the drug was introduced in September `` The product is n't doing very well, but it's too early to tell whether it'll be successful and how consumers will react to the advertising,'' <PERSON> Nordmann </PERSON> said. `` The investor is disappointed because he focused too much attention on Rogaine too early.'' <ORGANIZATION> Upjohn </ORGANIZATION> traded at $ 29.75 a share late Wednesday on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, below its 52-week high of $ 35.25. At <ORGANIZATION> Oakwood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plaza </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pharmacy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Kalamazoo </LOCATION>, pharmacist <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Shane </PERSON> said Rogaine's sales have risen 25 percent since the advertising campaign began. `` Sales are increasing, but I would n't exactly get excited about it,'' <PERSON> Shane </PERSON> said. `` More people are asking about it than buying it.'' Minoxidil has been advertised in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> since 1986. A few of the other 45 countries in which minoxidil is available have had limited advertising campaigns, <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Upjohn </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> campaign marks a departure from the company's tradition of advertising only in medical journals `` This is a very unique situation. Being a prescription drug, we're under some restrictions that a lot of other advertisers are n't under,'' <PERSON> Thieme </PERSON> said `` We do n't want to over-promise in the ads; that will only hurt us.'' One reason for caution is that in testing 2,300 men at 27 medical centers, Rogaine had only a 39 percent success rate. <ORGANIZATION> Upjohn </ORGANIZATION> said those with the best chance of success are men younger than 40 who have been losing their hair for 10 years or less and who have an area of baldness four inches in diameter or less on the crown of the head. The target audience for the advertising campaign is men between the ages of 25 and 44 and those with an annual income of $ 35,000 or more, <PERSON> Nordmann </PERSON> said. A one-month supply of the drug, which comes in a bottle with rub-on or spray applicators, retails for about $ 60. The drug must be used regularly in order to maintain new hair growth.

 Profound changes are at work in the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>, sent reeling this decade with blows to its auto, steel and farming powerhouses. For autos, the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> was the place, <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> the hub. <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> also boasted auto plants. Now, Japanese automakers are setting up shop in rural, largely white communities and jobs are becoming increasingly scarce for big-city blacks. The first story in a four-part AP Extra series, `` The Changing Heartland,'' examines this trend.

 With a college campus and fertile fields, this patch of <ORGANIZATION> mid-America </ORGANIZATION> is a place where students learn and farmers earn side by side. But corn country has a new face producing a new crop _ cars. Last fall, this tranquil town and its twin city, <LOCATION> Bloomington </LOCATION>, joined a growing number of smaller <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> locales with Japanese-associated plants that are shaking up the auto industry. The increasing Japanese presence in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s midsection _ plants in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, one planned for <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Chrysler-Mitsubishi </PERSON> here _ is creating work and growth in white rural areas while jobs and opportunity disappear in heavily minority big cities. `` Certainly, it's a restructuring of the auto industry,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> urban affairs and sociology professor. `` The reorganization ... is definitely detrimental to blacks.'' The trend has aroused concern in a business that's already lost thousands of blue-collar jobs, raised questions about potential bias, and worried blacks, who've long regarded the auto industry as a steppingstone to a better life. `` Auto shops were really the bridge that brought black people from the lower class to the middle class,'' said <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, former head of a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> local at a closed <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> plant. `` What are you going to do for the people left behind, locked up in the ghetto who have no place to go and no car to get out to rural areas?'' Japanese automakers, who've invested $ 5 billion in U.S.-based facilities in the last decade, point to their affirmative action programs and insist transportation, education and the work ethic _ not race _ determine location. But some academics also claim the Japanese generally avoid unionized areas and towns with large pools of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> autoworkers, preferring to train novices. Whatever the reason, communities such as Bloomington-Normal _ thriving, white-collar towns that are worlds apart from gasping-for-survival, blue-collar cities like <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> _ are becoming motor capitals. `` It's just a different culture,'' said <LOCATION> Bloomington </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Smart </PERSON>. `` This whole city is like a big neighborhood. -LRB- And -RRB- with modern auto plants being clean, it's not smokestack anymore; it's compatible with agriculture. In Bloomington-Normal, insurance, farming and academia are big. Urban blight, crime and unemployment are not. Bloomington-Normal, 4 percent minority, had a 4.1 percent unemployment rate in October. <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, 65 percent minority, had a 10.1 percent jobless level. Studies have shown black men have been devastated by industrial decline. In the <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> area, 52 percent of black men in heavy manufacturing production lost their jobs from 1979 to 1984, according to a study by <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> State's <PERSON> Hill </PERSON>. Nationwide, about 27 percent of blacks lost their heavy manufacturing jobs in the same period, said the study, based on <ORGANIZATION> Equal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opportunity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> reports. Future prospects are even bleaker. A 1988 study concluded Japanese `` behavior with regard to site location and hiring practices heightens rather than eases the dilemma of blacks who are being rapidly displaced from their traditional American employers.'' The study, by <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> professors <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON> and <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Deskins </PERSON>, said although they had no concrete evidence, they believe `` avoidance of blacks is one factor'' for the Japanese in determining plant sites. `` I think it's a factor,'' <PERSON> Deskins </PERSON> said. `` I ca n't say this is their intent.'' The study found while blacks comprise 11 percent of the civilian labor force, they represent 17.2 percent of workers at the Big Three <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> automakers. In contrast, the study said, <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturing </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION> -RRB- <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s plant in <LOCATION> Flat </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, has a potential black labor pool of 29 percent and <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, in <LOCATION> Marysville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, has one of 10.5 percent. Company officials say their black workforce is 15.1 percent and 5.1 percent, respectively. <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Lambert </PERSON> disagreed with the calculations and also pointed out the company recruits at black colleges. <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION>, however, agreed last March to give $ 6 million to 377 blacks and women after an <ORGANIZATION> EEOC </ORGANIZATION> investigation concluded they should have been hired sooner. The <ORGANIZATION> EEOC </ORGANIZATION> claimed <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION> employed discriminatory practices with a 30-mile hiring radius that excluded <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, which has the area's largest minority population. <ORGANIZATION> Honda </ORGANIZATION>, which expanded its hiring area before the settlement, admitted no wrongdoing. Many Japanese-associated auto plants are close to universities and near Interstate 75, dubbed Auto Alley, which stretches south from <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> is in <LOCATION> Georgetown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, near the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kentucky </ORGANIZATION>; Chrysler-Mitsubishi is in Normal, home of <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, while <ORGANIZATION> Subaru-Isuzu </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Automotive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> is near <LOCATION> Lafayette </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, across the river from <LOCATION> Purdue </LOCATION>. These towns say automakers are attracted to cheaper land, lower taxes, open space and a well-educated work force. Bloomington-Normal, population 87,718, was appealing because of its good highway and rail systems, incentives, strong work ethic and schools, said <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON>, former chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Diamond-Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the firm formed by <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION>. `` We needed people with very good communication skills _ verbal, written and reading,'' he said. `` Some of the major larger cities have a very difficult time graduating significant numbers of students.'' In <LOCATION> Tippecanoe </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, surrounding <LOCATION> Lafayette </LOCATION>, one in four people 25 years and older has four years of college, said <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Greater </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lafayette </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Progress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a non-profit development corporation. `` What kind of public education system does <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> have?'' he asked. `` What kind of technological capability in terms of college graduates does <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> have? `` There's no God-given right big cities should be viewed as the automotive centers,'' he said. `` We small towns, technologically sophisticated centers, think we can compete, too.''

 They do, engaging in fierce bidding wars, offering free land and water, road and sewer improvements, employee training funds and tax abatements. Chrysler-Mitsubishi received $ 88.7 million in state incentives alone, including 630 acres of farm land. `` Nobody ever offered us a site in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> ... Detroit ... -LRB- or -RRB- <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON> said. Experts also say Japanese automakers prefer areas where unions are n't strong. `` They're afraid wages will be high,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` They're afraid unions will create demands that will make the company unproductive.'' <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION> is atypical _ it is 25 miles from <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> and, spokesman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Gill </PERSON> said, the only wholly owned subsidiary of a Japanese automaker with <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> affiliation. `` If you're going to locate in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Gill </PERSON> said, `` you best be prepared to deal with the <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION>.'' <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION>, because of its location, also has many former Big Three employees _ nearly a fourth of its workers. But <PERSON> Vladmir </PERSON> <PERSON> Pucik </PERSON>, international business professor at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION>, said the Japanese prefer `` a relatively inexperienced labor force so they can train them in the Japanese way of doing things. They want to go somewhere so nobody will say, ` At <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>, we did it differently.'' <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON> conceded Chrysler-Mitsubishi sought fresh faces. `` We did n't want to have another car plant that -LRB- would -RRB- have 20 years of experience transferred to our plant,'' he said. `` We wanted some green people when it comes to building cars.'' But he said any suggestion race was involved in site selection was `` utter nonsense'' and any charge `` we selected a town to stay away from a union ... is absolutely and unequivocally dead wrong.'' The plant was built with a 100 percent unionized labor force. <LOCATION> Bloomington </LOCATION> Mayor Smart says the Japanese will be happy they built here. `` When you get into any rural setting, people are not afraid to put in long hours,'' he said. `` Here there's a satisfaction in seeing the end result. You're just bred that way.''

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Market Share: _ Japanese companies increased their share of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market from about 8 percent in 1976 to about 23 percent in 1987. _ An estimated 2.08 million Japanese imports and 737,513 `` transplants'' _ cars built totally or partly by the Japanese at <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sites _ were sold in this country last year. That accounted for 26.6 percent of the 10.52 million cars purchased in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Imports include cars such as the Dodge Colt, built by <ORGANIZATION> Mitsubishi </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. Transplants include products of joint U.S.-Japanese ventures, such as the Ford Probe, built by <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION>. _ The number of transplant autos built in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has risen steadily. The Wefa Group, an economic consulting organization, estimates Japanese transplants in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> will total 1.7 million cars in 1990, compared with 600,000 in 1986.

 Imports: _ <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> exported 2.21 million cars to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in the 1987 fiscal year, which ended last March. The Japanese government said shipments in the April-November period were 10.4 percent below those of a year earlier, but it still estimates <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> will have exported 2.2 million cars to this country when the current fiscal year ends in March. In 1981, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> imposed a voluntary export restraint in response to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> political pressure. It first limited annual exports to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to 1.68 million units. The cap was increased in steps to 2.3 million units in 1985. It has remained there since. Some Japanese automakers feel the quota is outdated because domestic car prices have become more attractive against the cost of Japanese cars, driven upward as the yen doubled in value over the last three years.

 Exports: _ In 1986, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> produced 12.5 million vehicles and exported 40,000. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> produced 12.2 million vehicles, 6.6 million of which were exported.

 Japanese Investment: _ In the 1980s, Japanese automakers have invested $ 5 billion in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> assembly plants for cars and light trucks. _ Seven automakers and more than 100 auto parts suppliers with partial or total Japanese ownership are operating or building plants in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Since 1984, the number of Japanese-affiliated auto suppliers has nearly doubled in this country.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 Job Loss: _ A 1988 <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> report said Japanese-affiliated automakers could cause the loss of 45,000 jobs in the industry in 1990 if there was a high displacement rate -LRB- ` transplant' autos built in lieu of domestic cars -RRB-, a production level of 1.8 million vehicles by those companies and 50 percent of the cars' parts and materials were made in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> compared with 83 percent for traditional <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> automakers. But the <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> said the government underestimated the potential job loss due to transplants. The union said up to 74,000 jobs could be lost. _ The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> estimated a job loss of 360,000 from 1985 to 1990 from all factors, including transplants, gains in productivity, rising auto imports and increased use of foreign parts. However, the <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> estimate was 470,000, noting Japanese-affiliated plants have built only a third of planned capacity. _ From 1985 to 1987, 169,000 auto manufacturing jobs have disappeared. That includes workers at the plants as well as those employed by industry suppliers.

<TEXT>
 Minorities: _ In 1984, according to reports filed with the <ORGANIZATION> Equal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Opportunity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, blacks comprised 17.2 percent of all workers employed by the Big Three automakers and 8.4 percent of white-collar employees. Blacks make up nearly 11 percent of the civilian labor force. _ <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> estimated its 1987 payroll for its black employees was $ 3 billion. The March 1988 Current Population Survey estimated total 1987 wage and salary income for 12.9 million blacks was $ 178.8 billion. So, although <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s black workers represented just six-tenths percent of all black employees, they received 1.7 percent of the nation's black wage and salary income in 1987.

<HEAD>Crop Futures Close Mostly Higher On Rebound, Chinese Wheat Talk</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Grain and soybean futures prices closed mostly higher Wednesday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> in a technical rebound from two days of steep losses in the corn and soybean markets, analysts said. Wheat futures rallied strongly late in the session on rumors <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> was seeking to buy or had bought 750,000 metric tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat for delivery this summer. `` I would n't be surprised if it turned out to be true,'' said <PERSON> Katharina </PERSON> <PERSON> Zimmer </PERSON>, a grain-market analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Markets </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The rally mainly affected the new-crop wheat contracts, those for delivery of wheat that has not yet been harvested. New-crop corn and soybean futures also posted sharper gains than the contracts for near-month delivery. Analysts said the pattern reflected growing concerns about potential weather problems that could affect this year's crops. At the close, wheat was 2 cents to 6 -LCB- higher with the contract for delivery in March at $ 4.39 -RCB- a bushel; corn was 2 -LCB- cents to 6 cents higher with March at $ 2.70 -LCB- a bushel; oats were 3 cents to 5 cents higher with March at $ 2.38 a bushel; soybeans were -RCB- cent lower to 9 cents higher with March at $ 7.70 a bushel.

 They're super-swift high-tech superstars that can do anything from design nuclear warheads to build a better yacht. Supercomputers are used by the government, the military, universities and Fortune 500 companies to help crack codes, forecast weather, design aircraft, conduct geological exploration or simulate the effects of nuclear explosions. `` The supercomputer is important economically and socially,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Patton </PERSON>, a computer consultant in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>. `` They're used in everything from the mundane to the sublime _ designing appliances ... to developing new life-saving techniques and surgery. That range, he said, can help shape <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s role in the world economy. `` The whole name of the game is competitive advantage in the international market,'' said <PERSON> Patton </PERSON>, director of technology assessment at the <ORGANIZATION> Super </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Performance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dataquest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a marketing-forecasting firm. `` The key to maintaining that competitive advantage is faster design, reduced government certification time, better testing.'' The two major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> supercomputer companies are <ORGANIZATION> Cray </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> ETA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Its competition: three Japanese computer giants _ <ORGANIZATION> Fujitsu </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Hitachi </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> NEC </ORGANIZATION> There also are about three dozen smaller, so-called `` mini-supercomputer'' companies in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Patton </PERSON> said. Some experts believe the Japanese are threatening <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s dominance of the industry `` We opened a very large lead and we no longer have that large lead,'' <PERSON> Patton </PERSON> said. One of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s main advantages, he said, is it has the `` lion's share of semiconductor -LRB- computer chips -RRB- market We gave up on the semiconductor industry.'' But other experts say it's too early to talk of the Japanese overtaking the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` Even though <ORGANIZATION> Cray </ORGANIZATION> machines use a lot of Japanese components, I do n't think it's fair to say they're ahead in any way, shape or form,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Burwen </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Palo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, a consulting firm. `` There are a lot of people who say the Japanese are a very big threat to supercomputers,'' he said. `` I do n't think the evidence is in. The Japanese certainly have not been able to demonstrate they can penetrate anything outside their home market in this business.'' About 350 supercomputers have been installed worldwide. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> customers include <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alamos </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION>, location of the first <ORGANIZATION> Cray </ORGANIZATION>, introduced in 1976. Supercomputers can do billions of calculations a second. For example, a Bible concordance _ an alphabetical referencing by word _ that took a scholar 17 years to do in the mid-1700s and required 1,000 hours on a computer in 1956 can be done on a <ORGANIZATION> Cray </ORGANIZATION> supercomputer in 20 seconds, <PERSON> Patton </PERSON> said. Although experts sometimes disagree on what a supercomputer is, it generally is described as the fastest, largest, most expensive machine at any time _ one that can do problems others ca n't. <PERSON> Burwen </PERSON> also said 44 percent of all supercomputers are in private industry, 37 percent in government installations, and 19 percent in universities. Nowadays, supercomputers are changing industry, because products `` can not only be designed and prototyped on screen, but be tested and evaluated ... and have complete data performance before you touch tool to steel,'' he said. Automakers, for one, `` can do a design in six months instead of 18 months,'' he said. `` You can literally take years off the design cycle.'' Supercomputers have also begun to simulate crash testing for autos. And oil companies use supercomputers to get the best production in petroleum exploration. `` If they get 1 percent -LRB- more oil -RRB- out of a reservoir, it pays for itself 100 times over,'' <PERSON> Patton </PERSON> said. `` What if it's a $ 10 million computer if you get $ 20 billion -LRB- more oil -RRB- out of a reservoir?'' Among <ORGANIZATION> Cray </ORGANIZATION>'s customers are <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s Big Three automakers, <ORGANIZATION> Volkswagen </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Fiat </ORGANIZATION> and petroleum giants such as <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Chevron </ORGANIZATION>. A <ORGANIZATION> Cray </ORGANIZATION> supercomputer also was used to help design Stars & amp; Stripes, the yacht <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Conner </PERSON> sailed in 1987 when he won the <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s Cup. Two competing syndicates also used Cray technology, said company spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Swenson </PERSON>. Scientists designing supercomputers are toiling in an industry constantly trying to produce faster machines. <ORGANIZATION> Cray </ORGANIZATION> plans to have a new supercomputer ready this year or next, and it's expected to be 100 times faster than his original machine. In 1992-94, he hopes to produce the Cray-4, 1,000 times more powerful. And, <PERSON> Swenson </PERSON> said, that wo n't be the end. As he explained, `` We still do n't see the limit.''

 The <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> shoreline of <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> is home to the nation's steel giants. And perhaps no Rust Belt city better typifies a steel town than <PERSON> Gary </PERSON>. The steel slump of the'80s hit hard in <LOCATION> Gary </LOCATION>, already struggling with crime, decay and a declining tax base. But steel is making a comeback and <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> hopes it can, too. The third story of a four-part series, `` The Changing Heartland,'' looks at the resurgence in <LOCATION> Gary </LOCATION> and northwestern <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>.

 This steel town has long been a four-letter word for all that's gone wrong in industrial <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>: a shrinking workforce, sooty skies, a sorry future. With the city's fate tied to steel's fortunes, when the industry hurts, so does <PERSON> Gary </PERSON>. Now that steel is surging, this archetypal Rust Belt city says it is on the mend, too. Unemployment is down, companies are moving in, real estate is being snatched up. More importantly, <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> is looking beyond steel _ a lakefront marina is planned and an airport project is being pushed. `` We're on an upturn now,'' said Mayor <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON>. `` The optimism we feel is not because we've resolved the problems that exist. It's because we're right now on a track to resolving them. There's growth as opposed to further decline. People are taking another look at <PERSON> Gary </PERSON>.'' They will still find a depressed city _ shuttered stores, gutted homes and a bleak downtown with no hotel or department store. But there also is new prosperity due, in part, to a leaner, profitable steel industry that's been boosted by increasing demand, import limits, the low dollar and new technology. After losses of almost $ 12 billion in 1982-86, the industry nationwide earned $ 1 billion in 1987 and is expected to double that for 1988. That improvement has contributed to an upturn in <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> and other parts of northwestern <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, site of the world's greatest concentration of steel-making capacity. For example: _ Five steel companies in <LOCATION> Porter </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> counties, the latter including <PERSON> Gary </PERSON>, have spent more than $ 2.5 billion on their facilities since 1982, said the <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> is <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s No. 1 steel producer; 22 percent of the nation's steel is made there. The industry pumps almost $ 20 million daily into <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>'s economy. _ Unemployment in the <LOCATION> Gary-Hammond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, area fell from 15.7 percent in 1982-83 to 9.5 percent in 1987; the 1987 numbers would have been lower but for a six-month walkout at USS Gary Works, the city's biggest employer and flagship of <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. November's unemployment rate was 6.1 percent; 1988 was the first year this decade without double-digit employment in any month Those figures, however, do not reflect huge population losses. The area's labor force shrunk by 38,100 from 1980 to November 1988 _ New and expanding businesses in the <LOCATION> Gary </LOCATION> area have filled 12.4 million square feet of industrial space and created almost 6,500 jobs since 1984. Much of the growth is steel-related. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> `` is one of the best heavy industrial locations in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Gates </PERSON>, an investor and redeveloper. `` You're close to all the major manufacturers in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> Most of these peoples' customers are nearby. You've got very inexpensive rents and real estate costs. `` If someone needs steel, you're going to be near the biggest and cheapest source of supply nationwide,'' added <PERSON> Gates </PERSON>, who has helped 24 companies, some from <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, expand or settle in the area. The new-and-improved status may even be reflected in a 1988 Money magazine survey that ranked the <LOCATION> Gary-Hammond </LOCATION> area 41st among 300 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> living spots _ two slots above considerably more picturesque <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> and up from 92nd place a year earlier. That might seem surprising, considering <PERSON> Gary </PERSON>'s reputation as aging, crime-infested and polluted. City planner <PERSON> Taghi </PERSON> <PERSON> Arshami </PERSON> says that's more myth than reality, though he concedes <PERSON> Gary </PERSON>'s center section, with a vacancy rate equal to 20 acres, is devastated. `` The problem we have generally for downtown is lack of investment, lack of confidence on the part of business and on the part of banks that are not willing to put the money down,'' he said. But he is optimistic about developing <PERSON> Gary </PERSON>'s downtown into a public and service sector hub, noting that 12,000 people work there. Some of <PERSON> Gary </PERSON>'s image problems stem from lean times of the last decade. Jobs and people disappeared, unemployment soared. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON>'s population, now about 137,000, fell 10 percent from 1980 to 1986 Even now, experts say, growth in northwestern <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> is occurring in rural areas. The mills shrank, too, while becoming more efficient. Northwestern <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> now has 35,300 steelworkers, a 47 percent drop from 1979. USS Gary Works has 7,500 workers, compared with 21,000-22 ,000 in the late 1970s Although mill investments spur related business, some say <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> is in a precarious position because it remains so dependent on steel. `` The danger of <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> is not that they are n't doing fairly well,'' said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Cassell </PERSON>, professor emeritus of industrial relations at <ORGANIZATION> Northwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` -LRB- But -RRB- they're likely to delude themselves into thinking that what they're doing is the most powerful influence.'' Instead, he said, bigger factors are external _ demand, the dollar and the nation's economy. `` <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> is doing good work for itself. That's commendable,'' he said. `` -LRB- But -RRB- one does n't want to think that's the whole picture.'' Some business leaders concede the region has done a poor job of diversifying, but others point to such changes as the growth of the health industry, which provides 20,400 jobs in the area. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> is also touting recreation. Promotional brochures feature the <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dunes </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, photos of children bicycling along the beach, a golden sunset over shimmering waters and a local boy who made good _ <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. `` We have one of the largest fresh water bodies anywhere in the world,'' <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON> said. `` We have far from taken full advantage of it.'' <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> hopes to rectify that with an ambitious $ 150 - $ 200 million, 1,400-slip marina adjacent to the USS site that could eventually include a hotel, shopping center and amphitheater Officials hope to build the first 250 slips this year. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> also hopes to have the third commercial airport in the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> area. Its present airport provides only charter and private corporate service. An expanded airport would relieve congestion at <ORGANIZATION> O'Hare </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> and Midway in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. One report said it would attract 6.5 million passengers to <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> annually and create 122,000 jobs with a payroll of $ 1.6 billion. Though these projects are critical, <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON> said the city also has `` a much healthier manner of looking at problems,'' whether it's cleaning up illegal dumps or addressing housing needs `` There's already a renewed spirit of cooperation that has n't existed in 20 years,'' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, transportation planner for the <ORGANIZATION> Northwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Planning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> `` People,'' he said, `` feel a lot more confident about <PERSON> Gary </PERSON>'s future.

 Here are some facts about the steel industry, provided by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Iron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. They represent reports from 25 companies representing 80 percent of the industry. _ Profits-Losses: The nation's steel industry is expected to post a 1988 profit of about $ 2 billion. In 1987, profits were $ 1.02 billion, following losses of almost $ 12 billion in 1982-86. The rising profits are attributed to a general strengthening in the world steel market and a moderate increase in demand. _ Shipments: Domestic steel mill shipments are estimated to have risen from 76.7 million tons in 1987 to about 83 million tons in 1988 _ an 8.2 percent increase. _ Production: Raw steel production jumped from 89.2 million tons in 1987 to almost 100 million tons in 1988 _ a 12 percent increase. _ Employment: Average industry employment in 1988 was 170,000, slightly above the 1987 average of 163,000, the lowest since the institute started keeping records in 1933. The industry posted a record-high employment of 650,200 in 1953. _ Imports: Imports in 1988 will have accounted for about 20.5 percent of the steel shipped to consumers, compared with 20.9 percent in 1987. Imports reached a high of 26.4 percent in 1984, the year when the Voluntary Restraint Agreements set a goal of reducing imports to 20.2 percent of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market. The agreement expires this year. _ State Production: <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> leads the nation in steel production, with about 22 percent of the steel made there. <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> accounts for 18 percent and <ORGANIZATION> Pennsylvania </ORGANIZATION> 13 percent.

 The stock market pushed ahead toward new post-crash highs today, shrugging off what analysts described as mildly disappointing news on international trade. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 13.75 to 2,228.39 by 3 p.m. on Wall Street. The average reached its highest close since October 1987 at 2,226.07 last Friday. Gainers outnumbered losers by about 9 to 5 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed issues, with 935 up, 513 down and 497 unchanged. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported this morning that the nation's trade deficit widened to $ 12.51 billion in November from a revised $ 10.26 billion the month before The latest number exceeded most advance estimates on Wall Street, although analysts said it caused no great dismay among traders. The news had only a short-lived impact on the markets. The dollar and bond prices quickly rebounded from it, and as they moved higher stocks followed their lead. Meanwhile, the market also absorbed the news of quarterly earnings from <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> that fell slightly short of expectations. <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>, which posted profits of $ 3.97 a share for the fourth quarter against $ 3.47 in the like period a year earlier, was down -LRB- at 123 -RCB-. <ORGANIZATION> Tandem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computers </ORGANIZATION> jumped 1 -LCB- to 18 -LRB- and led the active list. The company reported earnings for its first fiscal quarter ended Dec. 31 of 32 cents a share, up from 24 cents in the like period a year earlier. <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> slipped -LRB- to 95 -LRB- in active trading. <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roberts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said it had lined up more than $ 14 billion in bank loans to help finance its buyout of the company. The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>'s composite index of all its listed common stocks rose .99 to 160.47. At the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the market value index was up .59 at 317.16. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 147.87 million shares with an hour to go.

 When <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Keitel </PERSON> returned from a life abroad two years ago, he yearned to settle on the soil he once called home. He was ready for <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, but <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> was n't ready for him. Jobs were scarce. So was optimism. People were moving out, merchants were following. But over time, misery has given way to mending. <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, a state that once typified the decline and despair of rural <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, is on the rebound. Consider <PERSON> Keitel </PERSON>, an <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> native who returned to a state thousands fled, found work where two years ago there was none, and is praising a land that not long ago was pitied. `` I think this place is a gold mine,'' says <PERSON> Keitel </PERSON>, a 36-year-old engineer who grew up on an eastern <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> farm. `` The <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> economy is coming on strong,'' boasts Gov. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Branstad </PERSON>. `` We know we still have a long way to go, but we've come a long ways.'' Unemployment is down, revenues are up and there's a sense the worst is over. Some claim a bust-to-boom assessment is too rosy and premature, but the declining dollar, export opportunities, price supports and a diversifying economy have contributed to a turnaround. Consider: _ The value of <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> farmland rose 20.4 percent in 1988, prompting the Des Moines Register headline `` <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> Dirt Turns to Gold Again.'' The increase, reported in an <ORGANIZATION> Iowa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> study, was the largest since the mid-1970s. From 1981 to 1986, land values had plummeted 63 percent. _ <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>'s labor force reached an all-time high in October: 1.5 million people working or seeking jobs. Unemployment was 3.5 percent, the lowest since November 1979. In some areas, jobs outnumber residents. Mount Pleasant has about 5,000 people of working age but almost 12,000 jobs. <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> soon plans to set up a nationwide toll-free number to lure back ex-Iowans who left in search of work. _ <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> is expected to have a $ 180 million budget surplus in the 1989 and 1990 fiscal years, a panel of financial experts said in December, although some of that will likely be eaten up with federal mandates. _ One in five <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> farmers has substantial money troubles, down from one in three in 1984-85, said <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Harl </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> Iowa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> economics professor. _ <ORGANIZATION> Deere </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the state's largest private employer with 14,800 workers, posted record fourth-quarter and year-end earnings. _ After six years in which <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> lost almost 100,000 people, the <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> reported last month state population increased by 11,000 from 1987 to 1988. Despite such numbers, some say last summer's drought will have a lingering impact. They also worry the state's upturn is bypassing rural areas where schools have closed, young people have departed and Main Street merchants have closed up shop. `` We have n't turned the corner yet by any means,'' said <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Ostendorf </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Prairiefire </LOCATION>, a rural advocacy group. `` Many of the rural counties still have poverty rates exceeding 20 percent.'' <PERSON> Branstad </PERSON> says, though, that no state enjoys `` uniform prosperity. What we want to do is help those areas that are n't doing as well to help themselves.'' The state uses lottery proceeds, for instance, for economic development, some of the money going for loans, aid to local communities or research projects. Already, the upswing and growth in the meat packing and farm equipment industries have helped hard-hit blue-collar areas. In <LOCATION> Waterloo </LOCATION>, unemployment fell from 8.8 percent last January to 4.3 percent in November. `` People feel we've bottomed out,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Waterloo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Deere </PERSON>, which has a giant local operation, has recalled workers; a leather processing plant recently opened, and a new <ORGANIZATION> IBP </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> hog slaughtering plant is being built, <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> said. In <LOCATION> Mason </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, about 1,500 new jobs, many of them service sector and health-related, will be created in 1989 alone, compared with about 2,000 in the last five years combined, said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Jolas </PERSON>, an economic development consultant to the city. <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>'s recovery is due, in part, to a declining dollar that makes grain and other products more competitive on the world market, said state economist <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> Siegelman </PERSON>. `` There will be Winnebagos going to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, beef to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Deere </PERSON> tractors all over the world,'' he said. Just as critical is <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>'s effort to reduce its reliance on agriculture. `` The key to success is diversification,'' <PERSON> Branstad </PERSON> said. `` Some of it actually is building off the agricultural economy that already exists and finding new uses for products.'' <PERSON> Branstad </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> has also targeted several industries for development: telecommunications, biotechnology, pharmaceuticals and insurance. <PERSON> Des </PERSON> <PERSON> Moines </PERSON> already is an insurance capital. <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pleasant </LOCATION>, 28 miles from the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, learned to diversify decades ago. It's paid off. The town's business roster includes such corporate names as <ORGANIZATION> Motorola </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Cargill </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Goodyear </ORGANIZATION>. A <ORGANIZATION> Wal-Mart </ORGANIZATION> distribution center opened in 1985. Mount Pleasant is also home to a large fireplace maker, a bulk mail distributor that claims more outgoing postage volume than <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>, and a school bus manufacturer. `` We set an example of how we can control our own future,'' said <PERSON> Glenda </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON>, the local chamber's vice president. `` We appreciate the help of the state and federal government, but we will not sit back and depend on them.'' Mount Pleasant never hit the depths some <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> communities sank to in the mid-1980s, though the county unemployment rate was 8.1 percent in 1982-83. In November, it was 2.5 percent. In the last six months, two motels, four stores and a truck stop have opened. Officials say property values rose from $ 45 million to $ 130 million in the last decade; retail sales jumped 18.7 percent from March 1986 to March 1988. Mount Pleasant has also held onto its young people, offering jobs involving computers and lasers. `` There is n't a small town in the state of <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> that has any more sophisticated industry than we have,'' said Mayor <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Vilsack </PERSON>. <PERSON> Keitel </PERSON> returned from <LOCATION> Saudia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> in 1986, ending up as an engineer in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> when he could n't find work in <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>. Last fall he found a job in <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pleasant </LOCATION>. `` <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> still has a lot to offer, even with all of its problems,'' he said. `` We have n't lost our sense of values.

 <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> introduced what it called `` the industry's first true desktop mainframe,'' a personal computer that has a special circuit board with all the features of its big mainframe computers.

It can can run either standard personal computer programs or programs written for its big A series of mainframes, <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> said. <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> used advanced chip-packing techniques to get mainframe features onto a board small enough to fit into a single slot in one of its standard PW2 personal computers.

<HEAD>Survey Says 17 Percent of Biggest US Firms Wooed by Foreigners in

<TEXT>
 Foreign firms made takeover overtures to 17 percent of the largest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies last year but only a handful of the approaches grew into a formal buyout bid, according to a survey released Wednesday. The survey by <ORGANIZATION> Northwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Kellogg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Graduate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> also found that about two-thirds of the 95 chief executives who participated said they were more interested in joint ventures with foreign companies than they were in selling out. The findings were based on a survey of the chief executive officers of 95 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corporations with annual sales of at least $ 1 billion. Northwestern Professor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Zajac </PERSON>, project director for the survey, said he was surprised by the number of firms that reported overtures by foreign companies. `` Look at our sample _ those firms are very large,'' <PERSON> Zajac </PERSON> said in a telephone interview from his office in <LOCATION> Evanston </LOCATION>. `` To say that 17 percent of Fortune 500 and <ORGANIZATION> Forbes </ORGANIZATION> 500 companies have been approached, that's a healthy number.'' But <PERSON> Ian </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON>, managing director of <ORGANIZATION> Samuel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Montagu </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the New York-based investment-banking unit of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Midland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, was unimpressed with the survey results. `` It surprises me that it's as low as it is,'' <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON> said, citing the takeovers by British firms last year of such notable <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies as <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Farmers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Macmillan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` It does n't surprise me at all that 17 of the 95 had been contacted,'' said <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON>, whose firm assisted in <ORGANIZATION> Maxwell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communication </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s buyout of <LOCATION> Macmillan </LOCATION>. Twenty-three percent of the survey respondents said they had been approached about a prospective buyout by a domestic company. The survey did not attempt to identify the nationalities of the foreign companies that made takeover overtures for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> firms. But a report released Tuesday by the <ORGANIZATION> Translink </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, an investment banking firm, said British companies went on a record $ 32.5 billion spending spree in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> last year, buying 398 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies. Japanese companies spent $ 12.7 billion on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> acquisitions in 1988, according to the quarterly British-American Deal Review, which is published by <PERSON> Translink </PERSON>. The Northwestern survey also found that while 60 percent of the respondents felt foreign ownership tends to maximize shareholder value, just over half said they would prefer a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> firm as a new owner if they were taken over. Only 5.7 percent of the CEOs expressed a preference for foreign ownership. Sixty-four percent of the companies surveyed said they were involved with foreign allies in `` strategic alliances'' that ranged from joint ventures and licensing agreements to co-marketing agreements. `` I think that really shows how firms are adjusting to the new global economy,'' <PERSON> Zajac </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>SEC Wants Drexel's Junk Bond Operation Moved to New York</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICK GLADSTONE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the investment powerhouse that has agreed to plead guilty to fraud, is grappling with a potentially crippling government demand to transplant its lucrative and freewheeling high-yield `` junk bond'' operation from <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Sources familiar with negotiations between <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> and federal authorities, speaking on condition of anonymity, confirmed reports Wednesday that the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> has added that condition as a basis for settling outstanding civil litigation against <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>. Making peace with the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> is crucial for finalizing <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>'s record plea bargain deal reached last month with the <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's office on related criminal charges Under that arrangement, the firm agreed to plead guilty to six felonies and pay $ 650 million in fines and restitution, largely stemming from its dealings with <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>, the inside trader now serving a three-year prison term. A deadline for <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> to settle with the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> passed a week ago, but the sources said both sides informally agreed to stop the clock in order to complete their negotiations. It was unclear why the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> added the new condition regarding <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>'s junk bond unit, a highly autonomous operation based in <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> reportedly had asked earlier that only supervisory authority over the operation be transferred to <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> headquarters The junk bond unit is said to be the major source of profit for the nation's fifth-biggest securities firm. <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> McCue </PERSON> declined to comment on the <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> negotiations, in accordance with the commission's policy regarding impending enforcement matters. <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Anreder </PERSON> also declined to comment on the negotiations but suggested a relocation of the junk bond unit could be ruinous. <PERSON> Anreder </PERSON> said the firm `` does not believe the high-yield bond department can be successfully moved to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> since any effort to do so would destroy the department and do irreparable damage to the high-yield market.'' Despite its lengthy legal ordeal stemming from the <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> scandal, <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> remains a leader in selling and dealing junk bonds, which are low-grade, high-interest securities used mainly to finance takeovers and the growth of small and medium size companies. <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> helped parlay junk bonds into a $ 175 billion market. The new <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> demand came at a time when many <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> high-yield bond traders already are upset over the firm's decision to bargain with the government rather than fight fraud accusations that stemmed from <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>'s disclosures when he was exposed in late 1986. <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> chief executive <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> visited the operation last week in attempt to ease tension there. But if <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> were forced to relocate the junk bond unit to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, many disaffected traders might quit, throwing the business into chaos. The operation was moved from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> in 1978 by its architect <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>, a senior <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> financier who is expected to be indicted on securities fraud and other charges. Unlike <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> has continued asserting his innocence but has been under intensifying pressure to negotiate a plea bargain.

<HEAD>EPA Still Hopes To Move On Gas Vapor Pollution Regulation</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday it still hoped to move further before the end of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration toward a regulation requiring larger gasoline vapor recovery canisters on cars. The agency's proposed regulation, and a companion rule requring refiners to lower the volatility of gasoline, has been held up by the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> since October on safety grounds. A trade publication, Inside <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>, reported last week that <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyden </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, counsel to President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, had asked <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> administrator, to take no action on the canister rule but to adopt the volatility rule. `` We are still hopeful that some type of agreement can be made that would allow us to take the next step procedurally,'' <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> said Wednesday. Gasoline vapors are a principal source of urban smog, and the trend in recent years toward higher volatility gasoline has increased vapor emissions over <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> expectations. Several northeastern states recently adopted regulations of their own requiring refiners to lower volatility. Existing small canisters on cars are designed to recover vapors only while the car is running or parked, not the large amounts emitted during refueling. Recent <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> research has shown the higher-volatility fuel used today can overhelm the capacity of current canisters when running in hot weather. EPA estimates its canister and volatility rules together would reduce emissions of ozone-forming compounds by up to 30 percent in some areas. The Office of Management and Budget, the auto industry and Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON>, D-Mich., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and a staunch guardian of the auto industry's interests, all have objected that <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s plan would increase the fire risk in crashes A report from the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Traffic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> said unresolved safety questions remain; <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s consultants have said the risk would be reduced When it published the draft canister rule for public comment, <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> acknowledged it would have to seek public comment again on the <ORGANIZATION> NHTSA </ORGANIZATION> report. In his comment Wednesday, <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> was referring to that second solicitation of comment. That would not require the agency to go ahead with the volatility standard alone. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>' successor, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON>, has expressed no opinion on the issue. He could revoke any action <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> took, but such revocations are bureaucratically as complicated as the issuance of a new regulation. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> has been convinced for more than a year that the gasoline volatility rule, opposed by the oil industry, and the canister rule, favored by the oil industry, must be adopted together to keep the industry mollified if not satisfied. If the canister rule is not adopted, there is a risk that the entire issue of gasoline vapor emissions during refueling would be thrown back to where it was when it started 10 years ago, pitting the oil and auto industries against each other. The alternative to a canister rule is a requirement for vapor-recovering hoses at service stations, already used in the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> and parts of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and coming into use in parts of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> area. The oil industry opposes these because it costs several thousand dollars to eequip each stations. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> believes the larger canister on the car is the better way to reduce vapors because monitoring compliance among two dozen or so manufacturers and importers on the device is easier than checking tens of thousands of gasoline stations using the dual-hose systems.

 Car thieves love Camaros. The autos made by <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s Chevrolet Division were the four most-stolen cars last year, according to a list compiled by an automobile valuation service in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. In fact, thieves picked <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> cars as their 22 most-popular targets, according to the list developed by <ORGANIZATION> CCC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a business used by insurance companies to determine the value of a stolen car. The 1986 Chevrolet Camaro topped the CCC list of stolen cars for the second consecutive year. This year's list, based on 1988 car thefts, has the'87 Camaro as No. 2; the'84 Camaro following that, and the'85 Camaro as No. 4. The top five was rounded out by the 1981 <ORGANIZATION> Oldsmobile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cutlass </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION>. `` It -LRB- the Camaro -RRB- appears as popular with thieves as with lawful owners,'' said <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON>, a spokesman for the Chevrolet Division. `` That car is extremely popular and if you think of a huge percentage of auto thefts being joy-ride kinds of things, the people who tend to go joy riding tend to do so in Camaros.'' The most popular imported car among thieves last year was the 1987 <ORGANIZATION> Hyundai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Excel </ORGANIZATION>, made in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. It was followed on the import list by the 1985 Mazda RX7 GT, and the'83,'81 and'82 Toyota Corolla, all made in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. Of the 111,440 nationwide insurance claims handled by CCC, there were reports of 1,006 thefts of'86 Camaros, making up 0.9 percent of all the stolen cars. There were 780 thefts of'87 Camaros; 748 thefts of'84 Camaros and 673 thefts of'85 Camaros. The'87 Hyundai Excel wound up No. 23 on the overall list, following nearly two dozen <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> cars. Automobiles made by <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> accounted for 76 of the top 100, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> had four cars on the list, <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> had none and imported brands had 20. The first non-GM, U.S.-made car on the list is the 1985 <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Escort </ORGANIZATION>, holding down spot No. 45. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> cars make up about 50 percent of those on the road today, said company spokesman <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Hudgens </PERSON>. <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON> said the company has taken note of the high theft rate of some of its cars and is fighting it. `` I think the VATS system is going to make it a whole lot more difficult to steal a car,'' he said. VATS, for vehicle anti-theft system, was introduced on the Corvette and now is being used on Camaros and Firebirds, <PERSON> Kramer </PERSON> said. CCC provides an information database for insurance companies to settle theft and collision claims. CCC said the insurance companies with which it deals with represent 75 percent of all automobile property and casualty insurance in force.

<HEAD>Japan's Trade Surplus Narrows in 1988, But Was Widening in Recent
Months</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> said Wednesday its surplus of exports over imports surged in December to a monthly record, despite official assurances that the <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> economic giant is moving forcefully to open markets to foreign goods. Although the <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said the surplus shrank for all of 1988, figures showed it was widening in the last four months of the year, capped by the $ 9.65 billion imbalance recorded last month. The <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>'s announcement coincided with news from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> that the trade deficit of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s most important trading partner, ballooned to $ 12.5 billion in November, the biggest imbalance in five months. Taken together, the figures suggested that simmering U.S.-Japanese disputes could worsen over restricted <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> access to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s markets, and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s exploitation of the American marketplace. For all of 1988, the <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> reported, the surplus totaled $ 77.39 billion, down from $ 79.71 billion in 1987. But the figure was overshadowed by the December surplus, which compared with an $ 8.61 billion surplus a year earlier and $ 6.56 billion surplus in November. It was the fourth straight month that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s surplus exceeded that of the corresponding month in 1987. `` We hear the voices of concern, and we have concern,'' <PERSON> Mitoji </PERSON> <PERSON> Yabunaka </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Second </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Division </ORGANIZATION>, said at a news conference. `` But at the same time, we see encouraging trends.'' <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s major trading partners have been pressing it for years to take greater steps toward reducing its huge trade surpluses by opening Japanese markets to greater competition from abroad. The <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said exports totaled $ 264.87 billion in 1988, up 15.6 percent from the previous year, while imports climbed 25.4 percent to $ 187.47 billion. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s December exports grew 11.6 percent from a year earlier to $ 26.08 billion while imports grew 11.3 percent to $ 16.43 billion. With the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s 1988 surplus totaled $ 47.61 billion, down from $ 52.10 billion in 1987. But the December surplus with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> totaled $ 5.03 billion, up from $ 4.92 billion in the previous December. Lower prices for crude oil, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s most important import, coupled with strong demand overseas for Japanese-made computers, semiconductors and automobiles contributed to the record December figure. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> ran a $ 22.8 billion surplus with the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> in 1988, up from $ 20.02 billion in 1987. In December, the surplus totaled $ 2.15 billion, up from $ 1.92 billion a year earlier. For fiscal 1988, which ends March 31, <PERSON> Yabunaka </PERSON> stressed that the projected 23.4 percent increase in imports is better than initially expected and shows <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> is `` on the right track.'' In fiscal 1989, the government sees imports growing by 17.4 percent compared with 9.4 percent for exports. <PERSON> Yabunaka </PERSON> attributed the 13.5 percent growth in fiscal 1988 exports to the strong world economic performance in general, and added: `` There will be a moderate growth in exports over the course of the next -LRB- fiscal -RRB- year, but we expect the speed to slow down due to a slowing in the world economy.''

 <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday its quarterly earnings rose 12.4 percent, a gain that appeared to reflect the improving health of the computer industry in general. Some analysts predicted that in 1989 <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> would approach and maybe surpass its record profits of 1984, the year before a computer industry slump that produced the first back-to-back earnings declines in <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> history. ``'87 and'88 were kind of recovery years. Maybe'89 is when we're going to break the all-time records,'' said <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION> SoundView </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Stamford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, who is bullish on <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> stock. Makers of big mainframe computers and engineering workstations are generally doing well while personal computer makers are muddling along, although results for individual companies vary widely. <ORGANIZATION> Tandy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a personal computer maker, reported a narrow 3 percent gain in profit Wednesday. <ORGANIZATION> Wang </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a minicomputer maker that has struggled in recent years, said its earnings tumbled 97 percent. <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>, the world's largest computer company, said its profits were helped by increased efficiency and positive response by customers `` in every segment of our business.'' The <LOCATION> Armonk </LOCATION>, N.Y.-based company also announced it had trimmed its staff even more than expected through voluntary separation incentives. The company's stock rose $ 1.12 -LCB- to $ 125 a share in consolidated <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> trading. It had dropped as much as $ 1.75 a share right after the announcement but soon recovered. The pressure on <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>'s stock came mainly from the company's statements to analysts that its tax rate in 1989 would be higher than in 1988, depressing net income, <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> and others said <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> said it earned $ 2.35 billion, or $ 3.97 a share, up from $ 2.09 billion, or $ 3.47 a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose to $ 20 billion from $ 18.3 billion in the 1987 period. For all of 1988, <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> said its earnings rose 10.4 percent to $ 5.81 billion, or $ 9.80 a share, from $ 5.26 billion, or $ 8.72 a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 8 percent to $ 59.7 billion from $ 55.3 billion. <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> said it recorded a fourth-quarter gain of $ 220 million on payments from <ORGANIZATION> Fujitsu </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, its Japanese rival, under an arbitration order that ended a software copyright dispute. But that gain was more than offset by a charge of $ 270 million to cover unexpected costs of consolidating its operations. The company said 6,500 employees had chosen to leave the company under a voluntary separation incentive program, more than the 3,000 to 4,000 that the company had expected when it announced the incentives in June as part of a $ 600 million consolidation program. The separation offer was made to some manufacturing and headquarters employees. <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Marti </PERSON> <PERSON> Mattia </PERSON> said it had been especially popular with heaquarters employees. <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, an analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Witter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said of <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>'s results, `` It was a good quarter.'' `` Some hot money moved in to anticipate a better-than-expected quarter'' and moved out when the hopes failed to materialize, he said, explaining the stock drop. `` The <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> company is continuing to show improvement in our product line, our relationships with our customers and our financial performance,'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Akers </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>'s chairman and chief executive, said in a statement. <ORGANIZATION> Wang </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Lowell </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, said its earnings fell to $ 1 million, or 1 cent per share, in its second fiscal quarter, from $ 34.1 million, or 21 cents a share, a year earlier. The office-automation company said revenue fell to $ 760.7 million from $ 784.7 million a year earlier. <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> said its earnings for the six months ended Dec. 31 were $ 14.1 million, or 9 cents a share, down from $ 56.6 million, or 34 cents a share, a year earlier. Revenue edged up to $ 1.483 billion from $ 1.477 billion a year earlier. <ORGANIZATION> Tandy </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, said its second-quarter earnings rose to $ 135.1 million, or $ 1.50 a share, from $ 130.8 million, or $ 1.46 a share, a year earlier. Revenue rose 8 percent to $ 1.4 billion from $ 1.3 billion. For the first six months of its fiscal year, <ORGANIZATION> Tandy </ORGANIZATION> said its earnings rose 2.5 percent to $ 200 million, or $ 2.23 a share, from $ 195 million, or $ 2.17 a share. Revenue rose 9.2 percent to $ 2.34 billion from $ 2.14 billion.

<HEAD>Livestock Futures Break Under Weight Of Supplies</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Livestock futures prices plunged Wednesday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> as the combined weight of the corn market's recent collapse and large supplies of frozen pork bellies broke the cattle and hog markets Elsewhere on Wednesday, grain and soybean futures rebounded; oil futures surged; precious metals retreated; and stock-index futures advanced. On the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, live cattle settled .25 cent to 1.35 cents lower with the contract for delivery in February at 73.32 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .90 cent to 1.35 cents lower with January at 84.47 cents a pound; live hogs were 1.32 cents lower to .10 cent higher with February at 43.60 cents a pound; and frozen pork bellies were .45 cent to 1.78 cent lower with February at 40.55 cents a pound. `` I feel like the market's decided to stop selling the grains and sell livestock for a change,'' said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Hare </PERSON>, a livestock-market analyst with Chicago-based <ORGANIZATION> Linnco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. That was a facetious reference to steep declines in corn and soybean futures prices Monday and Tuesday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> following an <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> crop report that showed larger-than-expected supplies of those commodities But another analyst said it was no exaggeration that the grain sell-off had spilled over into the livestock markets. `` I think it started on the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> after the grain report last week,'' said <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Levitt </PERSON>, senior livestock analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. `` With corn down and beans down, it kind of created a negative overall psychology in the agriculture sector.'' Analysts said another factor may have been this week's sluggish pork demand, which contradicts normal seasonal trends. <PERSON> Levitt </PERSON> said the slowdown redirected traders' attention to the nation's growing supply of frozen pork bellies. The <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> reported after the close that supplies in out-of-town warehouses had increased by 736,000 pounds during the week that ended Saturday. `` January is supposed to be an out month for bellies, but we're not getting withdrawals on a net basis,'' <PERSON> Levitt </PERSON> said With no bullish news to support the cattle market, prices dropped below 3 - and 4-week lows, triggering a flood of sell orders from speculators who had been holding out higher prices Many experts have predicted that live cattle futures will rise to record highs above 80 cents a pound by spring. `` The well-publicized bull markets are often most vulnerable to a break, and there were tremendous bullish expectations for the cattle markets,'' <PERSON> Hare </PERSON> said. Corn and soybean futures rebounded on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> in a largely technical correction from the losses of the previous two sessions, analysts said. And wheat futures rallied strongly late in the session on rumors that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> was seeking to buy or had bought 750,000 metric tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat for delivery this summer. `` I would n't be surprised if it turned out to be true,'' said <PERSON> Katharina </PERSON> <PERSON> Zimmer </PERSON>, a grain-market analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Markets </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. Wheat settled 3 cents to 6 higher with March at $ 4.39 -RCB- a bushel; corn was 2 -RCB- cents to 6 cents higher with March at $ 2.70 -LCB- a bushel; oats were 4 -LCB- cents to 6 cents higher with March at $ 2.37 -RCB- a bushel; and soybeans were unchanged to 8 -RCB- cents higher with March at $ 7.71 a bushel. Energy futures surged ahead on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> with crude oil prices breaking the psychologically important $ 19-a-barrel level and reaching new 14-month highs. Wholesale home heating oil and unleaded gasoline were up more than a penny a gallon. Analysts attributed the rally largely to a bullish trade report on oil production and to continued optimism that the 13-nation <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION> will abide by its production-cutting pact that went into effect Jan. 1. `` It seems there's a general perception that the steps taken to shore up this market are no temporary affair ... and that <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> has found the discipline it needs,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Beutel </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Elders </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Gold and silver futures prices fell modestly on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Commodity Exchange in reaction to the dollar's gains against major foreign currencies, analysts said Gold settled 70 cents to $ 1 lower with February at $ 403.30 a troy ounce; silver was 3.9 cents to 4 cents lower with March at $ 5.97 a troy ounce. Stock-index futures advanced strongly on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, where the contract for March delivery of stocks represented by the <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's 500 index settled 2.60 points higher at 288.70. The contract is worth $ 500 a point.

 Money traders scrambled to buy dollars Wednesday and boosted the currency despite a surprisingly big monthly <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit, confounding conventional wisdom that when the imbalance grows the dollar drops. Moreover, the dollar's strength grew despite repeated intervention by central banks, which sold the currency about an hour after the trade report was released in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` This is the last time we ever want to pay attention to the trade numbers again,'' said <PERSON> Zlatko </PERSON> <PERSON> Glamuzina </PERSON>, a senior foreign exchange dealer for the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> branch of <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Banco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> di </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sicilia </ORGANIZATION>. Gold prices eased in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trading. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> quoted bullion at $ 401.75 a troy ounce at 4 p.m. EST, compared with $ 402.50 at the same time Tuesday. The big story was the dollar's resilience despite a surprisingly huge $ 12.5 billion excess of imports over exports for November reported by the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. Market predictions were for an $ 11 billion deficit. The dollar declined initially when the trade number was released, but quickly stabilized against key currencies _ a signal to professional speculators that the dollar was undervalued and they should buy it. `` It was a trade number that would indicate sell dollars, which was done,'' said <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> <PERSON> Yannalfo </PERSON>, a senior foreign exchange dealer at <ORGANIZATION> Refco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> commodities futures firm. `` But then it stopped on a dime, buyers came in and the entire market realized the dollar was n't going down any further.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> entered the market at least three times to peddle dollars, but traders said the moves only slowed the dollar's rise and provided more opportunities for buying what they considered cheap dollars In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, the dollar rose 0.20 Japanese yen to 127.90 yen. Later in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> it was quoted at 128.45 yen. By the time trading ended in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> the dollar fetched 128.64 yen, up from 127.83 yen late Tuesday. The dollar gained against the British pound in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, where sterling fetched $ 1.7550 vs. $ 1.7680 late Tuesday. Later in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, sterling was quoted at $ 1.7535, down from $ 1.7707 late Tuesday. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, compared with rates late Tuesday, included: 1.8721 West German marks, up from 1.8495; 1.5915 Swiss francs, up from 1.5746; 1.1906 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1982; 6.3825 French francs, up from 6.3065; and 1,370.375 Italian lire, up from 1,355.375. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, compared with rates late Tuesday, included: 1.8705 marks, up from 1.8505; 1.5890 Swiss francs, up from 1.5755; 6.3800 French francs, up from 6.3085; 2.0925 Dutch guilders, up from 2.0855; 1,356.75 lire, up from 1,354.00; and 1.1937 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1973. In gold trading, the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commodities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> quoted bullion for current delivery at $ 402.30 a troy ounce, down 40 cents from Tuesday.

 <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday reported its fourth quarter net income rose 11 percent from a year earlier, buoyed by higher sales in its health care products, food and household products businesses. The company posted a profit of $ 238.6 million, or $ 1.63 a share, in the three months ended Dec. 31, compared with a profit of $ 215.2 million, or $ 1.47 a share, in the same period a year earlier. Sales during the quarter rose to $ 1.3 billion from $ 1.2 billion a year earlier. Net sales rose by 7 percent for health care products and 8 percent for food and household products. Results also benefited from a lower effective tax rate due to changes in the federal tax code last year. For the full year, <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> had a profit of $ 932.2 million, or $ 6.38 a share, on sales of $ 5.5 billion.

<HEAD>Fed Authorizes Five Banks to Underwrite Corporate Debt</HEAD>
<HEAD>EDs: ADDS 3 grafs with congressional reaction</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday authorized five of the nation's largest banks to underwrite corporate debt and said it would decide in a year whether to allow banks to underwrite stock. The unanimous decision by the seven-member board greatly expands the type of underwriting permitted, but still severely limits the quantity of underwriting. In 1987, the board approved bank underwriting of municipal revenue bonds, commercial paper, mortgage-backed securities and securities backed by consumer loans. In line with previous decisions, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> said bank holding companies may only conduct securities underwriting through a separate subsidiary regulated by the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. And, the subsidiary may earn no more than 5 percent of its revenue from underwriting activities authorized Wednesday and in 1987. The rest of the revenue must come from other types of business, such as the underwriting of general obligation bonds issued by municipalities and of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government securities, two areas that have always been open to banks. The five percent limit is designed to comply with the Depression-era Glass-Steagall Act which separated commercial and investment banking as part of the reforms passed by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> following the 1929 stock market crash and subsequent wave of bank failures. In another restriction, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> prohibited loans from federally insured banks and savings institutions to their securities affiliates. Also, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> said it `` expects banking organizations contemplating major expansion proposals to maintain strong capital levels substantially above minimum levels.'' `` This is quite a conservative framework for conducting this activity,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradfield </PERSON>, general counsel of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>. He noted that the board said previously it plans by mid-year to consider whether to raise the revenue limit to 10 percent. The five bank holding companies affected by Wednesday's decision are <ORGANIZATION> Citicorp </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's biggest; <ORGANIZATION> Chase </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manhattan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> J.P. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION> The decision permits the underwriting of all types of corporate debt, including bonds that can be converted into stock, provided the convertible bonds sell for 15 percent more than the equivalent amount of stock. <PERSON> Bradfield </PERSON> said the board decided to see how well banks do with debt underwriting before considering whether to allow stock underwriting. `` The board felt it was appropriate to proceed cautiously,'' he said. <PERSON> Bradfield </PERSON> said once the banks show they have the necessary managerial knowledge, operational capacity and capital to safely underwrite corporate debt, final approval will be issued `` on a fairly automatic basis,'' perhaps as soon as 30 days. The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION>'s decision fits in with a trend in recent years in which advances in bank deregulation have come through administrative and court decisions. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is fragmented on the issue and failed last year to pass comprehensive legislation restructuring the financial system. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Oglivie </PERSON>, executive vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, a trade group, praised Wednesday's move as `` another positive step by the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> toward banking reform.'' `` This should increase competition in the financial services industry and lower cost for consumers and businesses,'' he said in a statement. However, <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> action `` represents piecemeal dismantling of the appropriate separation which exists in the financial services industry _ a system which has worked exceedingly well for more than 50 years.'' The <ORGANIZATION> SIA </ORGANIZATION> has launched court challenges to previous deregulation moves by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON>, in his statement, said only that the <ORGANIZATION> SIA </ORGANIZATION> would review the decision. Two of the most vocal opponents in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> of weakening the Glass-Steagall barriers criticized the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> decision. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> is on its way to giving banks an invitation to shoot craps with the taxpayer's money,'' said Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON>, D-Mich., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> `` This is the kind if irresponsible behavior that gave us the savings and loan crisis and brought about the 1929 crash.'' `` It's troubling that regulators would go ahead and legislate simply because <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has n't done what they wanted it to. It's galling,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>

<HEAD>Quarterly, Annual Profits Up 13 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday its fourth-quarter and 1988 annual profits each rose 13 percent on revenue gains of more than 10 percent for each period. Fourth-quarter net income reached $ 248.7 million, or $ 1.71 per share, for the latest quarter from $ 219.6 million, or $ 1.51 per share, a year earlier. Revenue for the quarter rose 10.9 percent to $ 3.65 billion from $ 3.29 billion a year earlier. For the full year, profits rose to $ 822.8 million, or $ 5.66 per share, in 1988 compared with $ 724.8 million, or $ 5.02 per share, in 1987. Sales for the year rose 10.6 percent to $ 12.5 billion from $ 11.3 billion a year earlier. <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> has been extracting itself from less profitable businesses by selling them or arranging mergers and joint ventures. Operating profits rose in the fourth quarter and for the year in the company's industries, electronics and broadcasting groups. Operating profits fell for the quarter and were unchanged for the year in the energy and utility group, while they fell for both the quarter and the year in the commercial group. Financial services' operating profit held steady for the year but declined significantly in the fourth quarter due primarily to increased loan charge-offs and additions to loan loss reserves.

The yellow certificates were not federally-insured, as are real CDs, and the certificates' sales were kept off the bank's books and hidden from federal bank regulators. The money was used to generate a multi-million slush fund under the defendants' personal control and also to cover up failed loans and other high-risk investments.

 Unfazed by disappointing news on international trade, stock prices staged a broad advance Wednesday that carried the market to new highs since the 1987 crash. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials climbed 24.11 to 2,238.75, surpassing the recovery peak of 2,226.07 it reached last Friday. Advancing issues outnumbered declines by more than 2 to 1 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed stocks, with 1,036 up, 474 down and 468 unchanged. Volume on the floor of the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> reached 187.54 million shares, their highest level so far in the new year, against 143.93 million in the previous session. Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market, totaled 220.23 million shares. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported Wednesday morning that the nation's trade deficit widened to $ 12.51 billion in November from a revised $ 10.26 billion the month before. The latest number exceeded most advance estimates on Wall Street. But the news had only a short-lived impact on the markets. The dollar and bond prices quickly rebounded from it, and as they moved higher stocks followed their lead. Wall Streeters said they were heartened to see the market shrugging off unfavorable news on the trade situation, which has been a touchy issue for the markets for a long time. They also described the pickup in trading activity as a significant plus, suggesting that the market's recent advance was attracting a wider following among investors. Meanwhile, the market also absorbed the news of quarterly earnings from <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> that fell slightly short of expectations. <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>, which posted profits of $ 3.97 a share for the fourth quarter against $ 3.47 in the like period a year earlier, sold off early in the day but finished with a 1 -LRB- gain at 125. Among other actively traded blue chips, <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> rose -RRB- to 45 -LRB-; <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Telegraph </ORGANIZATION> | to 29 -RCB-; <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> ~ to 53, and <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> | to 45 ~ <ORGANIZATION> Tandem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computers </ORGANIZATION> jumped 1 | to 18 The company reported earnings for its first fiscal quarter ended Dec. 31 of 32 cents a share, up from 24 cents in the comparable period a year earlier. <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> slipped -LRB- to 95 -LRB- in active trading. <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roberts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said it had lined up more than $ 14 billion in bank loans to help finance its buyout of the company. As measured by <ORGANIZATION> Wilshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>' index of more than 5,000 actively traded stocks, the market increased $ 26.34 billion, or 0.94 percent, in value. The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>'s composite index of all its listed common stocks gained 1.53 to 161.01. <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's industrial index rose 3.58 to 331.56, and <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; P's 500-stock composite index was up 2.98 at 286.53 The NASDAQ composite index for the over-the-counter market picked up 2.83 to 388.88.

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit widened to $ 12.5 billion in November, the government said Wednesday in a report many private economists and even the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration viewed as a sign of the severity of the country's trade troubles. But the news that the trade imbalance was the biggest in five months and higher than advance predictions had little impact on financial markets, which posted strong performances. The stock market rose in heavy trading, with the Dow Jones average of 30 industrials climbed 24.11 to 2,238.75, surpassing its post-crash peak of 2,226.07 it reached last Friday. Some of the power driving equities higher came from the surprising resilience of the dollar. Frequently in the past, a poor trade report induced currency dealers to dump dollars but on Wednesday heavy buying pushed the dollar higher against most leading currencies. Taking a cue from the currency markets, bond prices rose with the benchmark 30-year <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bond gaining nearly $ 7 for each $ 1,000 in face value. In commodity markets, crude oil futures continued their recent rally and pierced the important psychological level of $ 19 a barrel. On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the February contract for <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intermediate </ORGANIZATION>, the key grade of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude, settled at $ 19.26 a barrel, up 31 cents from Tuesday. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> trade report said the gap was 22 percent larger than October's $ 10.3 billion deficit, reflecting a surge in imports, particularly for business capital goods, and a slight drop in exports. `` We have a serious competitiveness problem in this country,'' said <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Chimerine </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> WEFA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, an economic consulting firm in <PERSON> Bala </PERSON> <PERSON> Cynwyd </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION> `` There's a limit to how much you can improve by cutting costs and driving the dollar lower.'' At the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the November performance was of concern but `` we trust this is an aberration and does not change the overall trend.'' Even with the November deterioration, the trade deficit for the first 11 months of 1988 was running at an annual rate of $ 137.3 billion, almost 20 percent below the all-time imbalance of $ 170.3 billion set in 1987. Departing Commerce Secretary <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Verity </PERSON>, a top administration trade expert, said the November report was disappointing evidence that the country's trade problems are far from being solved. He said the rapid pace of improvement in the first part of 1988 had leveled off in recent months. `` All of this means that we have a long way to go,'' <ORGANIZATION> Verity </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement. `` We must continue to improve our efficiency and quality at home and pursue our efforts to reduce trade barriers abroad.'' In brighter economic news, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> reported that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> industry operated at 84.2 percent of capacity in December, the highest rate in nine years. Much of the increase reflected the boom <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> manufacturers have enjoyed in export sales as the weaker dollar made their products competitive once more on overseas markets. However, analysts said the November trade report showed that until Americans' appetite for imports is curbed, the trade imbalance will remain stuck in the $ 130 billion-a-year range, further increasing the country's dependency on foreign investment as Americans hand over billions of dollars every year to foreigners in exchange for cars, televisions and other imported products. President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> faces the problem of trying to improve <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s trade balance in order to keep the economic recovery alive. But analysts said he must accomplish that task without erecting more trade barriers and further worsening global trading tensions. `` The trade report is disturbing. It is evidence that for the last seven months we have n't made any progress on the trade adjustment process,'' said <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON>, senior economist at <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The November deficit was the largest since a $ 13.2 billion June imbalance. November's deficit reflected a big jump in imports, which shot up to $ 39.7 billion, $ 1.6 billion above the October level and the second highest level on record. Exports fell by $ 639 million to $ 27.2 billion. Many economists believe that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar, which actually rose a bit in the last year, will have to decline further to spur more export gains. For November, the 4.2 percent rise in imports reflected big increases in shipments of business capital equipment, which rose by $ 1.1 billion, and consumer goods, which climbed by $ 697 million. The auto category actually dropped by $ 229 million during November and the nation's oil bill fell a slight 0.4 percent to $ 3.13 billion, reflecting a drop in both the amount of oil imported and the price, which edged down to an average of $ 13.38 per barrel. The rise in capital goods reflected increases in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> purchases of iron and steel products, airplanes and heavy equipment such as metal working machinery. Faced with high operating rates, <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> industry has been rushing to expand production facilities. In many cases, however, the new equipment has been purchased from overseas suppliers. The 2.3 percent drop in exports in November reflected declines in sales of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> farm products and capital goods.

 Canadian brewing giants <ORGANIZATION> Molson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cos. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Carling </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Keefe </PERSON> announced Wednesday they're joining forces to create a new super-company capable of tapping the vast <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> beer market The new company, an equal partnership between <ORGANIZATION> Molson </ORGANIZATION> and Carling parent Elders <ORGANIZATION> IXL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, will be called <ORGANIZATION> Molson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Breweries </ORGANIZATION> and will have combined sales of about $ 2.3 billion, <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, president and chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION> Molson </ORGANIZATION>, told a news conference. He said the venture will control slightly more than half the Canadian market while ranking as the sixth-largest brewer in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and the 20th largest in the world. `` This North American partnership ensures <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> has a position in the highly competitive world beer market,'' <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> said. `` We want to penetrate the North American market and increase our exports considerably.'' Analysts described that objective as elusive, given the intense jockeying for market share south of the border. In <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Carling </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Molson </ORGANIZATION> together employ about 7,000 people at 17 breweries. Executives of the new company will meet over the next 10 days to develop a $ 200 million, 2-year strategy for `` rationalizing'' these operations that will mean the creation of large, modern plants comparable to those in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Plant closings _ possibly one per <LOCATION> Canadian </LOCATION> province _ and layoffs will inevitably result, although about half the jobs lost will be through attrition and early retirement, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON>, Elders chairman and chief executive officer. `` The Canadian brewing industry is one of the most inefficient in the world,'' <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON> said. `` There is not one plant in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> that is up to the minimum efficiency requirements to compete against the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' <ORGANIZATION> Molson </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Carling </PERSON> together currently export to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> about 15 million cases of beer a year, an amount they hope to increase to 40 million, <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> said.
