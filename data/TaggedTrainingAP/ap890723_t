 Until June 2, <PERSON> Sousuke </PERSON> <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> was seen as a successful Japanese politician who had probably reached the pinnacle of his career as foreign minister. Then he became his party's last-ditch choice for prime minister, and his world quickly crumbled amid a welter of accusations about his private life and a crushing defeat suffered by the party he reluctantly led. On Monday Uno said he would resign to take responsibility for the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s defeat in elections for the upper house of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, leaving his deeply troubled party in its second leadership crisis in two months. <PERSON> Uno </PERSON>, 66, will remain in office until the party chooses a new leader, which may take weeks. It took more than six weeks before the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> finally chose him to take over from <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>. <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> was not the party's first choice. For weeks its elders had tried to persuade the scandal-free <PERSON> Masayoshi </PERSON> <PERSON> Ito </PERSON> to become prime minister, but <PERSON> Ito </PERSON> refused. <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> was not a party leader or a previous contender for the premiership, and his name was not mentioned until late in the chase. But when he emerged as the choice, it appeared the party had made a safe but not exciting choice of a competent caretaker. The son of a wealthy sake-brewing family, <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> was untainted by the Recruit bribery scandal that had ruled out all the party's elite He had served in a number of Cabinet posts before becoming foreign minister and he had diplomatic skills to represent <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> at the approaching summit in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> of the seven industrialized democracies. But less than a week after he took office on June 2, published allegations that he kept a paid geisha mistress began to plague him. The allegations about his private life _ he did not quite deny them, saying instead he had done nothing immoral _ became another major problem the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> struggled with as crucial parliamentary elections approached. The party had suffered a steep decline in popularity from the Recruit scandal that embroiled its elite in suspicions of bribe-taking. It also was on the defensive over a new sales tax and agriculture policy. Although prime ministers usually are major campaigners to boost their party's hopes before an election, <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> made few public appearances in advance of Sunday's vote for half the seats in the upper house. Analysts predicted he would resign if the party did poorly. It did, losing its majority in the upper house, and <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> quickly followed by taking the traditional step of resigning to take responsibility. His political epitaph may be the words he reportedly uttered on June 27 in a plea to party leaders to let him step down: `` I did n't become prime minister because I wanted to.

 The search for victims of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> Flight 232 ended Saturday with the death toll tentatively set at 110. <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>, meanwhile, announced it is visually inspecting all engines in its DC-10 fleet. `` We feel comfortable enough that ... the search has been terminated for victims,'' said <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Woodbury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>. While officials were confident that all of the bodies had been recovered, there still was disagreement on how many were killed when the DC-10 jetliner cartwheeled and burned Wednesday at the <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gateway </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> said it was 110 and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> said it was 111. But a <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopatkiewicz </PERSON>, said at a news briefing late Saturday the agency was `` deferring to <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>. That does n't mean we agree United is the authority on this.'' A list compiled by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> of names supplied by <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> and family, friends and employers of the victims had put the toll of dead and missing at 111. But two people listed with the same last name and slightly different first names were determined to be the same person. A doctor at one of the hospitals treating the injured said more patients could die and that the survivors might have permanent injuries. Of the 296 people on board, 186 survived. At the news briefing Saturday evening, <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON> said the parts of rear No. 2 engine that disintegrated during a flight from <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> were well within the limits of time in which they had to be replaced. <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON> also said investigators interviewed Flight 232's second officer Saturday, flight engineer <PERSON> Dudley </PERSON> <PERSON> Dvorak </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dvorak </PERSON> told inspectors he reported complete loss of fluid in all three hydraulic lines after the rear engine blew apart, leaving Capt. <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Haynes </PERSON> without control of wings or tail surfaces. In another development, a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> official said at a news conference here that the airline has initiated `` a visual inspection of all engines in our DC-10 fleet. A prudent person would do some additional looking and we are.'' <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Guyette </PERSON>, executive vice president of operations for <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>, said the inspections should be completed on Monday. So far, they have uncovered `` very, very minor'' flaws, he said, adding that DC-10 airplanes in the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> fleet </ORGANIZATION> are not being grounded during the check. In <LOCATION> Chariton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, meanwhile, an <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> train carrying survivors of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> flight struck and killed a 6-year-old boy as the youngster tried to free his bicycle that was stuck on the tracks. <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Howie </PERSON> was struck by <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION>'s eastbound <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zephyr </LOCATION> after the train had picked up several crash survivors at <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Neb. </LOCATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Art </PERSON> <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON>, who added that he did not know how many survivors were on board. In <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, the wreckage of the wide-body jet remained sprawled over the airport Saturday as <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> crews sifted wreckage for clues to what caused the tail engine to disintegrate in flight. <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON> said four cranes were moved in to steady a giant hunk of fuselage in the cornfield next to the runway. Inspectors were able to determine that no bodies were underneath, he said. So far, the airline has positively identified 19 dead and tentatively identified 29, and hopes to have 80 percent of the bodies positively identified by Sunday, <PERSON> Guyette </PERSON> said. `` Great care has to be exercised to make sure a mistake is not made,'' he said. Forty-five people were still hospitalized Saturday. Nineteen, including four in critical condition, were at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Luke </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> and 26, including five listed as critical, were at the <ORGANIZATION> Marian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Marian </PERSON> confirmed that one patient had died there overnight but would not give a name. Dr. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Foster </PERSON>, medical director for the burn unit at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Luke </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION>, said they have 10 patients in the unit, who have burns from 2 percent to 93 percent of their bodies. Most suffered burns on face and extremities. All four members of the flight crew, including one off-duty pilot who left his seat in the cabin and to help in the effort to control the plane, were being treated at <PERSON> Marian </PERSON>. Their injuries were not critical, according to spokeswoman <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON> <PERSON> Denning </PERSON>. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said there was no need to look for other victims at the airport. `` The numbers match, the numbers balance,'' he said. Dr. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolpert </PERSON>, director of trauma services at <PERSON> Marian </PERSON>, said the five patients in critical condition are still in danger. `` They're not stable by any means,'' he said. `` There are a lot of broken necks and broken backs. Some of them might be permanently disabled. Some of them have definite brain swelling now but it's going to be quite a while before we know if that damage is going to be permanent.'' He said patients listed in serious or guarded condition have multiple fractures but are not in life-threatening condition. A large number of them, he said, have ankle injuries. The airport is open but large pieces of the doomed jet are strewn over the area. Still in a cornfield is the large piece of the fuselage from which survivors were able to crawl to safety, and the charred remains of the tail section, which flipped over the other wreckage as the plane broke up. `` There's a lot of documentation left to be done,'' said <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopatkiewicz </PERSON>, declining to predict when investigators would leave the scene. `` It takes a long time to document an aircraft as big as this.'' The drama of the final moments in the cockpit was detailed Friday as <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON> said the off-duty pilot, hearing the explosion in engine No. 2, bolted to the cockpit to see if he could help. <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON> said the off-duty pilot, identified as <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitch </PERSON>, found the airplane nearly unmanageable since the tail engine apparently threw wreckage through the airplane's hydraulic systems. Without control of wings or tail surfaces, the pilots' only recourse was to crudely steer the plane by varying the thrust of the two remaining engines. `` The only control mechanism that the crew had was to use engine thrust,'' <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON> said. The off-duty pilot `` was on his knees manipulating the throttle.'' `` What you have here is a situation of two men desperately trying to get whatever control they can out of the aircraft,'' he said. Seven minutes before he attempted an emergency landing at <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gateway </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, pilot <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Haynes </PERSON> told the control tower, `` Whatever you do, keep us away from the city,'' <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON> quoted <PERSON> Haynes </PERSON> as telling investigators during two one-hour interviews on Friday. The airport is about seven miles from downtown. The crew also found that the airplane would only turn right, further hindering efforts to line up with a runway.

<HEAD>President of U.N. Assembly Denies Charges He Misused Funds</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUENOS AIRES, Argentina (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Dante </PERSON> <PERSON> Caputo </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, on Saturday denied charges he misused public funds while serving as <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>'s foreign minister from late 1983 until four months ago. On Friday, the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> filed charges in criminal court alleging <PERSON> Caputo </PERSON> failed to adequately explain how he spent nearly $ 190,000 of the $ 538,200 he received for personal expenses while he was foreign minister. The ministry accused him of misappropriating public funds. `` If there is a charge, the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> should investigate to see what it is about,'' <PERSON> Caputo </PERSON> said Saturday in a radio interview. The case against <PERSON> Caputo </PERSON> involves the apparent use of the same stamp on receipts allegedly received in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Stockholm </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>. The stamp was found at the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, a source there said, along with blank copies of hotel stationery. A ministry official was arrested in connection with the case, police confirmed Saturday. He was not identified, nor were the charges disclosed. In an interview with <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mundo </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Caputo </PERSON> said, `` I do n't know anything about the contents'' of the charges. About his alleged involvement he said: `` The only thing I do with such funds is sign a receipt, and after that I do n't worry about the topic.'' The complaint filed by the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> stated in part: `` <PERSON> Dante </PERSON> <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Caputo </PERSON> acted as though it is up to the government to justify the courtesy expenses that he says were made in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Stockholm </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, presenting papers that were stamped as paid with one and the same stamp.'' `` Documents appear that ... do not meet the mimimal appearance of seriousness,'' the complaint stated. <PERSON> Caputo </PERSON> personally received $ 538,200 for expenses, it said, `` and he has the legal obligation to account for it.''

 An 11-year-old boy successfully finished his bid Saturday to become the youngest pilot to circle the globe, landing safely at home after a trip that took him across the far reaches of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Aliengena </PERSON> touched down under bright, hazy skies at about 2:30 p.m. and turned off the engine of his plane at <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> John </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wayne </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, where he started his `` Friendship Flight'89'' seven weeks and 19,000 miles ago `` I want to meet President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and talk with my parents and see if they will take me to <ORGANIZATION> Disneyland </ORGANIZATION>,'' the boy said after landing. Flight observer <PERSON> Gunter </PERSON> <PERSON> Hagen </PERSON>, who accompanied the boy during the entire flight, said he will submit his records to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, which sanctions flight records. <PERSON> Hagen </PERSON> said he will recommend the group create a new category for youngest pilot to fly around the world and grant <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> that status. <PERSON> Aliengena </PERSON>'s father <PERSON> Gary </PERSON>, who accompanied his son on the flight, emerged from the plane and then lifted his son from the aircraft, along with his sister <PERSON> Alaina </PERSON>, 10, and <PERSON> Tony </PERSON>'s Soviet pen pal, Roman Tcheremnykh, 10. <PERSON> Aliengena </PERSON> earlier Saturday took off from <LOCATION> Seattle-Tacoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, stopped for refueling in <PERSON> Reno </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Nev. </LOCATION>, and then headed for <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. The pilot and his entourage decided to skip a stop at <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, because of a delay in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> that put them a day behind schedule, said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Combie </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, a spokesman for the boy. `` They are all glad to be back in the lower 48,'' Combie said. The final leg was to be about 1,300 miles, he said. After he arrived in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> Friday night, <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> said that when he gets home he wants to ride his bike for a while `` and then I'd like to meet President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, maybe.'' The fourth-grader flew a borrowed single-engine plane to <LOCATION> Sea-Tac </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Juneau </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, along with his flight-instructor father, <PERSON> Gary </PERSON>, his mother, <PERSON> Susan </PERSON>, 10-year-old sister <PERSON> Alaina </PERSON>, and the rest of his party. The single-engine <ORGANIZATION> Cessna </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Centurion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tony </ORGANIZATION> started with crashed Tuesday while his father was taking off from <LOCATION> Golovin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, 90 miles from <LOCATION> Nome </LOCATION>, for a fishing side trip. No one was seriously hurt. That crash, which is under investigation by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, was the only sour note on the 19,000-mile trip with 35 stops in seven countries, <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> said Friday night. `` I really liked the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, especially <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` I also liked <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> because that's where all my relatives are.'' <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> and his party, a second plane carrying some of them, made 14 stops in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> alone. <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> said aviation will always be just a hobby. `` I want to be an orthopedic surgeon,'' he said. He plans to visit the White House to see President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and present him with the Friendship Scroll, which is more than 1,000 feet long and contains more than 200,000 signatures of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> children.

 A <ORGANIZATION> CSX </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> freight train derailed Saturday, igniting a fire in a tank car loaded with toxic chemicals and in at least one house, officials said. More than 400 people were evacuated. At least seven people were evaluated at hospitals, apparently because of problems caused by fume inhalation, said <LOCATION> Saginaw </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> spokesman <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Caylor </PERSON>. `` They ... appear to be OK at this time,'' he said. Fourteen of 37 cars on the <ORGANIZATION> CSX </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> train derailed; seven were empty and seven were chemical tank cars, said <ORGANIZATION> CSX </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Ripley </PERSON> <PERSON> Watson </PERSON>. Officials initially believed at least two cars were afire, but later determined only one caught fire and was still burning. A 1-square-mile evacuation area around the derailment site was broadened to 10 miles, forcing more than 400 people from their homes, <PERSON> Caylor </PERSON> said. State Police Sgt. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Mynsberge </PERSON> said the evacuation order could remain in effect for two days. An order to evacuate the southeast corner of <LOCATION> Midland </LOCATION> was canceled late Saturday and those residents were told to stay inside, close their windows and turn off ventilation systems in their homes, said <LOCATION> Midland </LOCATION> Fire Chief <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> Gay </PERSON>. Fumes from the fire are `` drifting into more populated areas,'' <PERSON> Beeson </PERSON> said. Earlier, a plume of black smoke rose from the burning cars, said Dow spokesman <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Black </PERSON>. Winds were calm after the derailment just before noon. At least one house was burning, <PERSON> Black </PERSON> said, but the extent of damage was n't known. It was not clear if the house and the train car were burning in separate fires, officials said after conducting aerial surveys. Heavy smoke and intense heat prevented firefighters from getting closer. Five tank cars were carrying acrylonitrile and styrene, both used in the manufacture of rubber; acrylic acid; naphtha, and <PERSON> Chlorosilenes </PERSON>, a product of <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a joint venture between <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> and Corning Glass Works that produces silicon products. Acrylonitrile is a highly flammable liquid that is toxic if inhaled or absorbed through the skin. <PERSON> Styrene </PERSON> also is toxic if inhaled or ingested. Acrylic acid irritates the skin and is toxic if inhaled. Naphtha is highly flammable. <PERSON> Black </PERSON> said a company emergency team was at the site between <LOCATION> Midland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Saginaw </LOCATION>, about 80 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>. `` They are in the process of separating the cars that are not involved in the derailment and going in with the protective suits to identify which cars are involved in the fire,'' he said Saturday afternoon. He said the derailment involved a load headed for the <ORGANIZATION> Midland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cogeneration </ORGANIZATION> venture, a joint project of <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Consumers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> to convert the utility's never-finished nuclear power plant into a gas-fired generator. The same tracks have been used for more than 10 years to carry toxic chemicals between <ORGANIZATION> Freeport </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Midland </LOCATION>, on a regularly scheduled run known as the Unit Train.

<TEXT>
 A top career diplomat suspected of collaborating with Soviet agents in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> had access to some of the nation's most sensitive non-nuclear secrets and once ran the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> embassy in that espionage-rich city before he was sent home for insubordination, sources said Saturday. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Felix </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON>, former deputy chief of mission at the embassy in <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, has received <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> approval to leave his <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> luxury apartment. But the surveillance of <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON> continues at a new, unspecified location, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> reported Saturday. <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON>, who has not been charged with any crime, is the highest-ranking <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomat ever identified as the target of an intelligence investigation involving the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. The government is keeping close tabs on <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON> so he wo n't flee but <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> said that federal officials also are concerned that he might try to hurt himself. <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON> was last seen by fellow residents of his apartment building on Thursday. Since then, they say, a heavy contingent of government agents, whose surveillance of <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON> had been obvious to his neighbors for weeks, apparently has departed as well. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> declined comment Saturday about the status of its investigation, which was brought to light the previous night by an <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> report which said he had been videotaped passing a briefcase to a Soviet <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> agent in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>. That incident, according to sources who declined to be identified, occurred early this year, more than a year after <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON> was reassigned to a largely bureaucratic post in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Government sources told <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> that, once confronted with allegations of his spying, <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON> fell apart emotionally. The report said <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON> has been interrogated two times and claimed he would cooperate. But one government analyst told the television network that <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON>'s cooperation has been `` extremely limited.'' A team of government psychologists, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> said, does not believe that <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON> spied for money. Sources told <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> that <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON> claimed he spied because he fell into a Soviet sex trap but investigators have discounted that story. The Los Angeles Times, citing an anonymous <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government official familiar with the case, reported Sunday that <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON> was under suspicion of spying `` for a substantial period of time.'' Austrian Foreign Minister <PERSON> Alois </PERSON> <PERSON> Moch </PERSON> was quoted by the Kurier newspaper in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> as saying <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON> apparently came under suspicion by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities in the 1970s, the Times noted. The government has not charged <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON>, hoping that he will voluntarily tell investigators the extent of the information he provided to the East, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> said. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, former Ambassador <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lauder </PERSON>, a candidate for the Republican nomination for mayor, said Saturday that he demanded in 1987 that <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON> be recalled to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> because `` He went outside of channels ... he went around me'' in dealings with the Austrian Foreign Ministry. <PERSON> Lauder </PERSON> said, however, that he had no indication that <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON>, an Austrian native, had been dealing with the Soviets. <PERSON> Lauder </PERSON>, a political appointee as ambassador who himself has been criticized for his service in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, said he inherited <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON> as his top deputy when he arrived at the embassy in April 1986. <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON> had been there for six years already, and was in charge of the embassy during a lapse between the departure of <PERSON> Helene </PERSON> <PERSON> Von </PERSON> <PERSON> Damm </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lauder </PERSON>'s confirmation, <PERSON> Lauder </PERSON> said. A congressional source, meanwhile, speculated that <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON> was the effective day-to-day chief of the embassy throughout the time that Ms. <PERSON> Von </PERSON> <PERSON> Damm </PERSON>, also a political appointee and widely criticized as a social butterfly, was there. <PERSON> Lauder </PERSON> said he grew increasingly dissatisfied with <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON> over `` insubordination'' and demanded that he be recalled in July 1987. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> complied within a matter of `` days or weeks,'' he said. <PERSON> Lauder </PERSON> said he knew nothing of the current investigation before hearing news reports Friday. He said he has since spoken with the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> about the case, but declined elaboration. `` I thought he was a poor member of the staff. So I got rid of him. If I thought he was a spy, I would have had him arrested,'' <PERSON> Lauder </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Lauder </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON> did have access to `` a great deal'' of classified information, and that he `` could do severe damage.'' But `` At this point we do not know'' whether that has occurred. `` It could have potential impact, a great deal of impact on the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Lauder </PERSON> continued. `` He had a great deal of access.''

 An <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> jetliner was buffeted by turbulence Saturday night near <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> and at least 35 people were taken to hospitals after the aircraft landed, a spokesman for the carrier said.

 The chief government censor was shot and killed Sunday, police and witnesses said. <PERSON> Themis </PERSON> <PERSON> Guruge </PERSON>, who also headed the government-owned radio station, was taking a walk near his home at <LOCATION> Polhengoda </LOCATION>, 4 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Colombo </LOCATION> when he was shot by two unidentified gunmen riding in a white car, police said on condition of anonymity. <PERSON> Guruge </PERSON>, 60, a well-known broadcaster, was named head of the government's four-person censorship committee two weeks ago. Censorship on local and foreign press reports was imposed amid escalating ethnic violence and a growing dispute between <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION> over the presence of a 40,000-man Indian peacekeeping force. <PERSON> Guruge </PERSON>, a Sinhalese, was appointed chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Sri </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lanka </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> two months ago. Radio employees have received death threats from Sinhalese extremists in the past. Police gave no indication who may have been responsible for the killing. No one immediately claimed responsibility. Witnesses, speaking on condition of anonymity, said <PERSON> Guruge </PERSON>'s family rushed him to a hospital and their car was fired on by police at a checkpoint One relative was slightly wounded, the witnesses said. <PERSON> Guruge </PERSON> was pronounced dead on arrival at <ORGANIZATION> Colombo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>. On Friday, Agriculture Minister <PERSON> Lalith </PERSON> <PERSON> Athulathmudali </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> that censoring the press, both local and foreign, was proving to be counter-productive. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Ranjan </PERSON> <PERSON> Wijeratne </PERSON>, who announced the censorship July 6, said he agreed and promised to lift it soon, at least for foreign media. In the past six years, about 15,000 people have died in <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s ethnic violence. About 11,000 have died in the Tamil separatist war in the northeast, where Indian troops have been deployed since July 30, 1987 in an as yet unsuccessful effort to pacify Tamil guerrillas. About 4,000 people, mostly Sinhalese government officials and supporters, have been killed by Sinhalese extremists who accuse the Sinhalese-dominatd government of making too many concessions to the Tamil minority. Tamils comprise 18 percent of <LOCATION> Sri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lanka </LOCATION>'s 16 million people and say they are discriminated against by the Sinhalese majority in jobs, education and use of the Sinhala language. Sinhalese, who account for 75 percent of the population, dominate the government and military.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s governing <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> conceded defeat in parliamentary elections Sunday after projections indicated it had lost its upper house majority for the first time in more than three decades. `` This is a big defeat,'' the conservative party's secretary general, <PERSON> Ryutaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Hashimoto </PERSON>, said in a televised interview. `` I am very sorry.'' A major loss for the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> would increase pressure for a general election and for a change of leadership in the scandal-plagued party. The <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said their projections indicated the Liberal Democrats were certain to lose their majority in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Councillors </ORGANIZATION>, the upper house of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s two-chamber <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. Voters were deciding half of the house's 252 seats in Sunday's balloting. Final official results were not expected until Monday evening. A heavy turnout by <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s 90.3 eligible voters reflected strong feelings over a new sales tax, an unpopular farm policy and stock and sex scandals that have eroded the popularity of the governing party, according to opinion polls. `` The situation is extremely severe,'' <PERSON> Hashimoto </PERSON> said in an earlier interview Sunday. `` Though the final results are not in yet, it appears our old pattern is not working.'' <PERSON> Takako </PERSON> <PERSON> Doi </PERSON>, chairwoman of the main opposition <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which was leading in the projections, told reporters: `` This is the result of the people's choice.'' By late Sunday night, the <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> projected the results for 88 of the 126 seats being contested in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Councillors </ORGANIZATION>. It said 25 would go to the Liberal Democrats, 34 to the leftist Socialists, six to the centrist <ORGANIZATION> Clean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, two each to the Communists and the conservative Social Democrats, eight to independents and 11 to minor parties. <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> gave similar projections, and both the news service and the <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> predicted that the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> would not win the 54 seats they needed to maintain a simple majority in the upper chamber. Although the Socialists were doing well in the projections, a majority in the upper house will remain out of their reach because they would need to win 84 seats and they ran only 54 candidates in the election. The Liberal Democrats went into the election with 142 seats, compared to 43 for the Socialists and 23 for the Clean Government Party. A political party needs 127 seats for a simply majority in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Councillors </ORGANIZATION> and 139 seats to control all 16 permanent standing committees in the house. The Socialists have led efforts to create an opposition coalition with the <ORGANIZATION> Clean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialists </ORGANIZATION> and the leftist <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION>, which now has no seats in the upper chamber. If the Liberal Democrats lose control of the upper house, they will find it harder to pass legislation. But the party holds 293 of the 512 seats in the more powerful lower house, where elections need not be called until July 1990. The Liberal Democrats have produced all of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s prime ministers since it was formed in 1955. But a poor showing by Prime Minister <PERSON> Sousuke </PERSON> <PERSON> Uno </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> could increase pressure on Uno, in office less than two months, to resign and lead to early elections for the lower house of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. A Liberal Democratic loss there could bring <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> a Socialist-led government, since the lower house elects the prime minister. The Liberal Democrats, who represent conservative interests in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, have been hurt by a scandal centering around the <ORGANIZATION> Recruit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a publishing conglomerate that was accused of doling out millions of dollars in underpriced stocks and political donations to obtain favors. Disclosures in the scandal led to the resignations of three Cabinet ministers and Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>. Shortly after he succeeded <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> June 2, reports began to appear that Uno had kept paid geisha mistresses, igniting criticism from women's groups. The geisha scandal forced Uno to keep a low profile during campaigning, strengthening his image as a caretaker who will remain in office only until Oct. 31, when <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s term as party president would have expired. Farmers, traditional supporters of Uno's party, also revolted against its moves to open <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s agricultural market wider to imports. The Socialists rallied voters against a new 3 percent sales tax that was heavily backed by the governing party. The Socialists, putting forward a record number of women candidates, took advantage of housewives' anger over the tax, which was bulldozed through <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> by the governing party last year despite an opposition boycott. The tax, part of a sweeping tax reform, took effect April 1.

<TEXT>
 Archbishop <PERSON> Desmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> on Sunday accused the head of the governing <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> of a `` crude attempt'' to create a split between the <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and its imprisoned leader, <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>. <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON>, a black Anglican active in the anti-apartheid movement, challenged an assertion by F.W. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> that the burden was on the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> to renounce its guerrilla campaign against the white-led government as a precondition to negotiations. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON>, expected to succeed P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> as president after elections Sept. 6, said Saturday the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> should `` follow the lead'' of <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> by committing itself to a peaceful settlement. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> was referring to the meeting between <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> earlier this month in which the two leaders expressed support for `` peaceful development'' in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. `` <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> has his history wrong,'' <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> said in a statement. `` Our liberation movements have sought change peacefully since before 1910. It is his government which forced the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> and PAC -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Pan-Africanist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- to turn to violence by banning them, and it his his government which must un-ban them and create conditions conducive to negotiations.'' <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON>'s `` crude attempt to drive a wedge between Mr. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> is deplorable and indicates he is not serious about negotiations,'' <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, in a brief statement following his meeting with <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>, confirmed that he had endorsed `` peaceful development'' but stressed that no peaceful solution could be found unless the government negotiated with the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> and its allies in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> has waged a bombing and sabotage campaign in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> since 1961, a year after it was outlawed. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> was jailed in 1962. He is serving a life sentence for sabotage and plotting to overthrow the government. The <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> has rejected <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON>'s recent proposals for a five-year plan to give the disenfranchised black majority a formal voice in national politics without letting it impose its will on the white minority. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> is the overwhelming favorite to retain control in the white election Sept. 6, but a newspaper poll published Sunday indicated that liberal and conservative opposition parties could do well enough to deprive the Nationalists of an outright majority in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. The poll, commissioned by the nationally circulated <ORGANIZATION> Sunday </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, said the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> would win 78 seats in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, the far-right <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> 52 and the anti-apartheid <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> 36 if the election were held this week and there was an 80 percent turnout. Details about how the poll was conducted were not published. A separate poll published Sunday in the Afrikaans-language newspaper Rapport predicted the Nationalists would win about 46 percent of the vote, the Conservatives 25 percent and the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> about 29 percent.

 Dissident <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> <PERSON> Lizhi </PERSON> is the guest who never comes to dinner. He never appears at parties at the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>, where he has lived since early June, but somehow he manages to haunt them. Guests inevitably peer down halls and around corners in hopes of glimpsing the man whose invisible presence has helped bring U.S.-Chinese relations to their lowest level since normalization in 1979. But even some high-level embassy staff say they have never seen the short, plump astrophysicist or his wife, physics professor <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Shuxian </PERSON>, who is in hiding with him. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> disclosed June 6 that the couple, outspoken critics of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> rulers, had taken shelter in the embassy after the army moved in on pro-democracy protesters in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. The Chinese government issued arrest warrants for the pair, accusing them of orchestrating the protests. Embassy officials refuse to say even which of the three walled embassy compounds houses the Fangs. They may live in comfort in a guest room at Ambassador <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Lilleys </PERSON>' home. Then again, perhaps they are hidden from Chinese staff in more secure, but less homey, quarters. Do they use the embassy pool at night when everyone has gone home? Do they watch <ORGANIZATION> Cable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> television, now banned elsewhere in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, off the embassy's satellite dish? Embassy staff only shrug. Most change the subject or walk away when someone mentions <PERSON> Fang </PERSON>'s name. But now and then someone makes a joke, as when Counselor <PERSON> McKinney </PERSON> <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> turned to a guest at the embassy's Independence Day picnic and asked if he had met Professor <PERSON> Fang </PERSON>. The guest took the bait and asked eagerly to be introduced. <PERSON> Fang </PERSON>, of course, did not attend. <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> probably would have enjoyed the picnic and the joke. A friendly man with a puckish sense of humor, he often laughs heartily during conversation. But his calls for the all-powerful <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> to allow political debate and even formation of new parties are serious. `` Some people think <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> does n't need democracy, but I think human rights are basic. For them to be realized, first of all famous people must take a stand,'' he said in February, during a relative thaw that preceded the April start of the student movement. <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> gained fame internationally as <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s most articulate human rights spokesman, but his initial renown at home came as <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s first physicist to specialize in black hole theory. He became a hero to many intellectuals in 1987, when the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> ousted him for making pro-democracy speeches it said helped incite student marches. The party distributed copies of the speeches to be criticized during political study sessions, but many readers secretly found themselves in agreement. <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> was not a frequent visitor at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>. However, one embassy invitation caused an international stir _ to a banquet given by visiting President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in February. Chinese police stopped <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> en route and refused to let him attend. The Chinese government lodged a formal protest with the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> over that invitation, and again when it gave shelter to <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> and <PERSON> Li </PERSON>. But <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> mostly vented its ire in newspaper commentaries that branded <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> a traitor and the `` scum of the nation,'' and accused <PERSON> Li </PERSON> of not having `` a real Chinese heart.'' Newspapers accused the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy of violating international law by sheltering the couple. The embassy was deluged with phone calls from Chinese expressing their indignation. An ambassador who lives near the main <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy compound reportedly complained to the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> that Chinese were standing outside shouting epithets at <LOCATION> Fang </LOCATION> in the middle of the night. Chinese police who normally guard foreign embassies have multiplied outside the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> facilities since <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> and <PERSON> Li </PERSON> took up residence, and the officers now carry automatic pistols. Half a dozen uniformed and plainclothes police camp around the clock outside <PERSON> Lilley </PERSON>'s residence. They sit on low stools, drinking tea and playing cards, and hang laundry from a small guard booth, giving it the look of a squatter camp. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> security also has tightened. The compound where the ambassador lives used to leave its gates open. Now they are locked and even <LOCATION> Americans </LOCATION> must show their passports to enter. The Fangs' options are limited. They can leave the embassy and face arrest, or stay inside as virtual prisoners. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has said it would like to reach a compromise with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> that would allow the couple to leave for a third country, but <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> insists they are criminals who must be prosecuted. Neither side will say if talks are going on. Meanwhile, one scientific research society has expelled <PERSON> Fang </PERSON>, and a city district people's congress to which <PERSON> Li </PERSON> was elected in 1987 is discussing expelling her. Staff who answered the telephone at the <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Observatory </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> works, said his name remains on the list of employees. It is unlikely he will return to work there, however, as long as the current government is in power. `` I am like a soldier who has already crossed the river. There's no way to turn back,'' <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> said in an interview last year Never has that been truer.

 <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s 49th postwar government was sworn in Sunday after <PERSON> Giulio </PERSON> <PERSON> Andreotti </PERSON> formed a five-party coalition and ended a 65-day political crisis brought on by the resignation of Premier <PERSON> Ciriaco </PERSON> <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Mita </PERSON>. The coalition formed Saturday is comprised of the same centrist parties that have ruled together for most of the 1980s, and no major changes in policy were foreseen. The coalition parties have a comfortable majority in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> and the government was expected to easily win a vote of confidence this week. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> is expected to hold its debate on the new government on Wednesday or Thursday, while the <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION>, the lower house, is scheduled to vote on the new government at week's end. On Sunday morning, President <PERSON> Francesco </PERSON> <PERSON> Cossiga </PERSON> swore in <PERSON> Andreotti </PERSON> to his sixth term as premier. Afterward, other Cabinet members took the oath in front of <PERSON> Cossiga </PERSON> and <PERSON> Andreotti </PERSON>. After the swearing-in, the 70-year-old premier met with the other 31 members of the Cabinet. <PERSON> Andreotti </PERSON> told reporters his government is like a child: `` It's small at birth but can grow strong and robust. The new premier has said he will concentrate on preparing <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> for 1992, when the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> drops its internal barriers to trade and becomes a single market. Other priorities include fighting crime, tax evasion and pollution, he said.

<HEAD>Opposition Resigns from Parliament to Protest Gun Deal</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SHARON HERBAUGH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW DELHI, India (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 All 106 opposition members in the lower house of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> resigned Sunday to protest Prime Minister <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s refusal to step down over a controversial foreign arms deal. The decision by the 12 opposition parties in the <LOCATION> Lok </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sabha </LOCATION>, the lawmaking branch of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, was sparked by an auditor's report citing inconsistencies in the 1986 purchase of $ 1.4 billion in Swedish artillery guns. Opposition members and news reports allege officials received millions of dollars in kickbacks in return for securing the contract for the Swedish company. The move was not expected to have much effect on <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> since <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> commands a majority, but opposition leaders said they hoped it would call attention to the arms deal and make it a major issue in the next election, due by January. `` Never before has the office of the prime minister been brought into disrepute as under the present incumbent,'' said V.P. <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Janata </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dal </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-. `` We were all elected by the people, and now we are going back to them for their verdict on this issue.'' Government officials contend the deal was sanctioned by <PERSON> Singh </PERSON>, who at that time served as finance minister in <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s Cabinet. <PERSON> Singh </PERSON> left the governing party in 1987. The 12 opposition parties controlled 106 seats in the 544-member Lok Sabha. Besides the <ORGANIZATION> Janata </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dal </ORGANIZATION>, they include the <ORGANIZATION> Bharatiya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Janata </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Indian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-, the Telugu Desam -LRB- Party of the Telugus -RRB-, the two major Communist parties and other regional groups. The rest of the seats are controlled by <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and independents. After the auditor's report was released Tuesday, opposition members in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> shouted anti-government slogans, called <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> a thief and demanded his resignation. When he refused, they walked out and stalled proceedings for three days. The report said the arms purchase was flawed on technical considerations and cost assessment. The arms purchase has been a major scandal for <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s government because of allegations the Swedish firm <ORGANIZATION> AB </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bofors </ORGANIZATION> paid kickbacks to secure the contract Newspapers and opposition politicians say kickbacks amounting to at least $ 50 million were paid to senior government officials and to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> coffers. The allegations have never been proved. Opposition leaders have previously demanded <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s resignation on the issue, but the 44-year-old prime minister has repeatedly said he was not involved in any wrongdoing. A parliamentary committee that investigated the deal last year said there was no evidence kickbacks or commissions were paid to secure the sale. Opposition parties have been using the <ORGANIZATION> Bofors </ORGANIZATION> issue to try to merge and mount a viable challenge to <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in the general election. Their efforts have stalled in squabbling and widely publicized power struggles for nearly a year. But N.T. <PERSON> Rama </PERSON> <PERSON> Rao </PERSON>, leader of the Telugu Desam, said the decision to resign from <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> proved the opposition could unite on major issues. `` We are committed to give a clean government to the country,'' he said.

<HEAD>AIDS Cases In United States Pass 100,000 Mark</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 At least 100,000 people in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> now have AIDS. Some time in recent weeks _ nobody knows just when _ the report for the 100,000 th recorded case of AIDS in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> became part of the data files at Centers for Disease Control That case report joined hundreds of others flowing into <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> computers, where it was combined with thousands of earlier reports to eventually become part of the cumulative number of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> AIDS cases. When the monthly total for July is compiled and released in late August, <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> experts are sure that <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s official count of total AIDS cases will, for the first time, officially pass 100,000. `` Due to the backlog of reporting, plus the fact that we're retroactively going back and adding cases by the dozens, we probably reached 100,000 already,'' said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Fallis </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> spokesman But <PERSON> Fallis </PERSON>, who declined to arrange interviews with <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> epidemiology experts, said: `` There's really no way to tell which case is the 100,000 th case. Many experts, including some at <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION>, have admitted that the AIDS case total is more of a rough estimate than a precise count. But what the official total does emphasize is that there has been no retreat or slowing in the dreadful statistical march of AIDS. The nightmare is following a script of disease, illness and death that <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> epidemiology experts predicted in May 1988. By 1992, the federal agency expects there will be a cumulative total of 365,000 confirmed cases of AIDS. The agency also predicts that within three years the total number of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> residents killed by AIDS will reach 263,000 _ a total almost five times higher than the total number of Americans killed in the Vietnam War. But that's only part of the picture. In order to be counted in the official <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> survey, a patient must have a positive blood test for AIDS, plus other symptoms, such as opportunistic infections, persistent loss of weight or chronically enlarged lymph nodes. Beyond these counted patients, the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> estimates that there are 1 million to 1.5 million Americans who are infected with the AIDS virus but have not yet developed symptoms. These people are said to be seropositive. They can spread the disease, but are themselves not yet suffering its deadly effects. `` Fifty to sixty percent of people who are seropositive will develop at least some symptoms of AIDS within five years,'' said <PERSON> Fallis </PERSON>. Federal estimates of the cost of AIDS are staggering. `` Projections indicated that a total of 172,000 AIDS patients will require medical care in 1992 at a cost expected to range from $ 5 billion to $ 13 billion,'' the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> reported in May. The agency said these figures `` are underestimates of the true magnitude'' of the medical costs of the AIDS virus because many clinical treatments for the disease are not reported. Patterns of AIDS infection are slowly changing. Whereas once AIDS was almost exclusively a disease of homosexuals, the rate of discovered cases in that population group is slowing down. In the 12 months ending June 30, homosexual and bisexual males represented 57 percent of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> AIDS cases. This is a 2 percent drop from the previous 12 months. <PERSON> Fallis </PERSON> said experts believe this is because of changes in life style practices and because the population group is becoming `` saturated'' _ the number of uninfected members of this group is becoming too small to maintain the previous rate of new cases. For intravenous drug users, however, the infection rate is rising. For the 12 months ending June 30, 23 percent of the total AIDS cases were among male and female IV drug users. This is an increase of two percent from the previous 12 months. AIDS is a contagious disease that destroys immune cells and renders the body unable to resist disease. It is caused by the human immunodeficiency virus -LRB- HIV -RRB- which is spread most often through sexual intercourse with infected persons or through needles shared by intravenous drug users. Infection can also come from contaminated blood transfusions, which is rare, and babies can become infected from their mothers.''

<HEAD>Energy Secretary Struggling to Win Public Confidence in Nuclear Program</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BURNS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 As his struggle to rebuild the nation's nuclear arms industry grows more urgent, Energy Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> may be losing a grip on his most important tool: public belief that the weapons plants can be made safe Since he took office last March, <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> and a team of senior department aides have been racing against time to fix decades of neglect in the weapons program before reactor breakdowns and other problems seriously undermine <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> defense strategy. From the start, <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> believed the key to success was convincing the public _ including workers at the plants and nearby residents _ that an era of nuclear secrecy was ended, that their government could be trusted to run the plants safely. To his dismay, the cloud of mystery and distrust has only grown darker. No significant accidents have been reported at any of the 17 major weapons facilities in 12 states since <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> took over, but some have been forced to close temporarily and a series of recent incidents has raised new health and safety questions. In just the past week, for example: _ The <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s own auditors issued a blistering review of management failures and predicted that unless urgent action is taken to correct the flaws <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> will face more pressure to close the plants. It also said department employees may face criminal charges for violating environmental laws. _ The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> dispatched agents to one of the weapons plants in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> to investigate allegations of criminal violations of laws governing the handling, storage and disposal of hazardous wastes. _ The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> disclosed that it is investigating allegations of financial fraud at the same <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> plant, known as the Feed Materials Production Center, near <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>. _ The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> added seven major weapons facilities _ in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> _ to its list of the most polluted sites in the nation. _ Members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> proposed legislation that would take away from <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> some responsibilities related to the weapons program, including one measure that would transfer to the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> the authority to study and monitor the health effects of radiation on workers at the weapons plants and another that would empower an independent board to shut down any or all of the weapons plants on safety grounds. _ More environmental groups called on <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> to withdraw his choice of <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Stello </PERSON>, the controversial operations chief of the <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, to take over day-to-day administration of the nuclear weapons program. Although the Stello nomination has gained little public notice outside <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the basis of the opposition runs to the heart of <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON>' underlying dilemma. `` Secretary <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> has been conducting a public relations effort to convince the public that he is serious about environmental and safety problems at these facilities, but actions like the nomination of <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Stello </PERSON> just do n't support his words,'' said <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Costner </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, a citizen group pushing for closure of the <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> weapons plant in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>. Stello's critics contend he is not sensitive enough to health and safety issues. <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON>' struggle to erase the impression that environmental and safety problems at the weapons plants are out of control is complicated by the pressure he faces to fashion a strategy for resuming nuclear materials production at <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> and getting his waste management program off dead center. Public announcements of new waste control measures, nuclear production schedules and a blueprint for reshaping the entire weapons complex are expected sometime in August. The timing and success of <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON>' grand design is crucial. The Pentagon says it may have to cannibalize some warheads unless the <LOCATION> Savannah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> nuclear reactors resume production of tritium soon. <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON>, though, sees risk in overhauling too quickly a program the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> has called `` one of the more potentially dangerous industrial operations in the world.'' Now, with some solutions apparently in sight, <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> is being forced to fight rear-guard skirmishes with the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>, whose surprise raids this summer on the Rocky Flats plutonium processing plant in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> and the Feed Materials uranium plant in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> have undercut <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON>' efforts to sooth public safety concerns. <PERSON> Henson </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, the deputy energy secretary, and other senior department officials have expressed dismay at the unwillingness of the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> to coordinate their investigations with <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON>. `` What we do n't need is this alarming people'' about health and safety risks by springing surprise raids that create the impression that the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> thinks the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> ca n't be trusted to monitor its own facilities, <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 A higher education faculty shortage anticipated for the mid-1990s has already arrived in fields from computing to health, according to an annual survey of colleges and universities issued Sunday. Half the institutions in the survey by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> said it is taking them longer now to find qualified people for full-time faculty positions than it was previously. Half also said they are having greater difficulty getting top applicants to accept positions when they are offered _ up from 25 percent who gave that response in 1987. <PERSON> Elaine </PERSON> <PERSON> El-Khawas </PERSON>, an ACE vice president and author of `` Campus Trends, 1989,'' noted that some studies have projected shortages in the next decade but said her research indicates a more immediate problem. `` The labor market for faculty is tightening right now,'' she said. `` The real dilemmas for colleges are going to be starting much sooner than 1995.'' <PERSON> El-Khawas </PERSON> said factors contributing to the problem include an inadequate number of doctorate holders, an increasing number of Ph.D. s going into private industry, a greater proportion of doctoral degrees earned by foreigners, accelerating retirement of faculty members, and expanding student enrollment The sixth annual ACE survey of senior academic administrators at 366 institutions found that 40 percent are having trouble finding qualified people for full-time positions in computer science. One in three institutions reported similar problems in the business area. Mathematics and health professions each were cited by one in four schools. Half the administrators surveyed said they expect the pace of retirement among full-time faculty to increase in the next few years. At the same time, half said the size of their full-time faculty had grown in the last year and 71 percent said they had increased their overall enrollment. <PERSON> El-Khawas </PERSON> said the crunch may result in pressure for higher salaries in certain fields, incentives to keep people from retiring and a highly competitive situation where universities are trying to entice faculty members away from each other. Class size may also be affected, she said. The 1989 survey indicates there may be an impact in that area already. One-third of colleges and universities reported an increase in average class size, up from 20 percent in the 1988 survey. The physical condition of universities is also a pressing concern, according to the survey. Only 32 percent of the administrators felt their physical plant was excellent or very good. Another third said plant renovation and renewal will be a key challenge in the next five years and more than half predicted their facilities will not be adequate to meet school needs over the next decade. On another front, eight in 10 institutions reported at least some activity to increase the enrollment and retention of minority students. However, only 25 percent said their enrollment of blacks, Hispanics and Asians had risen during 1988-89 and only 10 percent reported an increase in American Indian students. `` It's encouraging that there's a tremendous level of activity,'' <PERSON> El-Khawas </PERSON> said. `` But the actual results fall short.'' The same proportion of institutions reported they were making special efforts to increase minority faculty members. But only 17 percent offer incentives to academic departments to hire minorities and only 25 percent reported a net gain in minority faculty over the previous year. The ACE survey found continuing interest in assessments of student learning, with 40 percent of the activity reportedly in response to external mandates. Basic skills testing is in place at 65 percent of schools and an additional 19 percent are planning such tests. Half of colleges and universities now assess writing and 27 percent report that writing assessment is in the planning stages. Close to half are planning to assess students' critical thinking skills and 14 percent already do so. About half the administrators responding to the survey said they believe assessment will `` significantly improve'' undergraduate education. But 37 percent said that so far, the process has resulted mainly in new reporting requirements to the state. ACE is the umbrella group for the nation's colleges and universities. Its campus trends survey, based on responses from 366 campuses, was adjusted statistically to be representative of the country's 2,500 general institutions of higher education. Seminaries, art schools, stand-alone graduate schools and other specialized institutions were not included. The margin of error for the survey was 2 percent.

<HEAD>Gorbachev Says Miners' Strikes Inspiring</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said Sunday he was `` inspired'' by striking coal miners and understood why they were skeptical about a government offer to end their eight-day walkout. But <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> told Soviet television he disagreed with the tactics used by many of the nation's 1 million coal miners and said their strike could threaten the national economy if it does not end. He appealed to miners and `` all the workers of the country'' to endure the disruption caused by his reforms and help the nation find `` the wide road of our society's renewal.'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, seeking to show sympathy toward the strikers while encouraging them to return to work, said he could understand why miners in the <LOCATION> Donetsk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Basin </LOCATION> voted Saturday to turn down a government offer that met most of their demands. The miners said they wanted assurances authorities would live up to the offer. `` People, to some extent, have lost their trust,'' said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. By striking, he said, the miners acted `` very sharply,'' but their actions showed `` workers are basically taking matters into their own hands, and that, despite all the drama of these events, makes me greatly inspired.'' A strike leader in the <LOCATION> Donetsk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Basin </LOCATION>, the nation's largest coal center, said miners there would appeal to the Soviet legislature for legal guarantees to back government promises aimed at ending their walkout, which began July 15. <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> Balandin </PERSON>, a member of the <LOCATION> Donetsk </LOCATION> regional strike committee, said a delegation of miners was scheduled to speak Monday to the Supreme Soviet, the standing legislature. More than 5,000 strikers demonstrated Sunday on the central square in the city of <LOCATION> Donetsk </LOCATION>, 900 miles south of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, and miners at each pit were deciding for themselves whether to resume work, he said in a telephone interview. The region has 121 pits with an annual production of 210 million tons. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported Sunday that 74 of the mines remained on strike, 29 fewer than on Saturday. On Saturday, press reports said about 300,000 miners in <LOCATION> Donetsk </LOCATION> were on strike. The stoppage is the biggest of a wave of miners' strikes that began July 11 in western <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION> and spread from the <LOCATION> Arctic </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. Miners reportedly remained on strike at 11 of the 13 mines in <LOCATION> Vorkuta </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Pechora </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Basin </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Arctic </LOCATION> and at all 12 mines in <LOCATION> Chervonograd </LOCATION> in the western <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION>. The Donetsk regional strike committee reached a general agreement with government negotiators Saturday, but most miners there rejected it, saying they did not trust the government to fulfill its promises of better working and living conditions. <PERSON> Balandin </PERSON> said the government commission `` guaranteed its concessions, but that's a small guarantee, and people do n't believe in it.'' The Supreme Soviet could give the agreement `` the force of law,'' he said. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and Prime Minister <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> assured strikers in a telegram Saturday that their demands `` would be urgently reviewed by the Supreme Soviet and <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministers </ORGANIZATION>, with participation by representatives of the miners, to reach the necessary decisions.'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> repeated those assurances in the interview Sunday with a TV journalist. The interview was nationally broadcast. The coal strikes have caused dire difficulties for power and steel industries, among others, Soviet press reports say. At the strike's peak, reports indicated half the coal industry's 1 million workers were on strike Journalist <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Makarsky </PERSON> said in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Donetsk </LOCATION> that the strike settlement there included earlier pension eligibility, pay increases and longer vacations, with extra holidays for miners in especially difficult or dangerous conditions. Miners in two major coal centers, the <LOCATION> Karaganda </LOCATION> region of the Central Asian republic of <LOCATION> Kazakhstan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Kuznetsk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Basin </LOCATION> of western <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION>, have gone back into the pits but say they will strike again if the government reneges on its promises. The Siberian miners returned to work Thursday and Friday after they were promised pay increases, more consumer goods and greater control over their industry.

 Communist guerrillas on Sunday renewed their offer to declare a truce if President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> promises to close <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bases here by 1991. <PERSON> Satur </PERSON> <PERSON> Ocampo </PERSON>, who negotiated for the Communist-led <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> in peace talks more than two years ago, also claimed in a statement that Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s government has committed more human rights violations than <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' government. The statement was delivered to news agencies one day before the opening of a session of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, at which Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> was to deliver her State of the Nation address. The rebels first offered in April to observe a cease-fire if Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> promised to close the bases, but she replied that the Communists were not in a position to impose conditions. `` Although summarily rejected by the Aquino regime, determined as it is to retain the bases, this offer remains a firm proposal of the <ORGANIZATION> NDF </ORGANIZATION> before the nation,'' <PERSON> Ocampo </PERSON> said. The lease on six <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military installations in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> expires in 1991. The constitution bans all foreign bases in the country after that year unless permitted by a treaty ratified by two-thirds of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, where opposition to the bases is strong. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have been pushing for early talks on extension of the bases' lease. In the rebel statement, <PERSON> Ocampo </PERSON> said Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> `` is set to go along'' with the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> wishes. `` The <ORGANIZATION> NDF </ORGANIZATION> calls on all patriotic Filipinos to oppose and frustrate, through all possible means, the criminal plan to retain the imperialist military bases in the country,'' he said.

<TEXT>
 A 161.4 percent jump in drug convictions paced a 48.7 percent increase in defendants found guilty of federal crimes between 1980 and 1987, the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Sunday. Results of a study showed that by 1987 a larger proportion of convicted defendants received prison terms from federal judges and their sentences were on average 11 months longer than those imposed in 1980, the department said. The number of criminal defendants convicted in federal courts nationwide increased from 29,943 in 1980 to 44,518 percent in 1987, according to a study prepared by the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION>. The conviction rate for defendants prosecuted in federal courts increased from 76 percent in 1980 to 81 percent in 1987, the study said. Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said in a statement that the figures demonstrated the need for more money to build additional prisons to house the increasing numbers of convicted defendants sent behind bars by federal judges. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has proposed spending $ 1.5 billion to add 24,000 beds to the overcrowded federal prison system. Federal judges sent 13,766 convicted defendants to prison in 1980 and ordered the imprisonment of 23,579 in 1987, the study said. The proportion of criminal defendants sentenced to prison increased from 46 percent in 1980 to 53 percent in 1987 and the average term of incarceration grew by 11 months between the two years, the study said. During this period, the average sentence for federal crimes increased from 44.3 months in 1980 to 55.2 months in 1987, the study said. The number of defendants convicted of drug offenses increased 161.4 percent from 5,135 to 13,423, according to the study, which was based on figures from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorneys' offices and the Administrative Office of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Courts. The average sentence for drug offenders was 21 months longer in 1987 than it was in 1980. The average sentence for non-drug crimes was only two months longer in 1987 than in 1980. By far, the category of drug crimes showed the biggest increase in the number of defendants convicted in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> district courts, followed by a 55.1 percent increase in people convicted of fraud, forgery and counterfeiting. Convictions for offenses such as tax fraud, racketeering, extortion and weapons violations increased 21.9 percent during the period. `` These figures indicate that the federal criminal justice system has responded forcefully to the increase in crime, especially in the area of drug trafficking,'' <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said.

 The bride and groom needed a police escort to escape a wedding reception brawl that forced officers to call for reinforcements and left 15 guests facing charges. Before the rice could be thrown, metal folding chairs flew and the parking lot at the Elk's Lodge was littered with confetti and paper streamers, beer cans, six high-heeled shoes, two pairs of sunglasses, and the couple's `` Just Married'' sign. The police escort for the couple after the Saturday incident included six cruisers with lights flashing and sirens wailing. The 15 guests were arrested on charges of disorderly conduct, assault and battery, malicious damage, resisting arrest and obstructing police. The first police who responded radioed for more help. State and municipal police from all over central <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> began converging on the city. Neighbors saw a disheveled young man run from the lodge as the first officers arrived. Police caught up with him in a nearby backyard and led him away in handcuffs, neighbors said. Police did not offer any explanation of what caused the fight or how it got started. They also declined to name the bride and groom. `` One kid started it all,'' said a bartender who was washing glasses once the hall was empty. `` One kid got 60 people going.''

<HEAD>Poll Finds Opposition to Anti-Abortion Candidates</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Americans favor legal abortion in their states by a 2-1 margin, and nearly four in 10 say they are inclined to oppose anti-abortion candidates for state office, a national poll has found. With the battle over abortion increasingly focused on state legislatures, voters critical of anti-abortion candidates outnumbered their supporters by nearly 2-1 in the <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General-Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> survey. Respondents also expressed continued support for the 1973 <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling establishing a constitutional right to abortion. Fifty-nine percent were in favor and 36 percent were opposed, with 5 percent unsure. Support for the 1973 decision was slightly up from 53 percent in an MG-AP survey in March. While the increase was within the poll's margin of sampling error, similar movement in other questions indicated a slight rise in pro-choice sentiment since the court approved greater abortion restrictions on July 3 Sixty-three percent in the new poll said they would want abortion to be legal in their state if the court overturned its 1973 ruling and let each state make its own abortion laws. That was up from 57 percent in March. The survey, conducted by telephone July 7-16 among 1,163 adults, had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points. While majorities favored legal abortion generally, respondents were split on many of the specific restrictions in the court's July 3 ruling. Among the findings: _ Sixty-five percent said it should be legal for abortions to be done at public hospitals, but that fell to 51 percent when respondents were asked specifically about abortions that are not required to save the mother's life The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> said states can ban such abortions from public hospitals. _ Respondents split about evenly on whether it should be legal for public health employees to perform or assist in abortions The court said that, too, can be barred by the states when the mother's life is not at risk _ Respondents strongly supported mandatory pre-abortion tests to see if fetuses that are at least 20 weeks old can survive outside the womb, with 62 percent in favor The high court said such tests may be required. _ By 54-38 percent, with 8 percent undecided, respondents said it should be legal to use public funds to counsel women about the availability of abortion The court left that issue undecided. Overall, 48 percent of respondents said they opposed the July 3 ruling, 43 percent favored it and 9 percent were unsure. That was a split in opinion, given the margin of error. Pro-choice activists have said they will work to defeat anti-abortion state legislators. In the survey, 38 percent said they would be less likely to vote for a candidate who was firmly opposed to abortion, compared with 21 percent who would be more likely to support such a candidate. An additional 38 percent said it would n't matter much and 3 percent were unsure. At the same time, two-thirds of the respondents said they would not base their vote just on a candidate's position on abortion. As in other polls, general questions on abortion produced divided views, reflecting public discomfort with an issue that pits the rights of pregnant women against concern for their fetuses. On one hand, 67 percent said a woman should be allowed to have an abortion if she wants one and her doctor agrees to it, and just 25 percent said not, with 8 percent undecided. On the other hand, a sizable 42 percent favored a constitutional amendment to ban most abortions. Fifty-three percent opposed an amendment and the rest were undecided. As in past surveys, younger, more educated and wealthier people were more apt to support legal abortion, as were residents of the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION> and the West and big-city dwellers. People who called themselves conservatives were far more likely to oppose abortion. Just 42 percent of conservatives supported the court's 1973 ruling, compared with 66 percent of moderates and 80 percent of liberals. <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a communications company based in <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, publishes the Richmond Times-Dispatch, the Richmond News Leader, the <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION> -RRB- <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> Winston-Salem </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION> -RRB- Journal, and operates TV stations <ORGANIZATION> WXFL </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, WCBD in <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> WJKS </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla </LOCATION>.

 This <ORGANIZATION> Media </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General-Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> poll is based on telephone interviews July 7-16 with 1,163 adults in the continental <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Phone numbers were selected randomly and interviews were conducted with the adult in the household who had the most recent birthday, a random variable. The results were weighted to adjust for variations in the sample. The poll has a three-point margin of error, meaning that 19 of 20 times its findings should be within 3 points of the result if every adult American were asked the same questions. The error margin is larger for subgroups; it is five points for people who called themselves conservatives, for example. There are other sources of potential error in polls, including the wording and order of questions. These are the questions in this poll; because of rounding, sums may not total 100: 1. If a woman wants to have an abortion and her doctor agrees to it, should she be allowed to have an abortion, or not? Yes: 67 percent. No: 25 percent. Do n't know or no answer: 8 percent. 2. Would you vote for or against a candidate just on the basis of that candidate's position on the abortion issue? Yes: 32. No: 61. DK-NA: 7. 3. If a candidate for your state legislature is firmly opposed to abortion, would that make you more likely to vote for that candidate, or less likely, or would n't it matter much? More: 21. Less: 38. Would n't matter: 38. DK-NA: 3. 4a. Should it be legal or illegal for abortions to be done at public hospitals? Legal: 65. Illegal: 26. DK-NA: 9. b -LRB- If legal -RRB- Does that include abortions that are not necessary to save the mother's life? Yes: 78. No: 18. DK-NA: 4. 5a. Should it be legal or illegal or public health employees to perform or assist in abortions? Legal: 44. Illegal: 43. DK-NA: 13. b -LRB- If legal -RRB- Does that include abortions that are not necessary to save the mother's life? Yes: 90. No: 9. DK-NA: 2. 6. Should it be legal or illegal to use public funds to counsel women about the availability of abortion? Legal: 54. Illegal: 38. DK-NA: 8. 7. If a woman who is at least 20 weeks pregnant wants an abortion, should the doctor first be required to determine whether the fetus can survive outside the womb, or not? Yes: 62. No: 21. DK-NA: 17. 8a. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> this month gave the states more power to restrict abortions. Do you favor or oppose that ruling? Favor: 43. Oppose 48. DK-NA: 9. b -LRB- If oppose -RRB- Is that because you wanted the court to do more to restrict abortions, or because you think the court did too much to restrict abortions? Wanted more: 8. Too much: 86. DK-NA: 7. 9. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled in 1973 that a woman can have an abortion if she wants one at any time during the first three months of pregnancy. Do you favor or oppose that ruling? Favor: 59. Oppose: 36. DK-NA: 5. 10. If the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> reversed its 1973 ruling and let each state make its own abortion laws, abortion could become legal in some states and illegal in others. Would you want abortion to be legal or illegal in your state? Legal: 63. Illegal: 31. DK-NA: 7. 11. If abortion was illegal in your state, do you think that would stop most women there who want abortions from having them, or would most of them go to another state where it was legal? Stop: 7. Go: 87. DK-NA: 6. 12. Would you favor or oppose a constitutional amendment that would make abortions illegal nationwide, except in cases of rape, incest or to save the life of the mother? Favor: 42. Oppose: 53. DK-NA: 6.

 <PERSON> Felix </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> takes a break from sawing beams out of a laurel log to sit in the shade of a mango tree and tell how life has improved since his cooperative farm was expropriated from a landowner nine years ago. <PERSON> Orlando </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Sola </PERSON> sits in an overstuffed leather chair in a gleaming white mansion and laments that his land and hundreds of other big spreads were taken away and given to `` freeloaders.'' The two men exemplify a dilemma facing the month-old rightist government of President <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON>: how to deal with a land reform program that is anathema to the right but is too deeply rooted to abolish. Since 1980, the reform program has redistributed nearly 30 percent of this Massachusetts-sized country's arable acreage. About 120,000 peasant families have taken part in the program, which was designed by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> academics and pushed by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policymakers as necessary to erode support for leftist revolution. In all, 469 big farms were expropriated, with compensation that many landlords say was insufficient. The farms were organized into 320 cooperatives, of which about 50 have failed for economic reasons or because they were in war zones. Agriculture Minister <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Cabrales </PERSON> says only 10 percent of the remaining co-ops are profitable. Critics of the reform program say the co-ops have reduced production and that peasants not accustomed to managing large enterprises have been unable to run the farms. Although the reform's economic outcome is uncertain, it has been a political asset for the U.S.-backed government in its 10-year-old civil war with Marxist-led insurgents. Peasant organizations, the centrist <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> and leftists now contend <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>, or <PERSON> Arena </PERSON>, plans to undo land reform without appearing to do so. <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> and Cabrales reject the accusations and say the intent is `` to reform the reform'' _ to improve production by letting peasant farmers themselves decide how they want to work the land. While <PERSON> Felix </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> is fighting to retain his land, <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Sola </PERSON> says the government is not moving quickly enough to dismantle the reform. He says <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> is being `` a sissy.'' Twenty-one former landowners are trying to get their land back through the overwhelmingly conservative courts. All five cases decided so far have gone against the peasants. <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON>'s cooperative is one of those five. `` We made her tons of money,'' <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> said of <PERSON> Victoria </PERSON> <PERSON> Amada </PERSON> <PERSON> Sol </PERSON>, former owner of <LOCATION> Hacienda </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nueva </LOCATION>. `` Now we're doing quite well,'' he said, enumerating the improvements since the farm was converted into a cooperative in 1980. `` I have worked this land for 40 years. Under ` la patrona' -LRB- the former owner -RRB- we broke our backs for 20 cents a day. That was enough for us to eat. But clothes, or shoes _ forget it.'' <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON>, 68, exhibited his calloused hands as he spoke. He explained that though he now could buy shoes, he never got used to the idea, and his leathery splayed feet remain bare. Each of the adobe brick and thatch - or tin-roofed houses of the farm's 600 families has a large concrete basin with running water All have electricity. The cooperative has a school with two teachers and pays a doctor at a clinic in <LOCATION> Lourdes </LOCATION>, 12 miles west of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. The farm is made up of rolling coffee-covered hills and rippling flat streches of corn and sugar cane. In the summer rainy season, it displays every shade of green from lime to dark ivy. It is beautiful and bountiful, and Mrs. Sol wants it back. She took her case to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, which ruled that the land had been unlawfully expropriated. The conservative court likewise ruled in favor of four other plaintiffs who argued that their holdings had not exceeded the 1,235-acre limit established by the reform. Mrs. Sol's lawyers said they could not comment on the ongoing case. Mrs. Sol, who lives in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, did not return a phone call seeking comment. Despite the court decisions, the Arena government seems unwilling to pay the political cost of forced evictions. The court has issued an eviction order only in the case of <LOCATION> Hacienda </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nueva </LOCATION>. It was effective June 23, but the government has taken no action. <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON> and Cabrales, the agriculture minister, have said force will not be used. Authorities are trying to negotiate a solution, which may mean higher government compensation for Mrs. Sol or a swap that would set up the cooperative on new land.

 Hundreds of thousands of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> residents have fled escalating shelling between <LOCATION> Syrian </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> gunners, and police said duels Sunday left six people dead and at least 20 wounded. `` If I stay I'll go crazy,'' said 23-year-old <PERSON> Radwa </PERSON> <PERSON> Succar </PERSON>, a Moslem beautician who joined the exodus to south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. `` If we do n't get killed from bombardment, we'll definitely die from fear and depression.'' By police count, at least 250,000 Moslem and <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> residents since Friday had taken advantage of brief lulls in the fighting to pack and flee. Tens of thousands of others from <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and nearby towns huddled in basements and bomb shelters for the third straight day, with no electricity and little water. `` This is a life of animals. Living in bomb shelters is not a joyful thing at all,'' said <PERSON> Chafika </PERSON> <PERSON> Maalouf </PERSON>, a 63-year-old Christian homemaker, as she left suburban <PERSON> Zalka </PERSON> with her husband, son and daughter-in-law. `` I simply ca n't take it anymore.'' <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> was a ghost town, bereft of Sunday strollers and most traffic. The few open sidewalk cafes were nearly empty. Gunners hit a fuel tanker north of the city, setting it on fire, and Syrian tanks blasted a Christian army position they surrounded in hills outside <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. Police said Christian forces fired mortars at Druse towns in the central mountains to try to ease the pressure on their garrison at the strategic hilltop town of <LOCATION> Souk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> el-Gharb </LOCATION>, 15 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. Syrian and <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> forces also traded machine-gun fire across <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s Green Line, forcing the closure of the only public crossing between the Moslem and <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> sectors. One Syrian tank shell hit the house of a Christian family in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s eastern suburb of <PERSON> Hadath </PERSON>, killing a 7-year-old girl, her 10-year-old brother and her grandfather, a police spokesman said. The children's parents and another brother were in intensive care in a Christian hospital, said the spokesman, who can not be named under standing regulations. Among other wounded were two soldiers of Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s mainly Christian force and four Druse militiamen, the spokesman said The new casualities raised the overall toll to 446 killed and 1,856 wounded since the latest round of fighting in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s 14-year-old civil war erupted March 8, pitting <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s 20,000 troops against the Syrian army and the Druse militia Police said the fighting eased around midday only to pick up more violently in the afternoon. Police identified the stricken vessel as the Greek-registered <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Argo </PERSON> and said it was carrying 2,000 tons of gasoline to the besieged Christian region when it was hit by shellfire six miles offshore. The ship sailed toward open seas after the bombardment, but police said it was intercepted by a Syrian gunboat and escorted to the Syrian-controlled port of <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION> in north <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. No casualties were reported. It was the sixth vessel to be struck by Syrian shellfire. The Syrians, who consider control of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> vital to their security, maintain 40,000 troops in 75 percent of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> under a 1976 peacekeeping mandate from the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> charges the Syrians have destroyed that mandate by openly fighting on the Moslem side. He has pledged to drive them from <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Plan Would Offer Health Care for All, Set National Spending Cap</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NANCY BENAC</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The head of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Select </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Aging on Sunday proposed an overhaul of the government's health care system that would offer coverage to all Americans and cap overall spending for medical care. Rep. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Roybal </PERSON>, D-Calif., said he would introduce legislation Monday to provide medical coverage to the 37 million Americans who now are uninsured and to improve benefits for the 200 million people, or 85 percent of Americans, who are underinsured against catastrophic long-term illness In addition, the legislation for the first time would set a cap on the nation's total spending for health care, limiting expenditures to 12 percent of the gross national product, the broadest measure of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic activity. <PERSON> Roybal </PERSON>'s plan is among many that have been proposed to establish a comprehensive health care program for the nation that would better protect uninsured and underinsured Americans. From 1980 through 1987, health care costs rose at an average rate of 10.4 percent, or 3.3 percent faster than the GNP. Under the current system, these costs are expected to reach 13 percent of GNP by 1995 and nearly 15 percent by the year 2000. `` We are facing a serious crisis in our nation's health care system because of incomplete access to care, and increasing costs of care,'' <PERSON> Roybal </PERSON> said. `` Soaring health care costs in the current system threaten the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people's ability to pay for desperately needed health care.'' Under the proposed legislation, payments by beneficiaries would be limited to: 20 percent of health care, skilled nursing home and home health costs, up to a maximum of $ 600 a person per year; and 25 percent of long-term care costs, up to a maximum of $ 1,000 per person a year. Both maximums would rise in tandem with per capita growth in the GNP. The expanded benefits would be paid for by extending the <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> payroll tax to all income, an employer tax based on compensation, an expanded cigarette tax, state revenues covering half the costs for the poor, a surcharge on corporate and individual income taxes and a premium paid by the elderly approximating the current <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> premium. The legislation, which would modify the existing Medicare program and take full effect in 1994, would establish a cost-containment program that includes fixed fee schedules for health care providers and limiting future increases to the rise in the per capita GNP.

 When the ruling council of the nation's largest <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> tribe voted Chairman <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> out of office amid corruption allegations more than five months ago, it set off a dispute that exploded in violence last week. An estimated 300 club-wielding <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> supporters clashed with <LOCATION> Navajo </LOCATION> tribal police Thursday in <LOCATION> Window </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION>, the 200,000-member tribe's capital. Two people were killed and nine wounded in the violence, the latest episode in the struggle for power on the 125,000 square-mile <ORGANIZATION> Navajo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reservation </ORGANIZATION>, which extends over parts of <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>. The tribal capital was quiet Sunday as many of the council members and protesters left for the weekend because their homes are several hours from Window Rock, officials said. On Saturday, interim Navajo Tribal Attorney General <PERSON> Herb </PERSON> <PERSON> Yazzie </PERSON> called for the federal government to indict <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> on corruption charges and for the tribal prosecutor's office to charge <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> with violating tribal law. Those killed in Thursday's violence were members of the Pro-Dineh Voters organization, which exists to return <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> to power. Three police officers were among the nine wounded. The tribal <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> was a <ORGANIZATION> MacDonald </ORGANIZATION> ally for most of the three months during which he fought efforts of the new administration to evict him from the tribe's administration building. That changed near the end of April, as Interim Chairman <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Haskie </PERSON> pursued a policy of erosion _ leaving <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> on an island of power while taking control of the tribe's purse strings and winning federal and judicial recognition. <PERSON> Haskie </PERSON> succeeded in replacing the police chief. Under new leadership, officers on May 24 cleared <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> loyalists out of the offices where they had slept to prevent just such a takeover. Lt. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON> led the sweep, and observers said it was no accident that an attack on <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON> precipitated the fracas Thursday with tribal police coming to his defense. The violence was not the first in the controversy. Early on, a <ORGANIZATION> MacDonald </ORGANIZATION> supporter attacked another man with a knife outside the Tribal Council Building. In early April, <PERSON> Haskie </PERSON> backers marched on successive weekends to <LOCATION> Window </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> supporters were waiting. During the second demonstration, police threw tear gas to disperse the crowd. Amid the larger confrontations, incidents of shouting, name-calling and bad feelings occurred almost daily. In the council's Feb. 13 action against <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON>, 49 of the 88 council members voted to place the chairman on administrative leave for investigation of claims that his fourth term was marred by corruption. Although <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> has not been charged with a crime, testimony delivered at January hearings of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Select </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Indian Affairs swayed many Navajos against him. Witnesses described a system of government in which contractors seeking on-reservation work were forced to pay thousands of dollars in kickbacks. Others testified that <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> shared in the $ 7.2 million profit turned by two non-Indian businessmen who bought a ranch and sold it to the tribe less than 24 hours later. But the council insurgents overlooked the Navajos' respect for <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON>'s leadership qualities, resolute nature and his charisma. Many traditionalists rallied behind <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> regardless of the legal or ethical issues. <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> knew how to play on the passions of his backers, says <PERSON> Duane </PERSON> <PERSON> Beyal </PERSON>, <PERSON> Haskie </PERSON>'s press aide. `` He's got a silver tongue. There's no denying that,'' <PERSON> Beyal </PERSON> said in an interview in Window Rock last April. `` In that way, he follows in the tradition of the great chiefs. But not in the other ways.'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Chapela </PERSON>, a Window Rock lawyer, said <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON>'s magnetism was so strong it could only be countered by videotapes of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> hearings. <PERSON> Chapela </PERSON> said he taped the procedure and visited about one-fourth of the Navajo chapters, or political wards, to show voters who might have missed the televised sessions. <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> was marshaling his own support. Within days of his suspension, he began visiting the chapters to outline his contention that Indian leaders had accepted gifts since the dawn of tribal structure as a way to cement friendships for the tribe. His dealings were no different, <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> said. <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON>'s fortunes waned as <PERSON> Haskie </PERSON>'s brightened with a series of legal victories, including an order from a tribal judge restraining <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> from acting in an official capacity. <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> says it is n't over. `` There will be more violence,'' he said Friday.

 Six Greek Cypriot women alleged Sunday that they were molested and beaten by Turkish Cypriot prison guards and police after being arrested for taking part in a protest last week. `` They treated us like animals,'' <PERSON> Georgia </PERSON> <PERSON> Petrou </PERSON>, 19, told reporters after she and the five other women emerged from the Turkish Cypriot prison where they had been held four days. All six showed black bruises on their bodies they said were from beatings by Turkish Cypriot police. Several hundred Greek Cypriots were in the fourth day of a sit-in outside the headquarters of the 2,300-man <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping force at <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION> airport, which lies on the Green Line dividing the island into the Greek and Turkish sectors. They were demanding freedom for 108 Greek Cypriots _ 98 women and 10 men _ arrested by <LOCATION> Turkish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cypriot </LOCATION> police Wednesday when they stormed across the U.N.-patrolled buffer zone to protest the Turkish occupation of northern <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>. The issue threatens to wreck talks between leaders of the rival communities aimed at reunifying the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> island. Government spokesman <PERSON> Akis </PERSON> <PERSON> Fantis </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> will meet in closed session in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> on Monday to discuss the issue. A district court in the Turkish-held sector of <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION> convicted the 108 Greek Cypriots of violating the border of the <LOCATION> Turkish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, which only <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> recognizes. Ninety-two women and the 10 men were given sentences of two or three days in jail and were fined from $ 100 to $ 200 each. Sixteen young women were given suspended sentences, but only six were freed. The others refused to sign court documents promising not to commit the same crime again and will remain in jail. They said signing the statement would have implied recognition of the court's legitimacy The protesters faced a maximum penalty of 18 months and hefty fines. But Judge <PERSON> Gonul </PERSON> <PERSON> Orenen </PERSON> said she was passing `` very lenient'' sentences to prevent further deterioration in relations between the two communities. <PERSON> Margarita </PERSON> <PERSON> Michail </PERSON>, an 18-year-old women who was released, broke down and sobbed as she talked about her detainment. `` We were pulled by the hair and our clothes, punched and kicked and the Turkish policemen who arrested us grabbed our breasts and genitals,'' she said. Others said they were verbally abused and spat on by a crowd of Turkish Cypriot men and women while waiting to be taken into detention after their arrest. Ms. <PERSON> Petrou </PERSON> said they spent the first night on the ground in a sports complex. The following nights they slept on the floor of a detention center with 40 people per room and only 18 beds. `` The women wardens terrorized us telling us they would turn us over to men to be raped,'' she said. Turkish Cypriot leader <PERSON> Rauf </PERSON> <PERSON> Denktash </PERSON> and President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Vassiliou </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> are scheduled to meet Wednesday for another round in their 10 months of U.N.-sponsored talks on reunifying the island. But <PERSON> Denktash </PERSON> has said he may not attend because of the crisis. <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Camilion </PERSON>, special respresentative of <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON>, drove across the Green Line for talks with <PERSON> Denktash </PERSON>. The northern third of <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> was seized by the Turkish army when it invaded July 20, 1974, following a short-lived coup in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION> by supporters of union with <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>. An estimated 35,000 Turkish troops guard the Turkish sector.

 The Internal Revenue Service, often called on to defend its competence, will face a new challenge this week: defending its integrity. The House Government Operations subcommittee on consumer affairs opens three days of hearings Tuesday into what Chairman <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnard </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, D-Ga., called `` serious misconduct problems among senior managers of <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> and a culture within the service that glorifies the agency's public image at the expense of aggressive investigation and punishment of wrongdoing. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON>, the new <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> commissioner, said the agency's criminal investigation system works pretty well But he and his predecessor have refused to discuss the subcommittee's investigation, citing a privacy-protection law that imposes criminal penalties on anyone who discloses information about individual tax files Some members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> accuse the agency of hiding behind the law, which was toughened after disclosures that <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> administration officials tried to use the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> to punish political enemies. The subcommittee has been on the investigation for more than a year, checking events as far back as 1984. The most notable case involves bribery allegations against <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Saranow </PERSON>, former chief of the agency's criminal investigation division in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. He was alleged to have been bribed by officials of jeans manufacturer <ORGANIZATION> Guess </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, to launch an investigation of rival <ORGANIZATION> Jordache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprises </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> last year cleared Saranow of wrongdoing. <PERSON> Barnard </PERSON>'s investigators say the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> not only disregarded important testimony against <PERSON> Saranow </PERSON> but leaked information to him while he was still under investigation. <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> conduct also is drawing the attention of Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. He said Saturday that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> needs to assign a small group of staffers to do nothing but oversee <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> operations. `` You get into trouble with an agency when you have no checks and balances _ no oversight in the administration of it,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said in a televised interview prepared for broadcast in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. His Finance Committee staff said it is difficult for the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> commissioner to watch over operations of an agency that has more than 80 field offices and employees in every state. Although the privacy statute can require <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to overcome substantia hurdles in monitoring the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION>, it should not be changed because `` it provides valuable safeguards to <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> taxpayers,'' the committee staff said in a memo to <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> cited the privacy statue in denying <PERSON> Barnard </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee access to taxpayer files. He threatened to take the fight to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> but back down because of all-out opposition from Rep. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ill </LOCATION>., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Under the law, only Ways and Means, <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Taxation </ORGANIZATION>, on which <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON> share leadership, may see taxpayer files. In announcing the hearing, <PERSON> Barnard </PERSON> said his subcommittee has `` reason to believe that many changes are necessary at'' <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> if Americans are to be believe that the tax laws are being administered fairly. <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON> and his top administrators say they are as ready to take any advice as they are unwilling to discuss specific allegations. `` We are wide open for considering anything they have to suggest. The fact that there is somebody out there skimming money leads you to the conclusion that something is wrong,'' <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON> said. `` Changes are already being made,'' added <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>, senior deputy commissioner. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Milburn </PERSON>, assistant commissioner for criminal investigation, defends the 3,200 special agents assigned to probe allegations of criminality as the most thorough in the world. Because these agents are such professionals, he said, smart defense lawyers often attempt to undermine a case by casting doubt on the integrity of the investigator. `` Our integrity is the only asset we being to our job,'' he said. <PERSON> Teddy </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kern </PERSON>, assistant commissioner for inspection, who is in charge of monitoring the conduct of <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> employees, said that in 1987, 88 of <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION>' 120,000 employees were convicted of criminal charges following internal investigations. He noted with satisfaction that <PERSON> Barnard </PERSON> has acknowledged that the subcommittee probe has not uncovered widespread wrongdoing. `` Anybody who is anticipating a HUD-type situation,'' said <PERSON> Kern </PERSON>, referring to widespread influence-peddling in the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> during the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, `` is going to be disappointed.''

 The murder trial of a man who led police on the biggest manhunt in <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> history has captivated residents of this Ozarks community, who lived in fear for two months in 1987 before his capture. From restaurants to beauty parlors, residents of this college town of 13,000 are buzzing about the trial of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, 35, became almost a folk hero, inspiring songs and T-shirts, by managing to elude an army of more than 250 law officers, bloodhounds and helicopters in the surrounding dense forests before his May 28, 1987, capture by <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents at an <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> motel. He is charged with murdering a volunteer at a church in <LOCATION> Doolittle </LOCATION>, four miles west of <LOCATION> Rolla </LOCATION>, during the two-month manhunt. The trial in <LOCATION> Phelps </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Circuit </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Court </LOCATION>, where all 100 seats in the courtroom were filled throughout last week, was to begin its second week Monday. `` It's the talk of my shop,'' beauty shop operator <PERSON> Lola </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> said last week. `` There's still a question mark in some people's minds whether he's a murderer or not They definitely feel he's a criminal, like I do. `` He had us scared there for a long time.'' The trial was delayed for months by various motions and by lack of funding in the public defender's office to pay for <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>'s defense `` Personally, I think he's guilty,'' said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Missouri-Rolla </ORGANIZATION> student lunching in a fast-food restaurant with friends. `` I'm getting tired of hearing about him, though, and I know others are, too.'' Assistant state attorney general <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Finnical </PERSON>, who is seeking the death penalty, contends that <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> shot <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Long </PERSON>, 56, at the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Apostolic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> on April 1, 1987, and then stole the victim's car At the time, police were hunting <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> for allegedly wounding a <LOCATION> Rolla </LOCATION> police officer two days earlier in a motel parking lot. Much of <PERSON> Finnical </PERSON>'s evidence is circumstantial, as there were no witnesses to <PERSON> Long </PERSON>'s slaying. However, <PERSON> Finnical </PERSON> said four ballistics experts will testify that a .357 - caliber Magnum revolver <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> carried when he was arrested was the same gun used to kill <PERSON> Finnical </PERSON> also produced several witnesses who had known or been robbed by <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, who had been on the loose since escaping from a southwest <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> prison in 1984, where he was serving a four-year sentence for burglary and possessing explosive weapons. The manhunt for him began, however, only after the police officer was shot. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Brad </PERSON> <PERSON> Kessler </PERSON> of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, has labeled his client a `` small-time burglar'' with a penchant for stealing guns, but not a murderer. <PERSON> Kessler </PERSON> also has suggested that two <LOCATION> Phelps </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> sheriff's deputies might have entered the church looking for <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> and accidentally shot Long, who somewhat resembled the bald, bespectacled <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> <PERSON> Finnical </PERSON> calls the theory `` ridiculous.'' `` But ridiculous defenses have worked before,'' he said. `` It's up to us to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> did it. <PERSON> Kessler </PERSON> said prosecutors ca n't prove that <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> was ever in the church. `` They ask for the death penalty to bolster their tenuous evidence,'' he said. `` You ask for death to raise the stakes.'' <PERSON> Kessler </PERSON> said he did not know whether <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> would testify. The trial has featured some emotional testimony. <PERSON> Reinhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Bandowski </PERSON>, who found <PERSON> Long </PERSON>'s body near a water fountain in the church kitchen, broke down and cried on the witness stand when <PERSON> Finnical </PERSON> handed him a picture of the body. `` Oh, the blood ... the brains,'' <PERSON> Bandowski </PERSON> said. But the trial also has had its lighter moments. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Lambert </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> identified <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> as the man he saw in a stolen pickup truck parked outside his home in 1984. However, <PERSON> Kessler </PERSON> noted <PERSON> Lambert </PERSON> had told police that the man had brushy eyebrows and an Elvis Presley-like haircut. Pointing to <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, <PERSON> Kessler </PERSON> asked, `` This is <PERSON> Elvis </PERSON> you see here?''

 The murder trial of a man who led police on the biggest manhunt in <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> history has captivated residents of this Ozarks community, who lived in fear for two months in 1987 before his capture. From restaurants to beauty parlors, residents of this college town of 13,000 are buzzing about the trial of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, 35, became almost a folk hero, inspiring songs and T-shirts, by managing to elude an army of more than 250 law officers, bloodhounds and helicopters in the surrounding dense forests before his May 28, 1987, capture by <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents at an <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> motel. He is charged with murdering a volunteer at a church in <LOCATION> Doolittle </LOCATION>, four miles west of <LOCATION> Rolla </LOCATION>, during the two-month manhunt. The trial in <LOCATION> Phelps </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Circuit </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Court </LOCATION>, where all 100 seats in the courtroom were filled throughout last week, was to begin its second week Monday. `` It's the talk of my shop,'' beauty shop operator <PERSON> Lola </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> said last week. `` There's still a question mark in some people's minds whether he's a murderer or not They definitely feel he's a criminal, like I do. `` He had us scared there for a long time.'' The trial was delayed for months by various motions and by lack of funding in the public defender's office to pay for <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>'s defense `` Personally, I think he's guilty,'' said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Missouri-Rolla </ORGANIZATION> student lunching in a fast-food restaurant with friends. `` I'm getting tired of hearing about him, though, and I know others are, too.'' Assistant state attorney general <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Finnical </PERSON>, who is seeking the death penalty, contends that <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> shot <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Long </PERSON>, 56, at the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Apostolic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> on April 1, 1987, and then stole the victim's car At the time, police were hunting <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> for allegedly wounding a <LOCATION> Rolla </LOCATION> police officer two days earlier in a motel parking lot. Much of <PERSON> Finnical </PERSON>'s evidence is circumstantial, as there were no witnesses to <PERSON> Long </PERSON>'s slaying. However, <PERSON> Finnical </PERSON> said four ballistics experts will testify that a .357 - caliber Magnum revolver <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> carried when he was arrested was the same gun used to kill <PERSON> Finnical </PERSON> also produced several witnesses who had known or been robbed by <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, who had been on the loose since escaping from a southwest <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> prison in 1984, where he was serving a four-year sentence for burglary and possessing explosive weapons. The manhunt for him began, however, only after the police officer was shot. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Brad </PERSON> <PERSON> Kessler </PERSON> of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, has labeled his client a `` small-time burglar'' with a penchant for stealing guns, but not a murderer. <PERSON> Kessler </PERSON> also has suggested that two <LOCATION> Phelps </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> sheriff's deputies might have entered the church looking for <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> and accidentally shot Long, who somewhat resembled the bald, bespectacled <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> <PERSON> Finnical </PERSON> calls the theory `` ridiculous.'' `` But ridiculous defenses have worked before,'' he said. `` It's up to us to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> did it. <PERSON> Kessler </PERSON> said prosecutors ca n't prove that <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> was ever in the church. `` They ask for the death penalty to bolster their tenuous evidence,'' he said. `` You ask for death to raise the stakes.'' <PERSON> Kessler </PERSON> said he did not know whether <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> would testify. The trial has featured some emotional testimony. <PERSON> Reinhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Bandowski </PERSON>, who found <PERSON> Long </PERSON>'s body near a water fountain in the church kitchen, broke down and cried on the witness stand when <PERSON> Finnical </PERSON> handed him a picture of the body. `` Oh, the blood ... the brains,'' <PERSON> Bandowski </PERSON> said. But the trial also has had its lighter moments. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Lambert </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> identified <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> as the man he saw in a stolen pickup truck parked outside his home in 1984. However, <PERSON> Kessler </PERSON> noted <PERSON> Lambert </PERSON> had told police that the man had brushy eyebrows and an Elvis Presley-like haircut. Pointing to <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, <PERSON> Kessler </PERSON> asked, `` This is <PERSON> Elvis </PERSON> you see here?''

<HEAD>First Unsanctioned Opposition Candidate Elected in 40 Years</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BUDAPEST, Hungary (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A 35-year-old Lutheran minister has become the first fully independent opposition candidate elected to <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> in more than 40 years, state-run media said Sunday. <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON> <PERSON> Roszik </PERSON> won 69.2 percent of the ballots cast in a by-election Saturday in the town of <LOCATION> Goedoelloe </LOCATION>, about 15 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> MTI </ORGANIZATION> news agency said. <PERSON> Roszik </PERSON> was supported by a coalition of three of <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s strongest democratic opposition groups _ the <ORGANIZATION> Hungarian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forum </ORGANIZATION>, the League of Free Democrats and the youth group <ORGANIZATION> FIDESZ </ORGANIZATION> He defeated <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> candidate <PERSON> Laszlo </PERSON> <PERSON> Koeresfoei </PERSON>, a 58-year-old school administrator. Three other by-elections Saturday in the southern towns of <LOCATION> Szeged </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kecskemet </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Kiszkunfelegyhaza </PERSON> will be repeated Aug. 5 due to low turnout or the failure of candidates to get a required majority of the vote, <ORGANIZATION> MTI </ORGANIZATION> said. State radio said hot weather kept many Hungarians away from the polls. The low turnout indicated that neither the opposition nor the party mobilized Hungarians, who are preoccupied with falling living standards and inflation of at least 18 percent. It contrasted sharply with turnouts of more than 90 percent that had been claimed by the Communists for past elections. `` We are continuing where we left off in 1956,'' <PERSON> Roszik </PERSON> told an election rally last month, alluding to the short-lived revolt against Stalinism in 1956 that was crushed by Kremlin troops and tanks. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Polonyi </PERSON>, a retired museum director who earlier tried to run as a candidate in <LOCATION> Goedoelloe </LOCATION>, said of the race there: `` It seems anyone will do as long as they are not <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> members. Indeed, the stronger the attacks on the party, the greater the candidate's popularity.'' Saturday's by-elections were the first since 1947 to offer voters a genuine choice between <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> candidates and candidates put up by independent opposition groups. <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> held multicandidate elections for the 387-member Parliament in 1985. Twenty-five percent of those elected were not from the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, but all candidates in those elections had to be approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Patriotic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, a Communist-dominated umbrella organization for social or political groups. The Communists prevented dissidents such as <PERSON> Laszlo </PERSON> <PERSON> Rajk </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> from becoming candidates. In <LOCATION> Kecskemet </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Szeged </LOCATION>, the turnout was 44.1 percent and 45.2 percent respectively, <ORGANIZATION> MTI </ORGANIZATION> said, meaning new elections are needed because a 50 percent minimum turnout is required for the ballot to be valid. In <LOCATION> Kiszkunfelegyhaza </LOCATION>, 61.5 percent of the electorate turned out, but none of the three candidates _ a lawyer running with <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> support, a 34-year-old doctor backed by the former <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> youth league and an independent teacher _ got more than 50 percent of the vote, <ORGANIZATION> MTI </ORGANIZATION> said.

<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration is not willing to agree to raise taxes in the future in exchange for an immediate cut in the capital gains tax, <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> budget director <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> said Sunday. Even though President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has had discussions with House Speaker <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> and Rep. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ill </LOCATION>., chairman of the Ways and Means chairman, `` the president is firmly committed to his pledge not to raise taxes,'' <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> said on <ORGANIZATION> CBS-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Face the Nation. `` We're not talking about a deal'' <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> said. `` Others are talking about it, but the administration is not interested in that.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION> director said the Democratic leaders were blocking action on the capital gains tax cut that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wants. `` We believe that right now, we have the votes for a satisfactory capital gains proposal in the <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. Our only problem is ... -LRB- <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON> -RRB- wo n't actually bring it up for a vote,'' said <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> and other Democrats have contended that lowering the capital gains tax would hurt the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> and help the wealthy. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> argues it would stimulate economic growth and thus be a net money-raiser, not a loser, for the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>. Asked how long <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> intended to stick by his no-tax-increase pledge, <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> said, `` For the time being, let's assume forever _ but I do n't know exactly what that means.'' <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> called `` flawed'' a <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> analysis that a capital gains tax cut would be a money-loser after two years. <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> defended <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s newly announced space goals, including a return to the <LOCATION> moon </LOCATION> and eventual manned flight to <LOCATION> Mars </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has not put a pricetag on them. Asked where the money would come from, <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> said, `` It's going to come from the growth of our economy and wise investment of the federal budget.'' <PERSON> Darman </PERSON> said he could think of no better investment `` than investment in space. ... Let's choose the future.'' Astrophysicist <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> called <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s space plans `` extremely vague,'' and said the idea of sending `` human crews to <LOCATION> Mars </LOCATION> is ... straight out of 17th century science fiction.'' Both the <LOCATION> moon </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Mars </ORGANIZATION> are `` of great scientific interest,'' <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> said, but investigating them with unmanned spacecraft would be `` a far more fruitful way to go.'' `` The heavy hitters in the space program are the unmanned spacecraft, which operate all day, every day, for in many cases many years,'' said <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Truly </PERSON> defended <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s space goals, saying, `` It's one of the most rational sets of statements and goals that I've heard about the space program in a long, long time.'' Truly, a former astronaut, said `` a balanced program'' of manned and unmanned flights is needed. He bemoaned the battle between advocates of manned and unmanned space exploration, likening it to cowboys `` circling the wagons and then firing inward.'' <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> called himself one of Truly's fans, but insisted, `` If you want to give me any specific example of a scientific or practical mission, I will identify an unmanned method which is far cheaper and less expensive than the manned method.''

<DATELINE>TEMAGAMI, Ontario (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Mutterings can be heard in this sawmill town about the `` southerners'' and how the long-running battle over the region's forests could have been solved long ago without their interference. They're talking about city dwellers from urbanized southern <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION>, from such places as <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>, where environmentalists have taken on the fight to preserve <LOCATION> Temagami </LOCATION>'s old-growth red and white pine forests. The bulk of <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s population lives in southern areas not far from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> border. This is <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Near </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION>, a term used to differentiate it from the more vast and less populated barren stretches leading to the Arctic farther north. In addition to environmentalists and other `` southerners,'' the battle involves sawmill operators and forest product companies, eager to preserve precedents of access to lumber supplies, and an Indian tribe trying to assert a land claim. Canadians have long debated how to develop their resource-rich, rugged northern areas. Since the 19th century, <LOCATION> Temagami </LOCATION> has been a wilderness destination for Canadians and Americans looking for a remote escape. The diverging interests have resulted in a standoff over <LOCATION> Temagami </LOCATION>'s majestic forests, defying solution at a time when environmental issues have surged to the top of public concern nationally and internationally. <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Back </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Temagami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wilderness </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> said he hopes the chord of concern that the Brazilian rain forest's plight has struck in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> can be translated into intensified interest in troubles closer to home. As the environmentalists tell it, the logging industry supported by the provincial government is threatening the largest virgin pine forest left in <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION>. `` There is no comparable, accessible wilderness that we know about,'' Back said. Tourist brochures for the region note that it is not only within a day's drive of the eastern Canadian cities of <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION> but also of <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> and other <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> cities. Confrontations over forests also have taken place on <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>, most recently in the <ORGANIZATION> Carmanah </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Stein </PERSON> valleys of <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> But no dispute in the eastern part of the country has been as intractable or received as much attention as that in <LOCATION> Temagami </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Temagami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wilderness </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> has attracted 14,000 members. <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Moulder </PERSON>, district planner for the <ORGANIZATION> Ontario </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> that oversees land use for public lands, insisted that enough balance has been given to all interests and enough set aside for wilderness reserve. `` There's been harvesting -LRB- of trees -RRB- in this district for over 100 years,'' he said. `` There must be economic advantage, or they would have quit a long time ago.'' Environmentalists respond that the ante was raised by the mechanization of the logging industry since the 1950s that required ever larger sawmills to be fed by clearcutting of trees instead of selective harvesting. <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> is the world's largest exporter of forest products, sending 22 percent of all forest products traded on international markets. There are some 300 towns across the country where the industry serves as a mainstay. <LOCATION> Temagami </LOCATION> is a nondescript town of about 1,100 people on <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s North-South Highway 11, about a five-hour drive north of <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> On first glance it would seem an unlikely spot as the centerpiece for an environmental battle, but the area around it includes not only the forests but also a vast system of interlocking waterways ideal for canoeing. The fight specifically is over whether logging roads can be extended to allow clearcutting in previously inaccessible areas. A local Algonquin Indian group, the <PERSON> Teme-Augama </PERSON> <PERSON> Anishnabai </PERSON>, filed a claim in 1973 for 4,000 square miles of land. The claim was rejected a decade later but development in the interim was halted on public lands. Appeals until recently kept any logging road from being extended and also allowed time for the protests to gather support and symbolic value as a rallying cry. `` I do n't like how the land is being treated,'' <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>, an Indian who performed the tobacco ceremony at a recent blockade of a logging road, said at his home on <LOCATION> Bear </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. The Indians rejected a $ 35 million settlement offer from the government in 1986 but recently resumed talks. The <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION> government gave the go-ahead for work on two logging road extensions to proceed after the last appeal was rejected in provincial court this spring, although no logging has yet been allowed in the disputed area. Those who favor allowing more clearcutting say its effects can be compared to those of a forest fire, clearing out growth that no longer is productive and setting the stage for new trees to grow. They also say a steady supply of timber can insure that at least some sawmill jobs will remain in <LOCATION> Temagami </LOCATION>, if not the 150 that existed when the mill could operate at its peak. The local <ORGANIZATION> William </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Milne </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Sons mill has been in receivership since last December but a scaled down version is expected to resume operations soon. The wilderness advocates, however, argue that the old growth with trees dating back generations can not be replaced. They say the new forest that would spring up in its wake would not harbor the greater diversity of natural life now existing, especially in the fragile northern environment. `` There's never been an adequate evaluation of what's there,'' <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Huff </PERSON>, environmental director of the <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ontario </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalists </ORGANIZATION>, said. `` There's no place else that still has this combination of things still relatively intact.''

<HEAD>Gunmen Kill Catholic in Belfast</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELFAST, Northern Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Several masked gunmen barged into a home in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> on Sunday and killed a 37-year-old Roman Catholic, police said. The victim's 13-year-old son witnessed the attack but was unhurt, said a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ulster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Constabulary </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>'s police force. Police were uncertain how many gunmen participated in what was believed to be a sectarian killing. The spokesman said the gunmen fled in a car that had been stolen earlier in the day. The car was found abandoned in <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> on Sunday afternoon. It was the 30th death this year attributed to the conflict in the British-ruled province between unionists, mainly Protestants, who favor continued ties with <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and republicans, mainly Roman Catholic, who seek an end to British rule. Traffic on both sides of the border was diverted Sunday after the <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> claimed it had planted bombs along three main roads between the province and the <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>. Police said roads from <LOCATION> Letterkenny </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Buncrana </LOCATION> and the seaside resort of Muff, in the northern tip of <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, to <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Londonderry </LOCATION> were closed while troops searched for bombs. The crossing at <LOCATION> Buncrana </LOCATION> was reopened Sunday afternoon. A wooden box was found on the <LOCATION> Letterkenny </LOCATION> road early Sunday and was being examined, said a spokesman for the constabulary. Nothing suspicious was found on the other two routes, he said. For seven months, the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> has been disrupting rail service across the border. The <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement in March that one aim of the bombers was to draw British troops out of their hilltop bunkers and into more vulnerable positions in the countryside. In the central region of the province, police said security forces found a significant arms cache _ including a machine gun, assault rifle, two grenades from a Soviet-made RPG-7 grenade launcher, and 500 rounds of ammunition _ along the road between <LOCATION> Coalisland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Stewartstown </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tyrone </LOCATION>.

<DATELINE>KABUL, Afghanistan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government on Sunday said it foiled a plot to blow up a vital bridge that links <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and its main weapons supplier, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Nabi </PERSON> <PERSON> Amani </PERSON> said the plan was discovered after Afghan security forces arrested a Pakistani citizen, <PERSON> Mukhtar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gul </PERSON>, on July 6. Speaking to a small group of reporters, <PERSON> Gul </PERSON> said he and two compatriots were recruited to destroy Friendship Bridge in <LOCATION> Hayratan </LOCATION>, 350 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. The bridge, which spans the <LOCATION> Oxus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> separating <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, is the lifeline for the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> government in its battle with Moslem guerrillas. `` Our mission was to blow up the bridge and thus cut the supply line from <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>,'' said the 25-year-old <PERSON> Gul </PERSON>, who was introduced as a medical school dropout and an expert in underwater diving and subversion. <PERSON> Gul </PERSON> said he worked for a <LOCATION> Pakistani </LOCATION> government organization called CID. He did not elaborate. Gulf said he received training in subversion from an American in the Pakistani border city of <LOCATION> Peshawar </LOCATION>, where many of the guerrillas are based. The American was known to him only as <PERSON> Karim </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON>, he said. `` We had enough explosives and weapons to carry out our mission, but before that, I was arrested,'' said <PERSON> Gul </PERSON>, speaking in <LOCATION> Urdu </LOCATION>, the most common language in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. It was not immediately known what happened to the other two Pakistanis who had accompanied <PERSON> Gul </PERSON>. Guls' claims, which he said were not made under duress, could not be independently confirmed. The government has often accused <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, its southeastern neighbor, of being directly involved in the civil war, a charge <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION> denies. In a statement released after the news conference, the government said, `` The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> has been trying to use <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> as a springboard of aggression for carrying out its strategic objectives in the region. `` Now the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> authorities want to use Afghan territory also for such vicious ends as well,'' the statement said. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is the main weapons supplier to the guerrillas, known as mujahedeen or Islamic holy warriors. They have been fighting 11 years to oust the government. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> ended its nine-year military involvement in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> on Feb. 15 but continues to ship huge quantities or arms to Afghan government forces.

<HEAD>Heavily Armed Rioters Try to Provoke Troops in Georgia</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Security troops sent to quell ethnic rioting in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> are facing groups of heavily armed extremists who apparently want to provoke them into firing on civilians, official reports said Sunday. The Soviet news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported that the commanders of internal security troops in <LOCATION> Abkhazia </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> Black </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> enclave about 880 miles south of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, appealed to the local populace to resist `` extremists and bandits, not to allow further bloodshed.'' The commanders said they did not blame the populace for the slayings Friday of two security soldiers, whose deaths brought to 19 the number of poeple killed in a week of rioting by ethnic Georgians and Abkhazians. `` But at the same time, it's possible that there are forces that are not against creating clashes between the population and soldiers in order to provoke the troops into using their weapons, which they have n't done once in <LOCATION> Abkhazia </LOCATION>,'' the appeal said. In <LOCATION> Sukhumi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Abkhazia </LOCATION>'s capital, public transport resumed after days of paralysis from a strike, residents said Sunday in telephone interviews. But activists in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> have proposed a general strike Monday to protest what they see as a failure by police and troops to protect ethnic Georgians in <LOCATION> Abkhazia </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> officers in <LOCATION> Abkhazia </LOCATION> told Pravda they had `` never seen so many weapons in the hands of the population.'' The two police killed Friday were shot with hunting rifles as they were clearing roadblocks and confiscating weapons in western <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>. As a result of the continuing violence, two regional party secretaries were fired and two government leaders in <LOCATION> Abkhazia </LOCATION> lost their jobs Saturday. Abkhazians and Georgians blame each other for the ethnic unrest. Abkhazians, who are a minority in their own region, want greater economic independence and cultural rights, while Georgians want the fertile enclave, with its seaside resorts, retained as part of their <LOCATION> Caucasus </LOCATION> republic. The Georgian youth newspaper <PERSON> Molodyozh </PERSON> <PERSON> Gruzii </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Georgian </LOCATION> leaders want to develop a dialogue over problems besetting the region, but that Abkhazians want the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> to establish an outside body to take control of the region. At least 132 people have died in ethnic unrest during the past month in the southern Soviet republics of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kazakhstan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Uzbekistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tadzhikistan </LOCATION>.

 <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> tackles military spending this week as President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wages a last-ditch effort to save the B-2 bomber from money-conscious legislators opposed to the $ 530 million aircraft. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had groups of members to the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> on two occasions last week and plans to make individual pleas this week that the B-2, designed to penetrate Soviet airspace, is key to the nation's strategic nuclear deterrence `` The president is concerned by the opposition,'' <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> told reporters Friday. Lawmakers have expressed `` sticker shock'' at the plane's cost. The Pentagon has already invested about $ 23 billion in the program and wants an additional $ 70 billion to buy 132 copies of the plane. The one plane that exists has made one test flight _ lasting about two hours. Elsewhere on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, the focus this week remains on the unfolding scandal at the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>, the flag desecration issue and the savings and loan industry bailout. Debate on the military spending bill will be highlighted by two amendments to the defense bill that would either end the B-2 program or severely limit it. Rep. <PERSON> Les </PERSON> <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON>, D-Wis., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, is proposing paying for just two bombers in 1990 and 1991 rather than the eight sought by the Pentagon <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON> believes <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> needs more information on the radar-evading plane before deciding whether to kill it or spend more money. Two Republicans, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Rowland </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kasich </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, and Democrat <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Dellums </PERSON> of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> will introduce an amendment to complete work on the 13 bombers under way and mothball the production line. <PERSON> Rowland </PERSON> was one lawmaker summoned to the White House Friday, but <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s argument failed to sway him. `` I was not convinced by the president's remarks,'' <PERSON> Rowland </PERSON> said. `` There are a small number of Republicans and hopefully a large number of Democrats'' who believe testing should be completed before a commitment is made to build the 132 planes, <PERSON> Rowland </PERSON> said. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration has proposed spending $ 4.7 billion in fiscal 1990 for the B-2, but the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> cut that amount by $ 800 million. <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> said Sunday he was hopeful that the administration's arguments in support of the B-2 program would eventually prevail on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>. `` I think we're going to do fairly well. That is, I think we'll come out of it with what the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> recommended I hope in the House we'll be able to defeat the amendments to kill it outright,'' <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> said on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` This Week With <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Brinkley </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> noted that the congressional debate `` is partly over priorities. The people who want to cut the B-2 program are n't suggesting that tax dollars ought to go back to the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> or to the taxpayer They want to spend them on other systems.'' Support remains strong for the program on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, which trimmed just $ 300 million from the B-2 request. Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, D-Ga., chairman of the panel, said Sunday he agrees with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s contention that failure to proceed with the B-2 could vitally affect strategic arms control efforts `` I think we'd have to go back to the drawing board on arms control,'' <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> said on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Meet the Press'' program. `` We have premised our basic arms control position on bombers being a vital part of our overall triad,'' together with land-based and submarine-launched missiles. <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> described the B-2 as `` a very stabilizing weapon'' because unlike missiles, the bombers can be recalled after they have been put on airborne alert during a crisis. `` I'm particularly troubled by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION>,'' Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Warner </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, ranking Republican on the committee, said Friday. `` When this plane rolled out, some of the facts rolled out and now some people ca n't take the heat. And they're ducking under the table.'' Another Republican on the committee, Sen. <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallop </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, said if <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> chooses to limit spending instead of canceling the program or agreeing to the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> request, it would be `` the most irresponsible path to take.'' Debate over the stealth aircraft overshadowed such perennial fights as funds for the Strategic Defensive Initiative and the multiple-warhead, rail garrison MX missile vs. the single-warhead Midgetman. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> panel slashed $ 1.1 billion from <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposal of $ 4.9 billion for SDI, commonly known as Star Wars The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> cut $ 400 million from the president's request. Both panels accepted the administration's plan to fund two mobile missiles with $ 1.1 billion to move the existing 50 MX missiles from silos to railroad cars and $ 100 million for the Midgetman. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> also are expected to clash with the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> plan to cancel the V-22 Osprey, the tilt-rotor aircraft that takes off like a helicopter and can fly like a plane, and the F-14D Tomcat jet fighter. The V-22 is a top priority for lawmakers from <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> where the aircraft is manufactured. Members from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, particularly <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, have lobbied intensely for the F-14D, which is made by <ORGANIZATION> Grumman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. In other action this week: _ <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is pursuing an investigation of the scandal at the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> The House Government Operations housing subcommittee will hear from <PERSON> Lynda </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>, a former career <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> employee, about dealings with her friend, <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Dean </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> was executive assistant to former <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>, but numerous witnesses have described her as almost a surrogate Cabinet member who was heavily involved in funneling department money to well-placed Republicans. _ The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> plans to hold a drafting session to deal with responses to last month's <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s decision that burning the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> flag is a protected form of political expression The panel's subcommittee on constitutional rights completed hearings last week on the issue. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is divided over whether to seek a constitutional amendment banning flag desecration or to address the matter through a simple change in the law. _ After working behind closed doors most of last week, <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> negotiators working on a $ 166 billion bailout plan for the savings and loan industry will meet Tuesday with hopes of nailing down a final package The major remaining disagreement is how to raise the $ 50 billion needed immediately to cover the loss of federally insured deposits in some 500 S & amp; Ls at or near insolvency because of poor and often fraudulent lending.

<TEXT>
 The Kirov Ballet ended its 19-day season here with two programs of short ballets in which, surprisingly, principal dancers shone more brightly than they had in full-evening ballets danced earlier. Both mixed-bill programs will be presented during the July 25 - Aug. 6 Kennedy Center season and the Aug. 18 to 27 engagement in <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>. Only the full-length `` Sleeping Beauty'' and `` Le Corsaire'' are scheduled for <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, Aug. 9 to The more interesting program was the second one, because it contained two ballets choreographed by <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Balanchine </PERSON>. At 10, <PERSON> Balanchine </PERSON> began studying at the <ORGANIZATION> Imperial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ballet </ORGANIZATION> which, renamed, is the Kirov's school. He left <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION> in 1924. The Kirov did n't dance his ballets in his lifetime. On Saturday night, the company danced `` Scotch Symphony,'' as restaged for it by <PERSON> Suzanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrell </PERSON>, one of <PERSON> Balanchine </PERSON>'s last great ballerinas, and `` Theme and Variations,'' staged by <PERSON> Francia </PERSON> <PERSON> Russell </PERSON>, who was a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ballet </LOCATION> ballerina in the 1950s and'60s and afterward often set <PERSON> Balanchine </PERSON> ballets for European companies. The Kirov danced both ballets splendidly, with no apparent problems with the style. `` Theme and Variations,'' to music by <PERSON> Tchaikovsky </PERSON>, was intended by <PERSON> Balanchine </PERSON> to evoke <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> ballet's classical ballet heyday and `` Scotch Symphony,'' to evoke <PERSON> Mendelssohn </PERSON>, also is on the classical side of <PERSON> Balanchine </PERSON>'s choreographic <PERSON> Yelena </PERSON> <PERSON> Pankova </PERSON> and <PERSON> Irina </PERSON> <PERSON> Chistyakova </PERSON> were splendid in `` Scotch Symphony,'' which seemed _ maybe because of a painted backdrop _ to take on more of a story than when the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ballet </LOCATION> dances it. <PERSON> Farukh </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruzimatov </PERSON>, with exotic, dark eye makeup, was the dramatic partner of <PERSON> Larisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Lezhnina </PERSON> in `` Theme and Variations.'' In both mixed bills, viewers saw fewer balance problems than in earlier programs. The Kirov corps de ballet was matchless throughout the engagement. A group of classical pas de deux was inserted in the center of both mixed bills. <PERSON> Yulia </PERSON> <PERSON> Makhalina </PERSON> and <PERSON> Konstantin </PERSON> <PERSON> Zaklinsky </PERSON> and the corps de ballet were beautiful in the adagio from `` <LOCATION> Swan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION>.'' A charming trio from `` The Fairy Doll,'' a ballerina flirting with two clowns _ as at an ice show, the clowns have to be super-proficient _ followed. <PERSON> Altynai </PERSON> <PERSON> Asylmuratova </PERSON> and <PERSON> Eldar </PERSON> <PERSON> Aliyev </PERSON> made an excerpt from `` La Esmeralda'' far more exciting than the other couple we saw. <PERSON> Galina </PERSON> <PERSON> Mezentseva </PERSON> did an evocative but rather short `` The Dying Swan.'' Saturday night's audience was most enthusiastic. During final curtain calls, small bouquets were thrown from the boxes, landing at the feet of dancers who were clapping back at the audience. The first mixed bill ended with `` Paquita'' and began with `` Chopiniana,'' known in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> as `` Les Sylphides.'' <ORGANIZATION> Zhanna </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ayupova </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Irina </PERSON> <PERSON> Sitnikova </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kirill </PERSON> <PERSON> Melnikov </PERSON> were good but <PERSON> Natalya </PERSON> <PERSON> Pavlova </PERSON>'s landings were n't always in time with the music. Throughout the engagement, musical tempos were slower than many balletgoers ever had heard and sometimes, during a ballet, the tempo would slow still more, several times.

 <PERSON> Minnesotan </PERSON> <PERSON> Will </PERSON> <PERSON> Steger </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trans-Antarctica </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Expedition </ORGANIZATION> has reached its last stop in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> to await improved weather for the last leg of the flight to <LOCATION> Antarctica </LOCATION>. The Soviet cargo jet carrying the St. Paul-based dog sled expedition landed Saturday at <ORGANIZATION> Punta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arenas </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Chile </LOCATION>, on the Strait of <ORGANIZATION> Magellan </ORGANIZATION>. Blowing snow and poor visibility over King <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Island </PERSON>, off the northwest tip of the <LOCATION> Antarctic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penninsula </LOCATION>, kept <PERSON> Steger </PERSON>'s group from continuing Saturday. Storms sometimes prohibit travel to <LOCATION> Antarctica </LOCATION> for as long as two weeks. `` From now on, it's all forward. A break in the weather and we'll head straight south,'' <PERSON> Steger </PERSON> told a reporter from the <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paul </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pioneer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dispatch </ORGANIZATION> who was on the flight. The group's arrival in <ORGANIZATION> Punta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arenas </ORGANIZATION> ended a taxing weeklong flight from Minneapolis-St. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> aboard a Soviet Ilyushin-76, one aspect of the international partnership symbolized by the expedition The six team members are from six nations. Corporations and individuals have donated much of the $ 11 million it will cost to support them on their seven-month, 4,000-mile trek. Others have crossed <LOCATION> Antarctica </LOCATION> on snowmobiles and giant snow tractors, but if this group succeeds, it would be the first unmechanized crossing. The expedition was marred early, when two of <PERSON> Steger </PERSON>'s 42 sled dogs died during an unscheduled repair layover in steamy <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. As unprecedented as <PERSON> Steger </PERSON>'s attempt to cross the width of <LOCATION> Antarctica </LOCATION> will be the attempt by Soviet pilots to land their bulky Ilyushin-76 on the hostile continent. `` It is a pioneer flight to <LOCATION> Antarctica </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Chilingarov </PERSON>, a Soviet official who is escorting the expedition south. The Chilean-owned runway on King <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Island </PERSON> is a 4,290-foot strip cut across an isthmus. Overrunning it means a drop into the sea. The strip is hard-packed ground during the austral summer, but now it is hidden beneath 9 inches of ice. The Ilyushin-76, a wide-bellied plane similar to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military's C-141 and capable of carrying some 88,000 pounds, is more typically flown from concrete runways stretching to 8,250 feet. Chief pilot <PERSON> Stanislav </PERSON> <PERSON> Bliznyuk </PERSON>, top test pilot for the Ilyushin air manufacturing concern, has never landed one on ice.

<HEAD>Supreme Court Ruling Sends Woman Across State Line For Abortion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ST. LOUIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A woman carrying a severely deformed fetus was left with a choice of a 250-mile trip to get an abortion or going to another state because of the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s ruling on <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>'s abortion law, a newspaper reported Sunday. In its ruling July 3, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> said <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> can bar public hospitals from performing abortions. Within hours of that decision, <ORGANIZATION> Truman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, a public hospital in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, ordered its doctors to stop performing abortions. The <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Louis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post-Dispatch </ORGANIZATION> reported that a 24-year-old woman was referred to a specialist at <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> who confirmed through tests that the 19-week-old fetus she was carrying had deformities that made survival outside the womb impossible. A doctor familiar with the case told the newspaper the fetus' heart was outside the chest wall and that its abdominal organs were outside the abdominal wall. `` Before the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision, she would have had a therapeutic abortion at Truman,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwartz </PERSON>, an obstetrician and gynecologist who was a consultant on the case. <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> was believed to be the only site in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> where second-trimester abortions were widely available before the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling. After the ruling, the nearest clinic in <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> where the woman could have gotten a second-trimester abortion was across the state in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, a 250-mile drive. Instead, the woman was referred to <ORGANIZATION> Comprehensive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> for Women, a private gynecological clinic in nearby <LOCATION> Overland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> suburb about 20 miles away. The fetus was aborted in a two-day procedure July 11 and 12, and the woman's insurance company paid for it. <PERSON> Schwartz </PERSON> said he thought the woman's abortion was the first of what would `` turn out to be many cases of <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> women crossing to another state or traveling to <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> to obtain abortions.'' <PERSON> Adele </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughey </PERSON>, executive director of <ORGANIZATION> Comprehensive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>, said abortion was the woman's `` only real option.'' `` The condition of the fetus was totally incompatible with life,'' <PERSON> Hughey </PERSON> said. `` She could have carried the fetus through the entire term of pregnancy, knowing that the outcome would be a dead baby, or have an abortion and then try to get pregnant again. But by carrying the fetus to term, she might have jeopardized her own health and also delayed another pregnancy.''

 <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> congressman for 26 years before his political career fell apart in the Abscam scandal, has died. He would have been 71 on Wednesday. A spokeswoman for <PERSON> Johns </PERSON> <PERSON> Hopkins </PERSON> <PERSON> Hospital </PERSON> said <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> died shortly after 6 p.m. Saturday. He had undergone surgery for throat cancer earlier in the week. <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> had had a long history of heart disease, and underwent coronary bypass surgery in 1964. A lifelong smoker, he had given up cigarettes about a year ago, his longtime admistrative assistant, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Deitz </PERSON>, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trenton </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION> `` He had called me Monday and said the bad news was they had found a malignancy,'' <PERSON> Deitz </PERSON> told the newspaper. `` But the good news was they thought they could get it with a laser.'' <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> was born in <LOCATION> Trenton </LOCATION> on July 26, 1918. He served as a Naval officer in World War II and attended <ORGANIZATION> Wake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>. In 1949, he was elected to the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jersey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, and in 1954 to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> House of Representatives. He was re-elected 12 times, usually by overwhelming margins, and was chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> was a political ally of the <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> family when <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> was president, and headed his voter registration drive in 1960. A leader of Democratic liberals in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, he oversaw passage of major education and labor bills in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the Civil Rights Act of 1964.

He was defeated in that November's election by Republican <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> In December 1980, <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> was convicted by a federal jury, and served almost two years in the federal corrections center in <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION>, Ky. He maintained until the end that he was innocent. According to <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>'s Abscam indictment, he agreed to use his influence to help a group of <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> businessmen on `` an immigration matter.'' He and <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> lawyer <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Criden </PERSON> met with the undercover <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents and accepted $ 50,000. <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> then agreed to introduce the agents to other members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> willing to take bribes.

Sources in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> said Saturday that <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON>, who has not been charged with any crime, had access to some of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>' most sensitive non-nuclear secrets <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON>, former deputy chief of mission at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, is the highest-ranking <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomat ever identifed as the target of an intelligence investigation involving the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Mock, who studied with <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON> at the <ORGANIZATION> Bologna </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baltimore </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Johns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hopkins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in 1957 and 1958, said he first heard about suspicions regarding <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON> three weeks ago `` through Austrian channels,'' the tabloid said. `` I'm deeply shaken and really shattered,'' Mock was quoted as saying. He said he could not have unwittingly passed sensitive information to <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON>. `` I was very careful there,'' said <PERSON> Mock </PERSON>, who on Friday abruptly postponed a visit to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> this week `` for personal reasons.'' Kurier quoted Mock as speaking of `` a certain suspicion on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> side reaching back into the 1970s.'' He refused to provide details. But he said that if such suspicions existed, `` it's quite inexplicable how <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON> could stay in such high posts,'' according to the tabloid. Mock was in the west Austrian city of <LOCATION> Bregenz </LOCATION> on Sunday and could not be reached for comment. A man answering the telephone at the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> refused to comment on the report or to connect a reporter with a spokesman who would. <PERSON> Kurier </PERSON> said the minister described <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON> as `` an over-ambitious career diplomat'' who `` always suffered that he had to serve under political appointees and never got to be an ambassador himself.'' One of the ambassadors <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON> served was <PERSON> Helene </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Damm </PERSON>, an Austrian-born appointee of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, who caused a scandal in Viennese society by marrying <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Guertler </PERSON>, owner of the city's famed Hotel Sacher Ms. <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Damm </PERSON>, who was not reachable at her <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> residence Sunday, resigned in June 1985, citing speculation that her marriage constituted a conflict of interest with her diplomatic duties. <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON> came to <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> in 1980 as head of the embassy's economics section and was later appointed deputy chief of mission. He ran the <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> embassy after Ms. <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Damm </PERSON>'s resignation until <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lauder </PERSON> arrived in April 1986. <PERSON> Lauder </PERSON> said Saturday that he demanded that <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON> be recalled in the summer of 1987 because `` he went outside of channels ... he went around me'' in dealing with the Austrian Foreign Ministry. <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON> was too close to the Austrian government and `` extremely close to the foreign minister,'' <PERSON> Lauder </PERSON> said. Relations between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> were strained at the time of <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON>'s recall over the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> decision to place President <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> on a Watch List of persons barred from entering the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. That decision, announced in May 1987, resulted from <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>'s World War II past as a German soldier with the <ORGANIZATION> Nazis </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> Balkans </LOCATION> <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> had kept his <LOCATION> Balkans </LOCATION> service a secret until 1986, when Austrian and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> media and the World Jewish <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> disclosed it during a bitter presidential campaign in <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON> has consistently denied any wrongdoing in the <LOCATION> Balkans </LOCATION>. Mock, who until recently was leader of the conservative <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, has been one of <PERSON> Waldheim </PERSON>'s staunchest backers and recently launched another effort to try to get the president removed from the Watch List

 An appellate court panel probably withdrew its opinion ordering <LOCATION> Topeka </LOCATION> to do more to integrate its schools because the majority wants to respond to a dissenting judge's criticism, lawyers in the <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> vs. <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> desegregation case said Sunday The 10th <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>' withdrawal of the opinion without explanation last week had baffled both sides in the case. `` This is purely my speculation,'' said <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Topeka </LOCATION> lawyer who represents the plaintiffs in the 38-year-old case. `` But I think somewhere in the dissent someone is criticizing somebody else, and the majority wants an opportunity to respond to that criticism.'' <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> McAtee </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Topeka </LOCATION>, one of the attorneys who argued the case for the school board, said he `` would tend to agree with Mr. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>.'' The other possibility, <PERSON> McAtee </PERSON> said, `` is the dissenting judge has persuaded one of the other two judges to join him in his view but, quite frankly, I think that's unlikely.'' On Friday, the panel informed attorneys it was pulling back its June 2 ruling, which had reversed a district court judge's opinion that <LOCATION> Topeka </LOCATION> was substantially in compliance with the landmark 1954 <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision that ended racial segregation in the nation's schools. The court's notice gave no reason for the withdrawal. The most pessimistic interpretation for the plaintiffs, <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> agreed, is that the dissenter in the June ruling by the Denver-based <ORGANIZATION> 10th </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION>, Judge <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baldock </PERSON>, has persuaded one of the two other judges, <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON> <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> and <PERSON> Stephanie </PERSON> <PERSON> Seymour </PERSON>, to reverse their decision. <PERSON> McAtee </PERSON> said he considered that `` highly unlikely.'' <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Henson </PERSON> and other attorneys advising the <ORGANIZATION> Topeka </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> will meet with school district officials and board members Monday to outline their best interpretation of what the withdrawing of the June decision means. The case dates to 1951 when the father of <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, and other plaintiffs, sued alleging racial segregation in <LOCATION> Topeka </LOCATION>'s schools. <PERSON> Linda </PERSON>, then 6, could not attend a neighborhood school because it was for white children only. She attended an elementary school for black children nearly a mile away. Three years later, the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> struck down the concept of `` separate but equal'' schools for blacks and whites in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. In 1979, plaintiffs represented by <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> and other lawyers asked that the case be reopened to see if the <ORGANIZATION> Topeka </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> had lived up to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s mandate to integrate its schools. After seven years of discovery and a month-long trial in October 1986, a judge ruled in April 1987 that remaining racial imbalances in <LOCATION> Topeka </LOCATION>'s schools are the result of housing patterns and not the result of decisions by the school board. He also said evidence showed children attending schools with higher percentages of minorities did not receive an inferior education. The plaintiffs appealed that ruling to the 10th Circuit, which heard arguments in October 1987 and did not issue a ruling until last month. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> noted that recent <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> opinions frequently contain a `` dialogue'' between the majority and minority, and said judges <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> and <PERSON> Seymour </PERSON> may want to respond to what <PERSON> Baldock </PERSON> had to say. When the majority of the three-judge 10th Circuit panel issued its ruling, it did n't wait for <PERSON> Baldock </PERSON>'s dissent to be included.

<TEXT>
 The Cabinet on Sunday reaffirmed Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s plan for Palestinian elections, rejecting conditions that hard-liners tried to attach to it and defusing a crisis that threatened the coalition government. During the Cabinet session, about 1 million Israeli workers staged a two-hour strike to protest growing unemployment. About 2,000 workers demonstrated outside <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s office. In the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, police reported an Israeli taxi driver was stabbed three times by two <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> passengers who fled on foot. Spokesman <PERSON> Shalom </PERSON> <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Hemo </PERSON> said police were investigating if the crime was tied to the uprising. Ten Palestinians were wounded in clashes with the army in the occupied lands, Arab hospital officials said. The army confirmed two Palestinians were shot in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and said it was investigating the other reports. The PLO-backed underground leaders of the uprising issued a leaflet Sunday that called for an escalation of the revolt and again dismissed the <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> plan as an effort to `` gain more time and more opportunities to assassinate'' the revolt. The Cabinet vote was worked out as a compromise with Vice Premier <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, head of the left-leaning <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which had threatened to withdraw from the Likud-led coalition <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> over the proposed amendments. They included postponing the elections until the 19-month-old Palestinian uprising in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> ends. The Cabinet, which first approved the plan in May, voted 21-4 with one abstention to approve it without the conditions pushed by <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minister </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ariel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sharon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> and other party hard-liners. <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> joined two other <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> members in voting against the compromise. Another dissenter was Science Minister <PERSON> Ezer </PERSON> <PERSON> Weizman </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION>, who criticized the plan for not urging peace talks between <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. Emerging from the four-hour Cabinet session, <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> said the decision was something `` we can live with.'' `` If the peace initiative is the only guiding line of the government, we shall stay in the government,'' <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> told reporters. `` Today we clarified there is just one guideline.'' Labor's threat to topple <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s 8-month-old government came on July 12, a week after the hard-line demands were tacked onto the peace plan at a <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> meeting. The Israeli peace plan, first approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> on May 14, calls for the 1.7 million Palestinians in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> to elect representatives to negotiate with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> on limited self-rule in the territories. It calls for later negotiations on the final status of the occupied territories. The Likud on July 5 voted to delay any elections until the Palestinian uprising against <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> rule in the territories has ended. It also said the 140,000 Palestinians in east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> should be excluded from the vote. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> annexed east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> as part of its capital after its capture from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> in the 1967 Middle East War. The hard-line conditions prompted denunciations by the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> and criticism from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which has been trying to persuade the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> to accept the election plan. Sunday's statement made no reference to those conditions. It said: `` The peace initiative as approved by the government on May 14 and brought before <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> is hereby approved, stands as it is, and is valid and exists without any changes or amendments. `` The government continues to operate and will operate in accordance with the peace initiative which obligates the members of government as it was accepted.'' <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio reported <PERSON> Weizman </PERSON>, a former defense minister, told Sunday's closed-door session that he rejected the <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> plan because `` if we want peace, we have to talk to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>.'' <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> refuses to talk to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. The Cabinet also voted Sunday to add $ 75 million to the defense budget for battling the uprising. At least 518 Palestinians have been killed as a result of Israeli actions in the uprising, and another 83 have been slain by Palestinians who accused them of collaborating with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Thirty-seven Israelis have died in the revolt.

 The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration is short some personnel because it has bowed to intimidation from `` ultra-conservatives and single-interest groups'' on appointments, an <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> official complained Sunday. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Fulton </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>'s secretary of social services, said pressure from the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Right </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> to </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> cost him a sub-Cabinet post for which he was recruited by <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Fulton </PERSON> blamed a triangle of conservatives in outside groups, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the White House for blocking his selection and that of other mainstream Republicans with solid government credentials. <PERSON> Fulton </PERSON>, writing in the `` Outlook'' section of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>, laid some of the blame at President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s door, citing his `` lack of personal involvement in dealing with sub-cabinet appointments.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has left them to `` the mercies of White House Chief of Staff <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Fulton </PERSON>. `` <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>, himself far to the right of the Republican mainstream, has created a substantial network of right-wing ` transition' staff and other insiders whose life blood is politics rather than government,'' the <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> official charged. `` Having little appreciation of the difficult challenge of running government, they believe appointments should provide political rewards and always be made with an eye to the next election,'' said <PERSON> Fulton </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> never formally nominated <PERSON> Fulton </PERSON> as assistant secretary of <ORGANIZATION> HHS </ORGANIZATION> for the <ORGANIZATION> Family </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Support </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, the top federal welfare post. <PERSON> Fulton </PERSON> said he was unable to overcome opposition from the <ORGANIZATION> Right </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> To </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and several conservative senators, who blamed him for allowing children born with spina bifida to be denied care at the Children's Hospital of <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Fulton </PERSON> denied the charges, saying he was working in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> when the alleged denials of care took place in 1977-82, and that he took prompt action after becoming <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION>'s director of human services in 1983 `` to enhance protections for children with disabilities.'' He said <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>, the former governor of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, was reluctant to send nominations to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> for confirmation `` if there is apt to be vigorous opposition by a single Republican senator.'' Several conservative <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> lawmakers, including Sens. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, objected to <LOCATION> Fulton </LOCATION>, according to his account. On June 1, <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> HHS </ORGANIZATION> secretary, `` called to say he had concluded that we were ` at the end of the rope,''' and <PERSON> Fulton </PERSON> agreed to drop his candidacy. `` Jettisoning my nomination was a small price for the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> to pay in keeping peace with some of the extremists who are, for the moment, in the president's corner,'' <PERSON> Fulton </PERSON> said. He said <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> has also had his choice to run the <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> and Medicaid programs, <PERSON> Drew </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Altman </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> official, blocked, and Attorney General <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> had to abandon his choice for the No. 2 job in the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> attorney <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fiske </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> `` More than six months into the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration, dozens of key jobs still are not filled,'' said <PERSON> Fulton </PERSON>. `` The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration is being intimidated by ultra-conservatives and single-issue pressure groups,'' <PERSON> Fulton </PERSON> said. Their `` de facto vetoes ... are depriving the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration of people who can help it effectively run the federal government,'' he said. At the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, spokesman <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Hart </PERSON> declined comment on <PERSON> Fulton </PERSON>'s allegations except to say: `` We choose the nominees who are the right people for the job in our judgment.

 More than 100 Jewish students from <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> demonstrated outside a Roman Catholic convent at the edge of <LOCATION> Auschwitz </LOCATION> on Sunday and exchanged bitter words with several hundred Poles. It was the second weekend of protests at the Carmelite convent, but there was no repeat of the July 14 incident in which an American rabbi and six students were dragged away by convent construction workers after occupying the grounds for five hours. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Holocaust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Remembrance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> Sunday issued a protest to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> over the presence of the cloister. The convent was founded in 1984 in a former Nazi warehouse a few feet from the barbed wire fence and guard towers of the death camp, where an estimated 4 million people _ including 2.5 million Jews _ were put to death during World War II. The cloister's lawn, with a 23-foot wooden cross in the middle, is a former gravel pit where prisoners were gunned down by <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> executioners in 1940 and 1941. `` We have nothing against the Carmelites, but we are against them praying at this place,'' said <PERSON> Borem </PERSON> <PERSON> Laurent </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> resident and chairman of the Union of Jewish students of <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>. The group also included students from <LOCATION> Holland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. The 107 demonstrators, organized by the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Students </ORGANIZATION>, sat for 20 minutes about 15 feet outside the convent gate. Several hundred area residents, including couples with children, stood nearby, saying they came to `` defend'' the convent. `` It is as though really they do n't want to understand,'' <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Suchecky </PERSON> said of the Poles watching the protest. `` I do n't understand the obstinacy of marking every square inch with a cross. <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Arad </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Holocaust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Remembrance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> said in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>: `` The event in which Jews were attacked at the <LOCATION> Auschwitz </LOCATION> camp could have been avoided if the church authorities concerned with the matter fulfilled their promise in time.'' <PERSON> Arad </PERSON>, in a cable to <PERSON> Wladyslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Loranc </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s minister of religious affairs, appealed for a `` speedy transfer of the convent from the <LOCATION> Auschwitz </LOCATION> extermination camp in order to avoid such sorrowful cases in which either side is not interested.'' An agreement signed in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> in 1987 set a Feb. 22 deadline for moving the nuns to a planned interfaith center away from the death camp. The deadline passed, and construction on the new interfaith center had not started. On Friday, the state-run Polish news agency reported that land nearly 2,000 feet from the <LOCATION> Auschwitz </LOCATION> fence was purchased for the center this month and that construction will begin next year. `` The nuns do n't pray just for Poles here, they pray for all people who perished here,'' one member of the spectating crowd told the demonstrators. Another yelled out, `` They'll demand that the pope be removed too before long!'' When the students left, the nuns unlocked their gate to let out several people. As a nun approached the fence, a woman outside told her: `` Just call us again if someone else bothers you and we will come back to defend you.'' The nun would not answer reporters' questions.

 More than a year before the next election, national Democrats looked Sunday in the Granite State for a way to crack the Republican lock on the state's congressional delegation. `` We'd love to have a toehold up here,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Beryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ark </LOCATION>., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Campaign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION> is the only <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> state without a Democrat in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Both of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members and both its senators are Republicans. The last Democratic congressman, <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Amours </PERSON>, lost in the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> landslide of 1984. Now, the man who beat <PERSON> D'Amours </PERSON>, Republican Rep. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, is running for the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> to replace the retiring Sen. <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON>, R-N. The prospect of an open-seat race in 1990 has given Democrats hope where there was none. `` We'll target no more than 20 races. This is one on that list,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Synar </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Okla </LOCATION>., who is heading up the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> candidate recruiting effort <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bruno </PERSON>, the former state <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chairman who is looking at the race himself, assured the delegation from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> that `` this is a winnable seat.'' He made that assessment even though <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>, the former <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hampshire </ORGANIZATION> governor who is now President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s chief of staff, is expected to make a major effort on behalf of the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION>. Since <PERSON> Sununu </PERSON>'s departure, the state's economy has gone soft, and along with it the tax revenue base _ forcing the GOP-controlled state house to raise a variety of fees and levies this year. But he urged the national leaders to help local Democrats unite and avoid a bloody primary fight. `` If all of us go at it ... I do n't think the seat is winnable,'' he said. But a primary appears nearly certain, and while the national organization can provide up to $ 50,000 in direct and indirect help, it ca n't force local candidates to unite behind one. <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> and <PERSON> Synar </PERSON> met with four potential candidates in the congressional district, and two of them _ ideological opponents _ said they almost certainly were in the race. Attorney <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Keefe </PERSON>, a mainstream Democrat who ran against <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> in last year's election and was beaten by about 60 percent to 40 percent, plans to run again. He did 4 points better than Democratic presidential candidate <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> did in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, and says he can win without that drag on the top of the ticket. State Sen. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON>, a former state Golden Gloves champion and owner of two `` <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON>'s Lamb on the Run'' restaurants in <LOCATION> Manchester </LOCATION>, says he has the conservative credentials the state's voters demand, with a strong anti-tax record <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> has already formed an exploratory committee for the race and is raising money. `` I know I can win this,'' he told the congressmen Also considering entering the primary _ which is more than a year away _ is stockbroker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Demers </PERSON>. He ran for the seat in 1986 and received 44 percent of the vote against <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>. <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> and <PERSON> Synar </PERSON> also met with candidates in <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> and from <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION> on their first recruiting trip for the 1990 elections.

 Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> said Sunday the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> is considering establishing an ethnic German settlement in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to attract foreign investment. `` There are intensive talks going on in the Soviet party leadership, in the Politburo and in the government over whether settlements for minorities _ and the ethnic Germans are an important minority there _ should be set up,'' <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> said in a radio interview. The Bonn-based <ORGANIZATION> Die </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Welt </ORGANIZATION> newspaper reported in its weekend edition that Soviet officials are engaged in `` discrete talks with Western experts about the possibility of setting up free trade zones'' around <LOCATION> Leningrad </LOCATION>, in the <LOCATION> Baltic </LOCATION> area near <LOCATION> Kaliningrad </LOCATION> and in <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION>. Die <ORGANIZATION> Welt </ORGANIZATION> said <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> was especially interested in the proposal for an ethnic German settlement in the <LOCATION> Kaliningrad </LOCATION> region, a pocket of about 6,000 square miles of the Russian republic, wedged between <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and Soviet <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>. The port city of <LOCATION> Kaliningrad </LOCATION> was known as <PERSON> Koenigsberg </PERSON> before it came under Soviet control after World War II. It is a closed region, presumably because it contains strategic naval bases. Now mainly populated by ethnic Russians, <LOCATION> Kaliningrad </LOCATION> was once a center of commerce for <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s eastern territories before the war. Large groups of Germans live in the <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> republic of <LOCATION> Kazakhstan </LOCATION>, where they were forcibly relocated from the <LOCATION> Volga </LOCATION> region and <LOCATION> Bessarabia </LOCATION> by the late <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> before and during the war. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>, in the interview with <ORGANIZATION> Deutschlandfunk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION>, stopped short of saying the talks centered on the creation of an `` autonomous region'' for ethnic Germans in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. `` But they are going in this direction,'' he said. Die <ORGANIZATION> Welt </ORGANIZATION> said such a settlement in the <LOCATION> Kaliningrad </LOCATION> region could lure `` West German and American companies to create joint ventures and give a new home to displaced German minorities.'' <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> said about 2 million ethnic Germans live in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. `` The majority of them want to remain in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> said. `` But they also want to retain their identity as ethnic Germans ... and hope that an ethnic German territory or republic can again be set up there.'' <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> said Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> expressed a `` positive interest and favorable evaluation of such a development'' during his visit to <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> in June. Soviet <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> hinted during the visit that one proposal called for establishing an ethnic German region in <LOCATION> Kaliningrad </LOCATION> but said it was `` one of several ideas.'' The establishment of such a region would serve the dual purpose of boosting West German-Soviet business ties and stemming the flow of ethnic Germans to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. As the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> has relaxed restrictions on the emigration of those of German ancestry, tens of thousands of ethnic Germans have left their Soviet homes to resettle in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s constitution recognizes a right by all people of German nationality to return to their homeland, and massive outlays for housing, language instruction and work training have been required to help the Soviet Germans resettle. About 50,000 Soviet Germans arrived in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> in 1988 alone.

 An <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> jet with 248 people aboard ran into unexpected turbulence that threw passengers against the cabin ceiling, sending 45 people to the hospital, officials said Sunday. `` I bounced off the ceiling twice. It scared the heck out of me,'' passenger <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Watson </PERSON>, 39, of <LOCATION> Jensen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, said after the accident Saturday night on the A-300 Airbus. Most of those injured suffered neck and shoulder sprains, said airline spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hotard </PERSON>. There were no broken bones. The ride became rough with 40 minutes left in the three-hour flight from <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, as the aircraft descended for a landing at <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. The turbulence at 35,000 feet `` threw the aircraft up and then down,'' <PERSON> Hotard </PERSON> said in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> American </LOCATION>'s headquarters in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Seat-belt lights were n't on, <PERSON> Watson </PERSON> said in an interview at the airport. <PERSON> Watson </PERSON> said the pilot told passengers the storm was unexpected. The pilot's radar was clear and showed no thunderstorms, <PERSON> Hotard </PERSON> said. Flight 1077, carrying 239 passengers and a crew of nine, landed at about 11 p.m. Saturday. Medical personnel and equipment met the plane, and several passengers were removed in wheelchairs and stretchers. Four flight attendants and 41 passengers were taken to hospitals, <PERSON> Hotard </PERSON> said. Several were kept overnight for treatment and released in the morning. The plane sustained no exterior damage, but 12 seats were damaged and holes were punched in the cabin's overhead compartment, the spokesman said. Passenger <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallardo </PERSON>, 40, said his thoughts flashed to the deadly crash Wednesday of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> Flight 232 in <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>. People `` were praying,'' he said. `` There were many hysterical people.''

 The lanky strike leader smiled in the gloom of the west Siberian hotel room, puffed deeply on a strong Russian cigarette, smiled and said: `` I never thought I would have this conversation.'' `` They used to tell us that foreign corresondents wanted to come here to mark our factories on their maps so they could drop nuclear bombs on them,'' said <PERSON> Vyacheslav </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Akulov </PERSON>. `` Now you come here to cover our strike.'' <PERSON> Akulov </PERSON>, 38, one of 26 members of the <ORGANIZATION> Strike </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> Kuznetsk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Basin </LOCATION> of western <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION>, is amazed at the changes taking place in his country. Like other strike leaders interviewed Thursday and Friday in <LOCATION> Prokopyevsk </LOCATION>, he expressed more hope than anger in explaining the miners' demands, and he radiated confidence at government concessions that sent the miners back to work on Friday. Hundreds of thousands of miners elsewhere in the country remain on strike in the largest industrial job action in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in 60 years. The miners, like nearly everyone else in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, have been watching nationally televised sessions of the new <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION>, which met in May and June, and the reconstituted Supreme Soviet, the standing parliament. The lawmakers have inspired the nation with step after unprecedented step, rejecting Cabinet nominees and criticizing the armed Forces, the <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> and other former sacred cows of Soviet communism. On July 11, coal miners in <LOCATION> Mezhdurechensk </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Prokopyevsk </LOCATION> and 1,200 miles east of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, decided it was their turn to speak out and began a strike that at its height involved half the nation's 1 million coal miners and stretched from the <LOCATION> Arctic </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Ukraine </LOCATION>. The miners want better benefits and higher wages so they can buy Western-style goods; they also want the right to strike and more representative trade unions. Among the lawmakers that <PERSON> Akulov </PERSON> admires most is <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON>, the Nobel Peace Prize winner who was sent into external exile in 1980 for his dissident views but who has since been rehabilitated. `` Before, we were told that <PERSON> Sakharov </PERSON> was anti-Soviet. And we believed them. Now we find out that he was the conscience of the nation, one of the few people who had the courage to stand up and speak the truth when it was dangerous. That's what we all need to do now,'' said <PERSON> Akulov </PERSON>. Akulov, from the city of Anzhero-Sudzhensk at the northern end of the <LOCATION> Kuznetz </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Basin </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Kuzbass </LOCATION>, is an engineer who installs steel supports in the deep mines of the region. He has the sinewy arms and gaunt face of many Siberian miners. <PERSON> Akulov </PERSON>, who has rarely left the <LOCATION> Kuznetz </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Basin </LOCATION> and never before met a Westerner, says he has no trouble envisioning the demise of the one-party Communist system and the development of several parties contending for popular support. `` That's like you have in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, is n't it? Several parties present their ideas in the legislature, debate them and find a compromise. That how it should be. That's what we need,'' he said, bringing his fists together. <PERSON> Akulov </PERSON> grinned, showing several gold teeth. `` If I had said these things even five years ago, I would have been asking for a trip even deeper into <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` But it's good that we're tearing down the Iron Curtain and now can learn what goes on abroad.'' Besides their demands for higher living standards and political reforms, the miners want a greater voice in managing their industry _ a demand they won in the agreement that sent them back to work on Friday. Coal mines in the <LOCATION> Kuzbass </LOCATION> will remain under the <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mining </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION>, but starting Jan. 1 they may form regional associations with the right to market coal they produce above and beyond the government quota. The miners hope to eliminate the state quota `` step by step,'' said <PERSON> Akulov </PERSON>, and to achieve what the Soviets call regional economic autonomy. `` It is hard to say exactly where this idea came from, but it was not born all at once,'' he said. `` It had been building for a long time.'' Government leaders say the idea needs to be worked out by the legislature, but the fact they have agreed to it at all marks a major step in the decentralization of economic decision-making power, which has been concentrated in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> since the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution.

<HEAD>Angolan Government Accepts Mobutu's Cease-fire Proposals</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LUANDA, Angola (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government accepted proposals by President <PERSON> Mobutu </PERSON> <PERSON> Sese </PERSON> <PERSON> Seko </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION> for monitoring a cease-fire in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>'s 14-year-old civil war, according to an official statement Sunday. But U.S.-backed guerrillas Saturday requested a week's break in peace talks to consult with the leaders of the rebel group, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> for the Total Independence of <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mobutu </PERSON> is mediating the negotiations in the Zairean capital of <LOCATION> Kinshasa </LOCATION>. The Angolan government did not release details of his proposals but the Zairean leader said last week they included installing a radio link between <LOCATION> Luanda </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kinshasa </LOCATION> and the guerrillas' southeast Angolan bush headquarters of <LOCATION> Jamba </LOCATION>. Angolan armed forces chief <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> dos </PERSON> <PERSON> Santos </PERSON> <PERSON> Franca </PERSON>, who headed the government delegation, was quoted by <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>'s government media as saying rebel negotiators agreed to some of <PERSON> Mobutu </PERSON>'s proposals but wanted to discuss others. The talks, which began Wednesday, are scheduled to resume on July 31. They marked the second time the two sides have met since rebel leader <PERSON> Jonas </PERSON> <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> and Angolan President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> dos </PERSON> <PERSON> Santos </PERSON> sealed a truce with an historic handshake at a June 22 summit of 18 African leaders in <PERSON> Mobutu </PERSON>'s ancestral village of <LOCATION> Gbadolite </LOCATION>. Under the <LOCATION> Gbadolite </LOCATION> agreement, a cease-fire began June 24 and both sides agreed to create a joint commission, mediated by <PERSON> Mobutu </PERSON>, to work toward peace. <PERSON> Dos </PERSON> <PERSON> Santos </PERSON> withdrew his delegation from the first round of talks on July 1, saying the rebels had violated the cease-fire. The Angolan state news agency continued to report guerrilla attacks as negotiations ended Saturday. The rebels have made counter charges of government truce violations. However, sources close to the government said in <LOCATION> Luanda </LOCATION> Sunday the talks were developing `` normally.'' `` It's necessary first of all to consolidate the cease-fire and later we can go on to discuss political questions. ... You ca n't have negotiations on peace if the war continues,'' <PERSON> dos </PERSON> <PERSON> Santos </PERSON> <PERSON> Franca </PERSON> was reported as saying Since the <LOCATION> Gbadolite </LOCATION> meeting, there has been confusion over just what the Angolan government and rebels agreed to in the accord. The government claims <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> pledged to leave the country temporarily while members of his movement are integrated into society. <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> has denied he agreed to exile, however. Rebel spokesmen have rejected integration, calling instead for the formation of a transitional government comprised of members of both sides to prepare for general elections. The guerrillas have fought to share control since the Marxist government took power shortly after <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>'s independence from <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> in 1975. Formerly the rebels' biggest backer, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> pledged to halt aid to <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> in a U.S.-sponsored agreement signed with <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> in December. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> continues to send the rebels about $ 15 million a year. Under the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> accord, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> has begun withdrawing its 50,000 troops helping the Angolan government.

 Fax machines can be fun, particularly when a newspaper receives a governor's private memo instead of the press release it's supposed to get. Gov. <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON>'s press secretary, <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Abbott </PERSON>, last week inadvertently sent The <ORGANIZATION> Birmingham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> a memo addressed to <PERSON> Hunt </PERSON> instead of an intended news release via a fax machine. `` I've noticed that you've been saying that last week was the best single week in the history of the state for economic development and that <ORGANIZATION> Nichii </ORGANIZATION> is the largest grocery store chain in the world,'' the memo said. `` Last week was one of the best weeks, but we ca n't claim the best because the <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION> announcement in 1981 was $ 1.5 billion all by itself. You probably should just stick to saying what you said last week at the news conference, that it was one of the best weeks in history. `` As you said in your original statement that day on the steps of the Mansion, <ORGANIZATION> Nichii </ORGANIZATION> is one of the largest grocery store chains in the world, not the largest.'' <PERSON> Abbott </PERSON>, who the newspaper said was obviously embarrassed, called The News and explained the error in transmission.

 A county planner who initially feared thieves had stolen a beach now believes the sand was washed away by the <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> _ during lunch. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobsen </PERSON> said Thursday that the gleaming white beach west of The <PERSON> Dalles </PERSON> was missing. The <LOCATION> Wasco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> planner said `` scoop marks'' on the riverbank led her to believe someone with a barge and bulldozer had taken the beach. But a biologist said Friday that he watched the beach disappear during lunch on Monday. <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Schacher </PERSON> and two other biologist aides for the <ORGANIZATION> Oregon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fish </ORGANIZATION> and Wildlife were tagging sturgeon on the <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> when they decided to take a lunch break at Squally Point beach.

The cracks started coming farther apart.'' As the trio watched, a powerful whirlpool pulled more and more of the sand into the river. A surge of water as the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION> raised and lowered water levels in the pool behind Bonneville Dam probably undercut the bank and caused the sand to slough away, <PERSON> Jacobsen </PERSON> said. `` It seems less of a mystery now,'' she said after hearing <PERSON> Schacher </PERSON>'s tale.

 They're at it again in <LOCATION> Bruno </LOCATION> a year after 328 volunteers attracted international attention by lifting a 9-ton, two-story barn by hand and carrying it more than 143 feet to a new location. <PERSON> Herman </PERSON> <PERSON> Ostry </PERSON>, the original lift planner, and his friends want to do it again next Sunday, although this lift will be less strenuous.

More than 3,500 people overflowed the village to watch 328 volunteers move the massive 60-year-old barn.

 The new head of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> put his stamp of leadership on the governing party with the release Sunday of an essay on discipline. <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON> <PERSON> Zemin </PERSON> takes a hard line on fighting corruption and enforcing obedience to central leadership _ both issues that senior party leaders have accused his predecessor, <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON>, of neglecting. <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> was ousted as party leader last month after troops crushed the pro-democracy movement led by university students. <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON>'s essay was printed in full in the magazine Party Building and summarized in leading newspapers Sunday. `` We must sternly observe unified party discipline, namely: The individual obeys the group, the minority obeys the majority, the lower levels obey the upper levels, the whole party obeys the center,'' <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON> says. `` We can not allow the unchecked spread of individualism, separatism and money worship.'' The People's Daily said the essay was written in May. The crackdown on dissent began June 3-4 when troops fired on unarmed demonstrators and drove them from <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s Tiananmen Square. The government says about 200 people were killed; Chinese witnesses and Western intelligence reports say as many as 3,000 died. It was the second essay by <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON> to be widely disseminated in recent weeks. In the first <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON> wrote about the `` dangers'' of allowing businessmen to get too rich from private enterprise. In the essay published Sunday <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON> said, `` Today many peoples' thinking is lively, and they dare to express various views, which of course is a good thing `` But we party members must ponder deeply new ideological trends and public opinion and keep clear heads.'' He made no reference to `` bourgeois liberalism,'' or Western-style liberal thinking, which party leaders blame for the pro-democracy demonstrations. There were these other developments: _ The <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> reported that explosives were set off in mid-July in a post office on <LOCATION> Hainan </LOCATION> island but said it was not known if the blast was linked to the political turmoil. The <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION> attributed its report to a <LOCATION> Hainan </LOCATION> radio broadcast that said investigators reported nitroglycerin exploded in the post office. It gave no further details. Several explosions have been reported on trains since the student-led protests were crushed. The worst occurred June 26 when dynamite exploded on a Shanghai-bound train killing 24 people. _ An official report in the <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> said <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> plans to apply for $ 500 million in new loans from the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> this year or early next year. The report did not mention that the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> has postponed considering an earlier application by <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> for loans totaling $ 780.2 million. According to the newspaper report <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> wants the new loans for agricultural projects and road construction in western <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. _ A Chinese dissident living in exile in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> said <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> is neither a republic nor a government of the people but an empire with top leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON> the emperor. <PERSON> Yan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jiaqi </PERSON>, in an article published Sunday in the Chinese language newspaper <PERSON> Ming </PERSON> <PERSON> Pao </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, said, `` A republic does not allow anybody to be the king in real or in name. It does not allow lifelong centralization of supreme power. But <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON> is actually <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s latest emperor.'' <PERSON> Yan </PERSON>, a professor, led a union of intellectuals during the student uprising this spring. He was on the government's wanted list of `` counterrevolutionary rebels'' and he and his wife fled to <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> in late June. In the article <PERSON> Yan </PERSON> said, `` The June 4 massacre completely exposed <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>'s real self which had been carefully hidden for so many years. Facing the whole country's anger, he did not give up his power. The public demanded him to retire and step down; he used tanks, armored personnel carriers and machine guns to suppress these armless people.''

 An <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> rancher accused of links to drug trafficking and the Iran-Contra scandal is missing and may have been kidnapped, one of his lawyers said Sunday. <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Jimenez </PERSON>, a spokesman at the <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, said Costa Rican authorities had lost sight of rancher <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hull </PERSON> since Thursday. He refused to say whether <PERSON> Hull </PERSON> had left the country. `` I suspect that Mr. <PERSON> Hull </PERSON> has been kidnapped,'' said <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Sobrado </PERSON>, <PERSON> Hull </PERSON>'s lawyer. `` Something similar occurred in 1982, when <PERSON> Hector </PERSON> <PERSON> Frances </PERSON> was kidnapped by a leftist commando with links to -LRB- <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s -RRB- Sandinista regime,'' <PERSON> Sobrado </PERSON> said. He referred to an Argentine citizen who allegedly worked for the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Hull </PERSON>, 69, from <LOCATION> Evansville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, has lived in <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> for the past 20 years, and became a naturalized citizen seven years ago. He lives on a ranch in the northern part of the country, near the Nicaraguan border. <PERSON> Hull </PERSON> has been indicted in <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> on charges of drug trafficking and violating state security, but no trial date has been set. He pleaded innocent and was released on $ 37,500 bail after his doctors said he had suffered a heart attack. A Costa Rican congressional commission on Thursday recommended that <PERSON> Hull </PERSON> be stripped of his citizenship and expelled from the country.

 Voters cast ballots Sunday in the first primary elections ever held by the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> as part of the government's program of democratic reforms. The opposition <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> also held primaries to select candidates for national and local elections in December. Many members of the <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> had objected to the previous system of party leaders selecting candidates for national elections. There were long lines of voters at many of the nation's 1,534 polling stations, which opened at 8 a.m. and closed at 6 p.m. Officials estimated that 50 percent of the eligible voters participated. Results were expected to be announced Monday. About 1.98 million Nationalists and the 20,000 members of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> were eligible to vote in the primaries. <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s population is estimated at 20 million. The Democratic Progressive party was formed three years ago in defiance of martial law and was technically illegal until earlier this year when it registered with the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>. During the primary campaign critics claimed <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leaders have a list of preferred candidates who will be nominated regardless of the results of the primary balloting. There were 662 Nationalist members registered to run in the primaries for national legislative seats, provincial assembly posts and county and city offices. The Democratic Progressives chose among 52 candidates for 48 offices. They did not run in many districts for the 101 seats in the Legislative Yuan that are at stake in the Dec. 2 election. The Yuan is <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s highest lawmaking body. In the Nationalist primary candidates who win 50 percent or more of the vote in individual consituencies will not be guaranteed a place on the December ballot. Instead they will be listed as `` important references'' in the preliminary stage of the campaign, thus allowing party elders to maintain some control over the choice of candidates. Candidates who win a majority of the votes in the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> primaries will be assured of a spot on the party's ticket

<TEXT>
 The National Organization for Women ended its national convention here Sunday by agreeing to explore the formation of a new political party for women. The convention adopted a resolution calling for a commission to study forming a party `` dedicated to equality for women'' because of `` the failure of both major political parties to address women's needs. NOW President <PERSON> Molly </PERSON> <PERSON> Yard </PERSON> said in an interview that the proposal reflected the NOW membership's `` total disgust'' with the Democratic and Republican parties. `` We are 52 percent of the country and we have almost no representation,'' Ms. <PERSON> Yard </PERSON> said. `` As a whole, the majority is voting against women all the time. We're sick of it.'' The convention also passed a resolution called a `` Bill of Rights for the 21st Century.'' The resolution called for an expansion of the Bill of Rights to include: _ Freedom from discrimination on the basis of race, sex, sexual orientation or age _ Freedom from government interference in abortion or birth control, and the right of women to receive public funds for abortions, birth control and pregnancy services _ The right to a safe environment, a decent standard of living and freedom from violence `` We're fighting for women's individual rights,'' Ms. <PERSON> Yard </PERSON> said. `` I feel we are in a battle.'' The convention's delegates also passed a resolution calling for testing and distribution of the French RU-486 abortion pill in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The pill has been `` heavily tested in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>,'' and is `` a very good method of abortion,'' Ms. <PERSON> Yard </PERSON> said. `` I find if outrageous that it is n't here,'' she said. The delegates also passed a resolution detailing plans for NOW's `` Freedom Campaign for Women's Lives,'' a national effort by the organization to lobby for abortion rights on both the federal and state levels The campaign's plans include: _ A national march scheduled for Nov. 12 in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to protest the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s July 3 ruling in Webster vs <ORGANIZATION> Reproductive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which gives states the power to restrict abortions. _ Targeting states for ballot initiatives on abortion rights, and to introduce legislation to stop anti-abortion legislation in states _ To pass federal legislation that will ensure abortion rights Ms. <PERSON> Yard </PERSON> said that work on both the national and state levels on the abortion issue is imperative for NOW. `` We have to do both,'' she said. `` We do n't have any choice.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s ruling in the <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> case has mobilized young people to become involved in fighting for abortion rights, Ms. <PERSON> Yard </PERSON> said. `` It's very clear that we're in a battle, but it's also clear we have a lot of recruits,'' she said.

<TEXT>
 The total hydraulic failure that sent <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> Flight 232 out of control also caused the worst single-plane disaster in history in 1985, but pilots still do n't train for it, says a former DC-10 flight instructor. `` If it had only been partial hydraulic failure, I think he could have handled it,'' <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Eanes </PERSON> said of Capt. <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Haynes </PERSON>, pilot of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> DC-10 that crashed last week at <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>. The disaster killed 110 of the 296 people aboard. `` We train for that. But we do n't train for what he faced because the airplane is n't controllable,'' Eanes, a resident of Grand Prairie, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, said in a telephone interview Saturday. `` It's incredible,'' said retired DC-10 flight engineer <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Richardson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, who was also interviewed by telephone. `` I just ca n't believe it was successful.'' <PERSON> Eanes </PERSON> said Flight 232's problems were similar to the catastrophic loss of hydraulic fluid that crippled a <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 in 1985. In that case, hydraulic lines ruptured after the aft pressure bulkhead blew out. The pilot of the <ORGANIZATION> JAL </ORGANIZATION> airplane maneuvered for 30 minutes by varying thrust from different engines before the aircraft crashed into a mountain, causing the worst single-plane air disaster ever as 520 people died. Four survived. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Gamble </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commercial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airplane </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, pointed out a difference between the two cases. `` The <ORGANIZATION> JAL </ORGANIZATION> pilot was trying to keep altitude because he was over mountainous terrain. He was trying to turn and get back to an airport but he was over mountainous terrain. It was quite a long distance to the airport. In the DC-10 case, he was n't that far from an alternate airport.'' `` He -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> JAL </ORGANIZATION> pilot -RRB- did succeed in turning. He was headed back toward <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> when he crashed into the mountain. The problem was he could n't keep altitude.'' United Flight 232's crew, aided by an off-duty pilot who rushed to the cockpit to help, used differential engine thrust from their remaining two wing-mounted engines to control the wide-bodied jet after its tail-mounted engine apparently blew apart and destroyed the plane's hydraulic system. With differential engine thrust, a plane will slowly turn in the direction of the slower engine. Without hydraulic power, the crew could not manipulate control surfaces on the wings and tail to alter direction, raise or lower the nose, or extend wing slats and flaps that increase lift during takeoffs and landings. Flight 232's flight engineer told <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> investigators that the loss of the plane's hydraulic fluid was `` immediate,'' giving pilots no time adjust those control surfaces. But the crew managed to guide the airplane to a crash landing at <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gateway </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, where emergency equipment and medics were waiting. The crash killed 110 but 186 others survived, including the flight crew. <PERSON> Eanes </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> crew faced an additional problem. The damaged tail section assymmetrical drag _ that is, given equal power to both remaining engines, the plane still turned to the right. To counter that, he said, pilots had to overcompensate with the right wing engine. That made the landing attempt even more difficult, he said. `` There's a certain point where you have to come off the power to get on the ground. He obviously had to carry more power in one engine than the other to overcome asymmetrical drag,'' he said. Eanes, who continues to fly for a commercial airline company that he asked not be identified, noted that without control over the wing slats and flaps, Flight 232's crew was forced to approach the landing at least 80 mph faster than normal so the wings would n't lose lift. `` How they ever got down to a reasonable height to even attempt a landing is beyond my comprehension,'' said <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>.

 Women made their voting power felt Sunday by electing a record number of women to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s upper house of parliament in a campaign marked by a sex scandal and a politician's derogatory remarks about females Preliminary returns showed 19 women elected to the House of Councilors, the less powerful chamber of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s bicameral legislature, far surpassing the previous record of 10 women, according to <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. Ten of those elected were supported by the <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, led by Chairwoman <PERSON> Takako </PERSON> <PERSON> Doi </PERSON>. The party's dramatic gains helped strip the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> of its upper house majority for the first time in 34 years. The Socialists fielded 12 women candidates in the election, twice as many as in 1986. Half of the 252-member upper house is elected every three years and elections to the more powerful lower house are not due until July, 1990. A record 146 women ran in the election, up from 82 in the last upper house election. Before the election, only 10 percent of upper house members were women; the lower house has only seven women to 505 men. The large number of women candidates reflected what is being called the `` Madonna phenomenon,'' or opposition parties fielding female candidates to capitalize on women's displeasure with the ruling party. Women's potential clout is enormous. Among eligible voters, women outnumber men by 2.7 million, and they are more likely to cast ballots. The female protest vote stemmed from reports that for as long as 10 years, Prime Minister <PERSON> Sousuke </PERSON> <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> paid women, including professional geisha entertainers, to be his mistresses. Uno has not denied the allegations, but maintains that he did nothing immoral. Equally damaging were comments by Agriculture Minister <PERSON> Hisao </PERSON> <PERSON> Horinouchi </PERSON> earlier this month that `` women are useless in politics.'' He said their primary task in life is `` to keep the household.'' <PERSON> Horinouchi </PERSON> further attacked the Socialist's Ms. <PERSON> Doi </PERSON>, saying she was unfit to be prime minister because she had never married or had children. He apologized for his remarks, but women seized on them to assail the ruling party and promote opposition-backed female candidates. `` The votes today proved that the people believe women have the power to serve in parliament,'' newly elected parliamentarian <PERSON> Harumi </PERSON> <PERSON> Kan </PERSON> said in a television interview. Ms. <PERSON> Kan </PERSON> ran with the new labor-based <ORGANIZATION> Confederation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> in rural <LOCATION> Tokushima </LOCATION> prefecture. Women voters were also angered by a new 3 percent consumption tax forced through parliament by the Liberal Democrats despite opposition protest. Women, angered by the tax because they faced higher prices in supermarkets, rallied under the slogan `` every day is tax payment day'' in facing ruling party incumbents and challengers. `` Women candidates made a favorable impression with their stance against the consumption tax and household issues,'' <PERSON> Yoshitomo </PERSON> <PERSON> Sakai </PERSON>, secretary-general of the Socialist's election committee, told <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION>. `` The popularity of <PERSON> Takako </PERSON> <PERSON> Doi </PERSON>, who made appearances in more than 90 places around the country, also had a big impact,'' <LOCATION> Sakai </LOCATION> was quoted as saying. <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> reported that preliminary returns showed that two women were elected each from among Liberal Democrats; <ORGANIZATION> Komeito </ORGANIZATION>, the No. 2 opposition Clean Government Party; and Rengo-no-kai, the labor confederation. Two women who were elected ran as independents and another ran as a communist.

Although he had climbed many peaks before his accident, <PERSON> Wellman </PERSON> had never tackled <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Capitan </PERSON>, considered a difficult ascent for fully able-bodied climbers.

 About one million Israeli civil servants, bank employees, and airport and factory workers walked off their jobs for two hours Sunday to protest rising unemployment. It was the strongest job action in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in recent years and reflected anger at a recession blamed in part on the Palestinian uprising in the occupied territories that began in December 1987. The strike, from 11 a.m. to 1 p.m., shut down hundereds of banks and government offices and disrupted flights at Ben-Gurion International Airport. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s jobless rate was 9.7 percent in May, the highest since a 1967 recession when the rate reached 12.4 percent. Union leaders say 140,000 workers are unemployed and that is the greatest number of people out of work in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s 41-year history. `` We want the government to hear the screams of the workers,'' said strike organizer <PERSON> Eli </PERSON> <PERSON> Sofer </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Jerusalem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. `` We are fearful for the fate of our country.'' <PERSON> Yisrael </PERSON> <PERSON> Kessar </PERSON>, secretary-general of the <ORGANIZATION> Histadrut </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION>, said of the strike, `` We decided we did n't have any choice but to take this action.''

 A bus driver and passenger were shot to death Sunday afternoon by a gunman who made his getaway by shooting and critically wounding a motorist, then taking the man's car, police said. The shooting happened around 1:30 p.m. in front of a busy supermarket in downtown Hollywood, across the street from the city's Greyhound Bus Station. <PERSON> Sidney </PERSON> <PERSON> Granger </PERSON>, a 43-year-old driver for the <ORGANIZATION> Broward </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION>, and a passenger on the transit bus were killed, said police spokeswoman <PERSON> Joycelyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Alston </PERSON>. A search was under way for the gunman. `` We do n't have a motive,'' Ms. <PERSON> Alston </PERSON> said. `` We do n't understand why this happened. Using what police believed to be an automatic weapon, the gunman boarded the bus when it stopped at a transfer station, shot the driver and sprayed bullets into the back of the bus, hitting and killing a passenger, Ms. <PERSON> Alston </PERSON> said. It was not immediately known how many people were on the bus. A bus passenger said all appeared normal until the shots rang out. `` He had a bottle of wine in his hand and I saw him get up and get ready to get on the bus,'' said <PERSON> Devin </PERSON> <PERSON> Oppy </PERSON>. `` Other people got on the bus and some others got off, and as soon as all that was over the guy just raised his arm and pow, pow, pow!'' The gunman left the bus, walked through the <ORGANIZATION> Publix </ORGANIZATION> Supermarket parking lot and accosted the driver of a car slowing for a stoplight, said police Lt. <PERSON> R.H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Banks </PERSON>. The man banged his gun on the car window, ordered the driver out and shot him three times, twice in the back, as the motorist got out, <PERSON> Banks </PERSON> said. As the gunman drove off, a 16-year-old service station attendant called for help, then tried to follow the man in his car. The teen-ager said he gave up the chase after a few blocks because the man was driving too fast. The attendant asked that his name not be made public. The wounded driver, whose name was not immediately released, was taken to nearby <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Memorial </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, where an administrator said he was in critical condition. The gunman was described by witnesses as white, about 30 years old, having dark hair in a pony tail and wearing a red plaid shirt and blue jeans, Ms. <PERSON> Alston </PERSON> said. Investigators examined the bus and the bodies on board as weeping relatives of the bus driver stood on a nearby sidewalk. Bus passenger <PERSON> Luc </PERSON> <PERSON> Laurent </PERSON>, 43, of nearby <LOCATION> Pompano </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> said he was dozing when the vehicle pulled into the transfer station. `` I woke up and heard the shots,'' said <PERSON> Laurent </PERSON>. `` I saw two guys on the floor, and everybody was getting off.'' After the shooting, the gunman `` did n't say anything,'' <PERSON> Laurent </PERSON> said. He said the man did n't ask for money or anything else. Hollywood is a suburb north of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>.

 A senior American diplomat suspected of passing information to the Soviets after being recalled from <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> first aroused <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> suspicions more than a decade ago, according to a close friend _ the Austrian foreign minister. <PERSON> Felix </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON>, the highest-ranking <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official ever implicated in an espionage investigation involving the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, remained out of sight Sunday even as additional bits and pieces emerged about his career _ which included a stint in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. More recently, he was the No. 2 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official at the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, serving at that post at the same time as a <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> guard subsequently convicted of espionage at the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. The Marine sergeant told investigators he first got involved with Soviet spies while he was posted in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>. Austrian Foreign Minister <PERSON> Alois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mock </PERSON>, a close friend and college-mate of <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON>'s, was quoted Sunday in a European tabloid as saying he first heard about the recent allegations of espionage three weeks ago through Austrian channels. However, he said there was `` a certain suspicion on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> side reaching back into the 1970s.'' President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, returning to the White House late Sunday from a weekend in Camp David, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, ignored reporters' shouted questions about the investigation. Neighbors told reporters that <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON> had been under obvious surveillance by the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> until news accounts of the spy probe aired late Friday and he disappeared from his plush apartment _ along with the agents who had followed him even when he walked his dog. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> reported Sunday night that <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON> was staying at a private home north of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> footage showed two women identified as his wife and daughter but not of <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> declined comment Sunday. However, sources had said earlier there were no plans to arrest <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON> over the weekend, implying that he remained under surveillance. In 1985, a former <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> agent, <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>, eluded <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents and fled to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> after being charged with selling intelligence secrets to Soviet <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> officials in <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>. Because <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON> had access to sensitive intelligence material during his seven-year posting in <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, officials expressed concern that he would be in a position to cause grave damage to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interests if he shared such secrets with foreign powers. There were no formal charges against <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON>, however, and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have declined in their public comments to go beyond confirming that he is the target of an intelligence investigation and no longer has access to the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> building. The career diplomat reportedly was filmed by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials earlier this year passing a brief case to a known Soviet <ORGANIZATION> KGB </ORGANIZATION> agent in a European city. <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> was not the only sensitive post where <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON> served. In 1974, he was economic counselor in the newly opened <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy in espionage-filled <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, where he arrived from <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. As events unfolded Sunday, what emerged was the vision of a disgruntled employee who, as the former No. 2 at the embassy in <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, had access to a wide array of sensitive mission material in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, long considered an East-West spy crossroads. Those who knew <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON> well ruled out spy-swaps for money or ideology. <PERSON> Mock </PERSON> said he was `` deeply shaken and really shattered.'' An administration source, familiar with <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON>'s career, said he was `` shocked.'' Sources told <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> _ which initially broke the story _ that <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON> claimed he spied because he fell into a Soviet sex trap but that investigators have discounted that story. Some sources pointed to his frustration over having been passed over for an ambassadorship after serving under political appointees in <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> and running the embassy in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> for a time. One of the ambassadors <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON> served was <PERSON> Helene </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Damm </PERSON>, an Austrian-born political appointee by former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> who caused a scandal in Viennese society by marrying <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Guertler </PERSON>, a hotel owner. She resigned in June 1985, citing speculation that her marriage constituted a conflict of interest with her diplomatic duties. <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON> ran the embassy after <PERSON> Von </PERSON> <PERSON> Damm </PERSON> resigned until <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lauder </PERSON> arrived almost a year later. <PERSON> Lauder </PERSON> told reporters Saturday that he demanded <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON> be recalled in July 1987 because of `` insubordination.'' The former ambassador said he knew nothing about espionage allegations, adding: `` If I thought he was a spy, I would have had him arrested.'' Officials attempted to assess the damage <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON> could have caused. <PERSON> Lauder </PERSON> confirmed <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON> had access to classified information, saying: `` There is enough information that he could do severe damage.'' Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, D-Ga., a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Select </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION>, said Sunday on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Meet the Press'' that he had not been briefed on the case, but `` if a high-ranking official of this nature was involved in spying for the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> it could be very damaging `` There's no doubt about the fact that the top people in the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, the top people in our embassy, have access to cables from around the word,'' said <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>. `` They have knowledge about certain <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> operations.'' Defense Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON>, interviewed Sunday on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` This Week With <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Brinkley </PERSON>, declined to comment on the depth of the possible breach of security, saying, `` It would be pure speculation at this point, and I really ca n't get into it. A <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> staffer said Sunday the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> apparently did not have enough evidence to arrest <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON> on criminal charges. In <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>, the newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Neue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kronen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zeitung </ORGANIZATION> noted that <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON> lived well in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> in a villa in one of the city's poshest districts and said he `` threw lots of parties for politicians, artists and journalists.'' Another paper, the <ORGANIZATION> Kaertner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tageszeitung </ORGANIZATION>, commented on the <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON> story, saying: `` Even <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> <PERSON> Greene </PERSON> could not have dreamed of such rich material, reaching right into the finest society circles and highest political posts of <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>.'' The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, meanwhile, reported Sunday that intelligence officials are re-examining their investigation of two Marine guards at the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and their involvement with Soviet agents for a possible link to the <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON> case. One of the <ORGANIZATION> Marines </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Lonetree </PERSON>, confessed he had become involved with Soviet intelligence at his previous posting in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>. As deputy chief of mission, <PERSON> Bloch </PERSON>, according to officials, had early knowledge of <PERSON> Lonetree </PERSON>'s confession. Three months after <PERSON> Lonetree </PERSON>'s confession was made public in January 1987, another <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> guard, <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Bracy </PERSON>, said he and <PERSON> Lonetree </PERSON> had allowed Soviet agents to enter the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> embassy's secure areas <PERSON> Bracy </PERSON> later retracted his statements, and charges against him were dropped.

 About 1,100 Soviet sailors on leave during a rare goodwill visit by three Soviet warships took a whirlwind tour of Americana on Sunday, handing out autographs and enjoying stomach-turning carnival rides. The sailors, accompanied by <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> chaperones, visited <LOCATION> Busch </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gardens </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Williamsburg </LOCATION> and local stores, and selected crewmen were taken aboard the aircraft carrier <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> for a tour. Meanwhile, streams of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> visitors boarded the Russian ships for tours. <PERSON> Wendy </PERSON> <PERSON> Webb </PERSON>, 17, of <LOCATION> Chesapeake </LOCATION> and a friend were corralled in a ship passageway by about 20 young Soviets who wanted their picture taken with the girls. `` This is the way to make peace, is n't it?'' Miss <PERSON> Webb </PERSON> asked. The Soviets took turns putting their hats on her and her friend's heads and posing for snapshots `` The response of the community so far has been absolutely phenomenal,'' Lt. Cmdr. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fleet </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said. `` I think the Soviets have been very happy with the reception they've been given.'' On Saturday, a Soviet song and dance troupe belted out a rendition of the Star Spangled Banner at the close of a performance at a waterfront park in <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION>. `` When they actually started singing our national anthem ... well, it was just overwhelming,'' said <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Sykes </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION>. `` The symbolism _ their red flag flying up there on the corner and all, while they're singing about ` the land of the free' _ well, it was too much.'' Groups of sailors also made stops at <LOCATION> Colonial </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Williamsburg </LOCATION> and such American institutions as a shopping mall, a discount store and a picnic. Some got a look at the <LOCATION> Oceana </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Naval </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Air </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Station </LOCATION> in nearby <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>. Busch Gardens' stomach-twisting rides were a hit with the sailors who visited the amusement park. The young seamen became something of an attraction for Americans at the park, who crowded around, asked for autographs and snapped pictures of family members posing with Soviets. <PERSON> Dimitrie </PERSON> <PERSON> Shtaingardt </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, a 20-year-old radio operator, said he enjoyed the day, especially the people he met. `` They were very nice,'' he said, groping for the right words in English. `` People very warm. I see all friends around me.'' <PERSON> Myron </PERSON> <PERSON> Smythe </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> approached the group of Soviet sailors and spoke to them in Russian learned from his grandfather. `` It's beautiful,'' <PERSON> Smythe </PERSON> said later. `` Talk about international relations, this is it right there.'' The Soviet guided missile cruiser Marshal <PERSON> Ustinov </PERSON>, the destroyer Otlichny and the tanker <PERSON> Gasanov </PERSON> docked Friday at the <LOCATION> Norfolk </LOCATION> base. The five-day visit is only the second by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> navy to this country since World War II.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> said Sunday an altercation aboard one of its jets occurred after the plane touched down and did not cause an aborted landing at <LOCATION> Logan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. The airline's explanation differed from an account given by the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> after interviewing the crew of Flight 358. Six people, including a counsel to the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jersey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, his wife and four <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> residents, were arrested at <LOCATION> Logan </LOCATION> after the fight. <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Sacks-Wilner </PERSON>, 39, of <LOCATION> Montgomery </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Township </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, and his wife, <PERSON> Joanne </PERSON>, 37, were arrested when the flight from <LOCATION> Trenton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, landed at 5:30 p.m. Saturday, according to state police Cpl. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Howley </PERSON>. `` They had a little brawl,'' he said. `` It started out as a husband and wife that were sort of running around the plane and making demands on the crew and being a general nuisance and hollering.'' The fight between the couple occurred in the air, and expanded to involve four other passengers, police said. The on-board confusion led the pilot of the 146-passenger MD-80 aircraft to give up on his first landing try, said Sgt. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelley </PERSON>. `` They were fighting in the aisles just prior to touch down,'' <PERSON> Kelley </PERSON> said. `` The pilot was afraid that when the pilot reversed throttle on his englines _ which you do not feel when you're in your seat _ the whole troop that was fighting in the aisles would have wound up in the cockpit.'' <PERSON> Kelley </PERSON> said state police based their explanation on interviews with the flight crew. He said the fight lasted 15 to 20 minutes. According to the airline, however, the fight began and ended after the jet landed at <LOCATION> Logan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. The jet had had to bypass its first landing because a <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> jet was slow in taxiing out of the way, said <PERSON> Ned </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. `` I have spoken with the captain who said there was a <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> plane on the runway that was slow to clear and resulted in his decision to do what they call a go-around,'' <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Ciccarelli </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, said Sunday that the <LOCATION> Logan </LOCATION> control tower heard nothing of an on-board altercation before the landing. `` The airplane, making a normal approach, was given a routine go-around because the airplane landing in front of him was slow in clearing the runway,'' <PERSON> Ciccarelli </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> has opened an investigation into the incident. Sacks-Wilner, the chief counsel for the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> minority in the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jersey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, faces charges of interference with a flight crew, disorderly conduct and three counts of assault on a police officer, <PERSON> Howley </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Sacks-Wilner </PERSON> allegedly fought back at police when they boarded the plane and arrested him. All those arrested were released from the state police lockup pending arraignment Monday in <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Sacks-Wilner </PERSON> and three <LOCATION> Medford </LOCATION> residents, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Federico </PERSON>, 50, his wife <PERSON> Camella </PERSON>, 48, their son <PERSON> John </PERSON>, 22, all face charges of interfering with a flight crew, as does <PERSON> John </PERSON>'s 19-year-old girlfriend, <PERSON> Laureen </PERSON> <PERSON> Belmonte </PERSON> of Revere, <PERSON> Howley </PERSON> said The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> passengers `` tried to assist the crew and wound up getting in the crew's way,'' the state police corporal said.

 Leftist Shining Path rebels shot and killed the mayor of a highlands town and attacked a major Andean mining complex in separate incidents, police said Sunday. <PERSON> Freddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Astete </PERSON>, mayor of <LOCATION> Tambo </LOCATION>, 140 miles east of <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>, was shot in the head by rebels Saturday. <PERSON> Astete </PERSON>, 34, was the 51st mayor killed in the insurgency that has torn this impoverished nation since 1980. Also Saturday, rebels attacked the mining center of <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Oroya </LOCATION>, blowing up banks, railroad tracks and an electricity generating station, police said. They said the attack paralyzed production in the important mining region 95 miles east of <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>, but that nobody was hurt. The rebels have attacked 138 mining operations in the past four years, leaving 24 people dead and costing the companies millions of dollars in damages and lost production, according to government figures. Losses to the mining sector since 1980, when the Shining Path first started the attacks, amount to $ 500 million, according to the government. The Maoist-inspired Shining Path began its insurgency near the highland city of <LOCATION> Ayacucho </LOCATION>, 235 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>, but the violence has since spread throughout much of the highlands and into the coca-growing area in the northeast jungles. In the past, rebels attacked the mines mainly to steal dynamite, but recent attacks appear aimed at destroying machinery and halting production. <LOCATION> Peru </LOCATION> receives most of its foreign exchange from mining exports.

At the site of Wednesday's crash of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airliunes </ORGANIZATION> Flight 232, officials were painstakingly reassembling the jet's tail section in hopes of determining what caused the sudden loss of hydraulic power, loss of control and the fiery airport crash. <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopatkiewicz </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, said investigators were focusing on cornfields 60 miles from the crash scene in hopes of recovering more pieces of the airliner's tail engine, which apparently exploded and severed hydraulic lines. `` Without having the fan section, it's obviously going to take a lot of time,'' he said. `` It's always best to get all the wreckage.'' Also Sunday, investigators continued to interview crew members. The flight engineer said that immediately after the explosion in the No. 2 engine, the gauges indicated the immediate loss of fluid in all three hydraulic systems, according to <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON>. Authorities were beginning the process of returning home the bodies of the crash victims. According to a list compiled with information from <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>, relatives and employers, 105 people were confirmed dead and five were still listed as missing. A spokesman for <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Branstad </PERSON> said more than 20 bodies had been sent home by Sunday. Hospital officials said 39 people remained hospitalized early Sunday, but some were being dismissed as the day progressed. <PERSON> Lopatkiewicz </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Nebraska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> jets were used to carry infrared cameras to photograph a 16-square-mile area about 60 miles from the crash site in a search for metal fragments thrown from the engine when it exploded. `` We hope those photographs will be able to detect metal that is strewn in thick cornfields in that area,'' he said. <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON> said the search for pieces had been hampered because some fell in areas where corn is up to 6 feet high. `` The areas of the cornfields have to be searched by ground,'' he said. `` Farmers have been asked to be alert for metal fragments. `` The people working the fields out there have been alerted,'' <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON> said. Investigators said they checked maintenance records on key sections of the engine. `` There's nothing here that gives us cause for concern at this point,'' said <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON>. `` Although I will say that previous accidents have led to reductions in cycles. So it's not to say that this is irrelevant.'' The age of engine parts is expressed in cycles, which comprise one landing and takeoff. Doctors were cautioning that crash victims face a long recovery, and <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> officials said they were making plans to aid families of the dead. `` Everybody who survived that crash is going to have a lot of potential for problems to overcome,'' said <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Foster </PERSON>, medical director of the burn unit at <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Luke </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. `` We're talking about many, many months of initial care and then years of rehabilitation if the patient survives,'' he said. While <PERSON> Foster </PERSON> said doctors were trying to move injured victims near their homes for lengthy therapy, some were n't willing to leave immediately. `` I could leave tomorrow if I wanted to, but I really do n't feel like moving,'' said <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON>, a burn victim from <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>. `` I'm very comfortable here I really do n't feel like traveling for a while.'' <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Guyette </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said the airline had assigned specialists to families of crash victims and gave each a separate <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> phone number to call with questions. `` We'll be maintaining positive contact with them,'' he said. `` We will assign a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> representative to each family.'' At the crash scene, while investigators pieced together the wreckage, others gathered luggage and other personal effects, storing it in a hangar for families to retrieve. `` We are taking great pains to collect everything we can, identify them and return them,'' <PERSON> Guyette </PERSON> said.

 <PERSON> Rebecca </PERSON> <PERSON> Schaeffer </PERSON>, the young actress shot point blank as she opened her front door, was buried Sunday in her hometown on a breezy hilltop fragrant with flowers. About 250 people ringed the gravesite shaded by tall pines as the vault was lowered into the ground at <LOCATION> Ahavia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Shalom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cemetery </LOCATION>. Her parents, <PERSON> Benson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Danna </PERSON> <PERSON> Schaeffer </PERSON>, then dropped shovels of dirt into the opening. <PERSON> Schaeffer </PERSON>, 21, was slain Tuesday at her apartment building in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. A fan, who had sent her a blizzard of letters, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bardo </PERSON>, was arrested in <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, a day later and charged with the murder. <PERSON> Schaeffer </PERSON>'s burial followed a 45-minute service in the small cemetery chapel south of downtown <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>. Rabbi <PERSON> Emanuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> opened the service with a reading of the 23rd Psalm and then spoke of anger and anguish. He told <PERSON> Schaeffer </PERSON>'s parents they should not retain their anger toward the man that gunned down their daughter. `` Our experience, over the long run, can not be one of anger,'' <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> said. `` Anger gets us nowhere.'' He said the truth of <PERSON> Schaeffer </PERSON>'s death was difficult, but the truth of her life was that she had been a very special person and friends and family had all felt gifted with a special relationship in knowing her. The light wood casket at front right side of the room was adorned with a spray of white, blue and mauve flowers gathered with a mauve ribbon. Copies of her writing, leaflets of a few white pages of thoughts and poems tied with ribbon, were circulated among family members. `` I do it because it is right for me. ... Life is not a movie,'' she wrote earlier this month. Two friends, a young man and a young woman, stood to read lines from her writing. The young man, <PERSON> Brad </PERSON> <PERSON> Silberling </PERSON>, broke into tears and said he had wanted to marry <PERSON> Schaeffer </PERSON>, whom he called `` a sparkling soul.'' He sobbed as told the mourners, `` She always said, ` I want you to hold me so close.' Please, hold her ` so close' in your hearts.'' A second rabbi likened her writings to those of another young woman, <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, and said both had been `` snuffed out by a senseless society.'' Among the mourners were <PERSON> Schaeffer </PERSON>'s co-stars on her TV series, `` My Sister Sam'' _ <PERSON> Pam </PERSON> <PERSON> Dawber </PERSON>, <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jenny </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Hara </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dawber </PERSON> was accompanied by her husband, film actor <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Harmon </PERSON>. <PERSON> Schaeffer </PERSON> had been appearing before cameras professionally for more than half her life. Born in <LOCATION> Eugene </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, she began modeling in <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION> at the age of 14. She left home at 16 to try for a career in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. At 19, she won the role of <PERSON> Patti </PERSON> <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> in `` My Sister <PERSON> Sam </PERSON>,'' which ran from 1986 to 1988. Then, there were movie roles. She played <PERSON> Jacqueline </PERSON> <PERSON> Bisset </PERSON>'s daughter in <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Bartel </PERSON>'s recently released `` Scenes From The Class Struggle in <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>. She had just completed a co-starring role in `` One Point of View,'' a feature film directed by <PERSON> Dyan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cannon </PERSON>.

We at <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> feel deeply your pain and loss. We have lost members of the United family. And we offer thanks for those who were spared,'' <PERSON> Traub </PERSON> said. An estimated 90 Coloradans were aboard the jetliner, which was en route from <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> when it crashed. At least 30 were believed to have died. `` We are learning with one another to remember one another in ways we are not used to,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Horn </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Denver </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Churches </ORGANIZATION>, which organized the service. `` Part of grief is learning that we are truly human.''

 Prime Minister <PERSON> Sousuke </PERSON> <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> said Monday he will resign to take responsibility for his party's overwhelming defeat in parliamentary elections. <PERSON> Uno </PERSON>, who has been in office less than two months, did not specify when he would step down in the brief announcement on national television. He said he was resigning because the `` ultimate responsibility is mine'' for the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s defeat in Sunday's elections. In losing seats to the Socialists, the governing party lost the upper house of Parliament for the first time in 34 years. `` It was a very difficult election,'' Uno said. <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> referred to public criticism of the party over the Recruit influence-peddling scandal, a new 3 percent consumption tax and liberalization of agricultural imports as factors contributing to the defeat. He also was severely criticized during his short tenure for allegedly keeping paid mistresses. `` The people delivered their verdict, although we were not able to fully debate policy issues with the opposition,'' Uno said. `` We will listen modestly -LRB- to the verdict -RRB-, and reflect on what we should do.'' He said he would remain in office until his successor is selected, which he said he hoped could be done `` promptly.'' The prime minister's departure will mean the resignation of the entire Cabinet and a restructuring of the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s leadership. The conservative party conceded defeat on Sunday. `` We were beaten, and all I can say is that the -LRB- opposition -RRB- did splendidly,'' the party's secretary-general, <PERSON> Ryutaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Hashimoto </PERSON> said. `` This is the result of the people's choice,'' said opposition leader <PERSON> Takako </PERSON> <PERSON> Doi </PERSON>, whose Socialists gained more seats than the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION>, according to projections. The setback was expected to increase pressure for elections for the more powerful lower house of parliament. They are not due until July 1990. Voters decided half of the upper house's 252 seats in Sunday's balloting <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> said Monday that its projections so far showed that the Socialists would win 42 seats and the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> 33. Eleven seats were projected for the new labor-based <ORGANIZATION> Confederation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, eight for the Clean Government Party, three for the centrist <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialists </ORGANIZATION>, three for the Communists and the rest for independents and minor parties. The Socialists needed to win 84 seats for a majority in the upper house but ran only 54 candidates, so they led efforts to create an opposition coalition with the <ORGANIZATION> Clean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialists </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION>. Final returns were expected Monday evening. Without control of the upper house, the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> would find it harder to pass legislation. The chamber can defeat bills, and it can delay but not veto the budget and diplomatic treaties. A loss in the lower house also threatens the Liberal Democrats' hold on the prime ministry for the first time since the party was formed in 1955 The lower house chooses the prime minister. A heavy turnout by <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s 90.3 million eligible voters reflected strong feelings over scandals and other issues that have eroded the popularity of the Liberal Democrats. <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> resigned as prime minister last month to take responsibility for the Recruit scandal, in which the <ORGANIZATION> Recruit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> publishing conglomerate was accused of doling out millions of dollars in underpriced stocks and political donations to obtain favors. Uno, <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s successor, has been battered by allegations that for as long as 10 years he kept paid mistresses. He has not denied the allegations but has denied he did anything immoral. The accusations forced <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> to keep a low profile during the campaign. The Liberal Democrats also have suffered because farmers, traditional supporters of the party, opposed government moves to open <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s agricultural market wider to imports. The Socialists rallied voters against the new 3 percent sales tax that was heavily backed by the governing party. The Socialists, putting forward a record number of women candidates, took advantage of homemakers' anger over the tax, which was bulldozed through Parliament by the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> last year despite an opposition boycott. The tax took effect April 1. Although Ms. <PERSON> Doi </PERSON> is immensely popular, her party has been widely accused of lacking a realistic and unified platform, partly because of a small but radical faction. In the past, it has called for <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to disband its Self-Defense Forces and scrap the <ORGANIZATION> U.S.-Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION>, under which about 64,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops are stationed in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. Socialist leaders now say they would not immediately do away with the armed forces, and that they seek only to revise the treaty. But Ms. <PERSON> Doi </PERSON> and others have said all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warships entering Japanese ports should be inspected and denied entry if nuclear arms are found.

 Two burning railroad tank cars kept hundreds of people away from home for a second day Sunday as hazardous materials experts decided the safest course was to let the chemical fires burn themselves out. One of the cars that caught fire in the 14-car derailment Saturday burned itself out Sunday afternoon, but the other was still aflame, said <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lindsey </PERSON> <PERSON> Leckie </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> CSX </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which owns the train. The experts believed the second fire would burn itself out overnight, and extended the evacuation of a 15-square-mile area until sometime Monday, <PERSON> Leckie </PERSON> said. Monitoring around the burning tank cars found no dangerous levels of toxic chemicals, and no long-term effects to homes or possessions were anticipated, <PERSON> Leckie </PERSON> said. The burning cars did not threaten other chemical-laden cars in the 32-car train, <PERSON> Leckie </PERSON> said earlier. Railroad officials examined the wreck from the air, and members of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> arrived in the area about 100 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, between <LOCATION> Midland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Saginaw </LOCATION>. The derailment's cause was n't known. <PERSON> Leckie </PERSON> said the train was traveling at about 37 mph when it derailed. He said the track was most recently inspected by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railroad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> CSX </ORGANIZATION> engineers last Tuesday. The accident sent a fireball and a huge column of smoke into the air, and the fire that followed destroyed two homes. No serious injuries were reported. Ten to 15 people were treated at hospitals for smoke inhalation and released, <PERSON> Leckie </PERSON> said. Officials said there was no way of knowing how many people left their homes, since many chose to stay with friends or relatives rather than in shelters. Estimates ranged up to about 2,000 people as evacuees filled hotels and occupied two <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> shelters. <ORGANIZATION> CSX </ORGANIZATION> was paying for motel rooms, meals and emergency clothing for the displaced families, <PERSON> Leckie </PERSON> said. The hazardous materials team found a large gash in another tank car, which contained naphtha. The highly flammable material apparently was the source of the fireball, and probably burned itself out Saturday, <PERSON> Leckie </PERSON> said. The car that stopped burning Sunday contained acrylic acid, a chemical used to make plastics, which irritates the skin and is toxic if inhaled. The other contained chlorosilene, a flammable liquid product made by <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a joint venture between <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and Corning Glass Works. The train was on a scheduled run from <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Huron </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Midland </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Black </PERSON> said some of the chemicals on the train were going to the <ORGANIZATION> Midland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cogeneration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Venture </ORGANIZATION>, in which <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Consumers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> are partners. The project is converting the utility company's never-finished nuclear power plant to a gas-fired plant to generate electricity and steam. Some evacuees at a local high school said they were forced from their homes so quickly they could n't grab a change of clothing. Residents of about 60 homes at the <ORGANIZATION> Avondale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mobile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> said authorities rushed them out of the park in <LOCATION> Freeland </LOCATION>, about 1 -LCB- miles from the blaze. `` They pulled us out before it got too bad. We were starting to smell it when the police came around,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bauder </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bauder </PERSON> said that when he left he looked back and saw a billow of black smoke so huge, `` it was like a tornado.'' `` The cloud was directly overhead. There was the smell of burnt insulation,'' said mobile home resident <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>. <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Mobley </PERSON>, 25, was evacuated twice Saturday, first to a <LOCATION> Midland </LOCATION> elementary school. A few hours later, fumes from the fire headed that way, and she was sent to the high school. `` We're resigned to at least two nights here,'' she said. `` I've been told so many stories, I do n't know which one to believe. <ORGANIZATION> CSX </ORGANIZATION> is headquartered in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Sousuke </PERSON> <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> probably wo n't go down in history as holding <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s premiership for the shortest time since World War II. That dubious distinction now goes to <PERSON> Tanzan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ishibashi </PERSON>, whose tenure lasted only a bit over two months. But <PERSON> Uno </PERSON>'s will be one of the shortest. Here is a chronology of his unexpected rise and fall: MAY 28 _ Uno, then foreign minister, leaves for <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> to attend international conferences while <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> elders decide he will replace former Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> after their first choice, <PERSON> Masayoshi </PERSON> <PERSON> Ito </PERSON>, declines. JUNE 2 _ Parliament confirms <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> as prime minister. <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> says he will follow a policy of political reform to win back popularity for his party following the damaging Recruit influence-peddling scandal that forced <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> to resign. JUNE 5 _ The <ORGANIZATION> Sunday </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mainichi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> magazine </ORGANIZATION> breaks a taboo on disclosing details of politicians' private lives and publishes an article alleging Uno kept a paid geisha mistress. The allegation does not hurt Uno until foreign news media pick up the story and it is published outside <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. The Japanese media then give it wider dissemination. JUNE 9 _ Uno is embarrassed in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> when an opposition Socialist member questions him about the geisha allegation. He declines to respond, fueling a barrage of criticism from women's organizations JUNE 28 _ After more published allegations of extra-marital affairs, news reports say that <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> told a party leadership meeting he can not continue in office. But the reports say he is persuaded to remain as premier. JULY 14-16 _ Representing <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> at the <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> economic summit of the seven major industrialized democracies, <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> promises greater aid for the developing world and strong efforts to protect the environment. JULY 23 _ Elections are held for half the seats in the upper house of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> amid predictions that <PERSON> Uno </PERSON> will resign if his party fares poorly. It does, losing its majority for the first time in 34 years. JULY 24 _ Uno says he will resign, but does not immediately set a date. As was the case before the party chose him as leader, there is no obvious candidate among the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> to replace him. He says he will remain in office until the search ends, which could take weeks.

<DATELINE>SMYRNA, Tenn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Weaver </PERSON> has worked in about 500 organizing campaigns in 38 years with the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION>, but he says he's never seen anything quite like <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION>'s response to a union drive at its only <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> plant. As described by <PERSON> Weaver </PERSON>, the Japanese company's tactics sound like a cross between jury selection and political campaigning. About 2,400 hourly workers are scheduled to vote Wednesday and Thursday on <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> representation at the 8-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> U.S.A. </ORGANIZATION> plant, one of three non-union <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> plants owned by Japanese automakers. <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> is a right-to-work state, so-called because of laws that unions say limit their activity. That might seem to make organizing in <LOCATION> Smyrna </LOCATION> different from organizing in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>. But <PERSON> Weaver </PERSON> said that has n't been a problem for the <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION>. Rather, the challenge for the union has been to combat tactics by the Japanese automaker that are usually not seen in this country. `` First of all, they screened their employees carefully on their family's union background,'' <PERSON> Weaver </PERSON> said. `` I'm told they promised them employment for life. Then they started the line speed real slow, then speeded it up.'' <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> also has a high-tech advantage that union organizers could not counter: Television monitors play pro-company messages constantly in employee break rooms. <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> officials declined to discuss the organizing effort in detail. `` We've got a policy. We just do n't want to conduct this election in the media. We've been trying to be quiet,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> U.S.A. </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Benefield </PERSON>. `` Trying to answer -LRB- UAW -RRB- questions is kind of like being in a contest between union and management. But it's not. It's a contest between the union and the employees.'' The union's national office has beefed up its organizing staff in <LOCATION> Smyrna </LOCATION> for the final two weeks of the campaign from about 10 to around 35 <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> workers from across the country, said local <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Maxey </PERSON> <PERSON> Irwin </PERSON>. The union representatives and members of the in-plant organizing committee went on `` house calls'' to persuade <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> employees to vote for the union. Worker injuries and assembly line speeds have emerged as the campaign's main issues. <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> lawyers notified the <ORGANIZATION> Tennessee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> that the company would appeal a state order to release <ORGANIZATION> Occupational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> logs that detail worker injuries. The state <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> issued a citation and levied a $ 5,000 fine against <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> for refusal to release that information. The appeals process could take three to six months, long after the union election is held. `` Everybody's focusing on this as a make-or-break situation for American labor. But business is looking at <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION>'s refusal -LRB- to release the logs -RRB- as a major blunder,'' <PERSON> Irwin </PERSON> said. Dr. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Silverstein </PERSON>, assistant director of health and safety for the <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION>, said in June that as many as one in five <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> workers was injured on the job and lost a work day because of it last year. In April, <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> officials reported a worker injury or illness rate of 8.9 per 100 workers for 1987 _ less than half the rate claimed by the union. A company spokeswoman in June said the company stands by its calculations of worker injury rates. She declined further comment. <PERSON> Dottie </PERSON> <PERSON> Lockhart </PERSON>, a production technician at the <LOCATION> Smyrna </LOCATION> plant, said she did n't know of any injuries during the four years she has worked there. `` I ca n't think of anybody that's been hurt or been out of work or had to lose any time at all. It's not heaven up there, but it's not a killing job either,'' <PERSON> Lockhart </PERSON> said `` I've worked at harder places and made less money.'' <PERSON> Lockhart </PERSON> said production line speed is not a problem. But she cited a new production line task with which workers had trouble. `` We had a job and we thought it was too hard. And we said something about it, and <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> did something about it. They changed the job, made it better, made it easier,'' she said. Union representatives have said <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION>'s workers make about $ 7,900 less a year in pay and benefits than their counterparts at <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. But the issue goes beyond just pay and benefits at one plant, some argue. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Norris </PERSON>, executive director of the conservative <ORGANIZATION> Tennessee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roundtable </ORGANIZATION>, said the state's economic potential would be diminished should the <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> represent <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> workers. `` I think one reason many industries have located here is that we're a right-to-work state, and anything we can do to preserve that makes <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> more attractive.''

<HEAD>Hard To Detect The Stealth In Seattle</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A crucial vote on the B-2 bomber is due in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> this week, but there's been little concern voiced in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> about the future of a program that involves thousands of local workers and means billions of dollars for the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` That's a tough one,'' <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Hobson </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Seattle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said last week when asked whether there had been much discussion of the B-2's fate by <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>'s business community. `` To be honest, I have n't heard anybody locally talk about it at all.'' For <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advanced </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION>, the division of Seattle-based <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> building parts of the stealth bomber in the city, talk about the top-secret project has been sparse and carefully phrased. Advanced Systems spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kvasnosky </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>'s role is worth `` some billions of dollars, but we have n't released specifics.'' Likewise, he would n't say exactly what B-2 parts <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> makes, and would only say `` in excess of 5,000'' <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> employees work on the project. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> is the largest of nine <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state subcontractors and suppliers for the B-2. Nationwide, prime contractor <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> says, tens of thousands of people at 156 companies in 46 states are involved in the plane, which is assembled at <LOCATION> Palmdale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>. Both the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> this week take up the defense authorizaion bill, which includes nearly $ 4 billion for the B-2. There's been strong opposition raised to the B-2 by members of both parties, who are balking at the $ 70 billion for the 132 B-2s sought by the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>. One of the bomber's staunchest supporters is Rep. <PERSON> Norm </PERSON> <PERSON> Dicks </PERSON>, D-Wash., who says the program is of major importance to <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> and to the future of the aerospace industry `` We're talking about 8,700 jobs in the <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> area,'' <PERSON> Dicks </PERSON> said last week. `` <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> is a major subcontractor. They're doing the wings on the B-2. It's a major, revolutionary new technology.'' The B-2 makes extensive use of new, lightweight, composite materials in its construction, in part to absorb radar waves to make the plane harder to detect. <PERSON> Dicks </PERSON> said the $ 22 billion to $ 23 billion already spent on the B-2 program not only is buying planes but pays for research and development into composite materials and aircraft design that can be used in other defense projects and in commercial aviation. `` All of that will have enormous spinoff to the one sector where the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> still has superiority over all of the world,'' <PERSON> Dicks </PERSON> said, referring to the aviation industry. `` I hate to see that lost.'' Deduct the research and development costs, and the price of a single B-2 comes down to about $ 260 million from the $ 530 million figure usually cited, he said. <PERSON> Kvasnosky </PERSON> said it was premature to speculate what might happen to B-2 workers if the program is canceled or extensively cut back. However, it's likely many employees could be absorbed elsewhere within <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>, which has been scrambling for experienced workers on its commercial aircraft side. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commercial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airplanes </ORGANIZATION> has had five straight years of record orders. Several aerospace industry analysts begged off commenting on <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> and the B-2, saying there just was n't enough hard information. But <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Nisbet </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, ventured `` a rough guestimate'' that the split among key companies in the B-2 program could be 60 to 65 percent for <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION>, 25 percent for engine-maker <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, 15 to 20 percent for <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> and smaller shares to <ORGANIZATION> LTV </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>. <PERSON> Nisbet </PERSON> speculated that remaining work on a fully funded B-2 program could mean $ 8 billion to $ 10 billion for <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>, and possibly close to $ 1 billion in profit. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> has not given out any financial breakdown on the B-2, but <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION> revealed that the bomber accounted for $ 657 million, or about half its overall sales, for its first quarter this year. <PERSON> Nisbet </PERSON> agreed with <PERSON> Dicks </PERSON> that technology being developed for the stealth could be valuable, especially on the Advanced Tactical Fighter, a 21st century warplane that <ORGANIZATION> Advanced </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> hopes to build with <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> for the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>. `` No question about it, they're blazing a trail in technology. There wo n't be any more weapons systems built that wo n't incorporate some of the technology of this research. The B-2 made its first flight last week, and a second bomber is to start flight tests next month. Ten more B-2s are under construction.

 Like the stealth bomber it's helping to build, the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s lobbying effort on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> to save funding for the secretive bomber has been, until recently, almost invisible. Lawmakers and congressional staff said that despite the Seattle-based aerospace company's major stake in the B-2 program, it has only been in the past week or so that <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> lobbyists have contacted members. `` They are weighing in now and it is timely,'' said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Norm </PERSON> <PERSON> Dicks </PERSON>, D-Wash., a member of the defense subcommittee of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appropriations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and a B-2 supporter The debate over the stealth bomber appropriation is scheduled to reach the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> floor this week as members consider amendments that range from gutting the program to less crippling reductions in funding. Several congressional staffers, who asked not to be identified, said <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>'s lobbying is usually the most low-keyed of all the aerospace defense contractors. `` The difference is that <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> is diversified and has a huge backlog of commercial aircraft orders while the others do n't,'' said one staffer. `` The defense contracts are important to <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>, but it is not life and death.'' <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> all have more `` heavy-handed'' lobbying reputations because so much of their business is connected with the military, the staffer said. <PERSON> Dicks </PERSON> and other lawmakers said <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> had concentrated its lobbying on preserving funding for the V-22 Osprey, a short landing and takeoff troop carrier for the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Helicopters </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> is one of the prime contractors on that project. `` Now that we are down to it on the B-2, they are working hard,'' said <PERSON> Dicks </PERSON>, adding that he had personally contacted more than 150 members to urge them to support the B-2. <PERSON> Dicks </PERSON> is a true believer in the stealth bomber, defending it as a `` capable, effective deterrent'' that, while expensive, is so sophisticated it will eventually render Soviet air defenses useless. <PERSON> Dicks </PERSON> is also well aware of the impact it will have in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state. `` I tell members up front that <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state has a stake in this,'' said <PERSON> Dicks </PERSON>. `` But I want to make sure they are aware of the national security implications.'' <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> officials are typically closed mouth about their lobbying efforts and the stealth bomber is no exception. `` We do n't discuss it,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> spokesman here. <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON> did say that <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> lobbyists were contacting about 30 congressmen, adding, `` We do n't necessarily try to sell a program, we just keep people informed.'' <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Shrontz </PERSON> was also reportedly making phone calls to key congressmen at week's end. One of those who met with <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> lobbyists last week was Rep. <PERSON> Rod </PERSON> <PERSON> Chandler </PERSON>, R-Wash., who said the pitch was about 50 percent on the national security need for the bomber and about 50 percent on its importance to <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> `` They are very effective and tried to defuse all the arguments,'' said <PERSON> Chandler </PERSON>, adding that he also received a brochure on the B-2 program prepared by the <ORGANIZATION> Northrop </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the lead contractor. <PERSON> Chandler </PERSON>, as of late last week, said he was undecided how he will vote on the stealth funding amendments.

 Striking <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> flight attendants on Sunday picketed the <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> terminal of sister carrier <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, trying to heighten public awareness of their 4-month-old walkout. The picket was organized by labor consultant <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>, whose tactics have been controversial in other labor actions. About 30 flight attendants, who have been on strike since March 4, marched along with their children and other family members at the <LOCATION> Logan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> terminal. Eastern and <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> are subsidiaries of <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, whose chairman, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>, has been the chief target of criticism from the stikers. The picketers said they were particularly targeting passengers who took advantage of <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>'s special $ 1 fares for children under age 18. The special was in effect for passengers who purchased tickets for their children before June. Children walking the picket line carried balloons and signs with such messages as `` Lorenzo is a stinker'' and `` <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> is a bozo.'' `` We're here to bring to the attention of the public our strike,'' said <PERSON> Dolores </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>, an Eastern flight attendant for 15 years. `` We're here with our children because we have families too and we know of what we speak.'' The strikers had a permit to picket in front of the terminal and passengers moved through to the busy ticket counter without incident. Many were handed leaflets by <PERSON> Rand </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Rogers </ORGANIZATION>' New York-based labor consulting firm, the Corporate Campaign. The leaflets detailed alleged safety and service shortcomings of <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> and Eastern. <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Ned </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> declined to comment on the picketing, saying it was primarily a matter between Eastern and the strikers. <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> was hired by the flight attendants union in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> to help raise public awareness of the strike. He has stirred up controversy in other strikes for advocating confrontational tactics. The Corporate Campaign strategy involves focusing public attention on affiliates and major customers of a company involved in a strike to try to apply economic pressure to management. Eastern filed for protection under federal bankruptcy laws after the strike severely curtailed its operations.

 Corona Extra, that trendy, pricey Mexican beer you wash down with a lime, has lost some appeal among <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> yuppies and forced its brewer to seek other customers, namely light-beer drinkers and the Japanese. In a new advertising campaign, the American promoters of <PERSON> Corona </PERSON> are peddling a new light brew. They're also stressing <PERSON> Corona </PERSON>'s tropical Mexican roots and the heavier version's popularity with seasoned <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> surfers `` The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market is flat because of lifestyle changes,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazzoni </PERSON>, executive vice president and general manager of Chicago-based <ORGANIZATION> Barton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beers </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, which imports <PERSON> Corona </PERSON> to the western <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> from <ORGANIZATION> Cervecerias </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Modelo </ORGANIZATION>, the brewer. `` There's a new emphasis on fitness, and sales are flat with the yuppies,'' whose purchases once enabled <PERSON> Corona </PERSON> to threaten Dutch brew <ORGANIZATION> Heineken </ORGANIZATION> as the No. 1 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> import, <PERSON> Mazzoni </PERSON> said in an interview. <PERSON> Corona </PERSON> sells for about $ 5 a six-pack in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market, more than double what it costs in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. It seemed to draw style-conscious affluent young Americans like a magnet with its clear long-neck bottles and the <LOCATION> Mexican </LOCATION> custom of downing some alcoholic beverages with a squeeze of lime. The Mexican beer's stagnant sales in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> partly reflect a decline in alcoholic beverage drinking by many Americans, which is affecting rival brews as well. At 2.4 billion cases, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> beer market grew negligibly over 1987, while imports rose just 0.4 percent after two years of strong growth. <PERSON> Corona </PERSON>'s sales in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market peaked in 1987 at nearly 25 million cases. Last year sales totaled about 22 million cases, according to statistics compiled by Impact, a newsletter about the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> beverage industry. <ORGANIZATION> Heineken </ORGANIZATION> sold more than 34 million cases in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in both 1987 and 1988. The Mexican beer's hold on the No. 2 spot is secure, and sales still far exceed 1984, when the brewer sold about 1.5 million cases in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. But the stalled growth has provoked concern. `` We've really been clobbered over the past year,'' <PERSON> Mazzoni </PERSON> said. `` We need some excitement.'' Modelo hopes to stir something up by introducing what hardened beer drinkers may consider a contradiction in terms: Corona Light. `` It's the final evolution in light,'' said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> McNichols </PERSON>, <PERSON> Barton </PERSON>'s marketing director. While total <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> beer consumption has n't grown, light brews are becoming more popular. For the first time, three of the five top-selling brands are lights and the trend has carried over into imports. <PERSON> Modelo </PERSON> shipped its first case of Corona Light northward in April and began test-marketing in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. Eventually, a new plant in <LOCATION> Guadalajara </LOCATION> will produce up to 400,000 cases of Corona Light a month. `` There are people who say <PERSON> Corona </PERSON>'s already light. But I ca n't tell you how many times I've heard people say _ wrongly _ they're worried about its calorie content,'' said <PERSON> Corona </PERSON> averages about 148 calories a bottle, the brewer says, despite rumors it's as high as 400 calories. The light variety's calorie content is 105 Modelo and its <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> distributors, <PERSON> Barton </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Gambrinis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Importing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>, plan to duplicate marketing tactics used to promote Corona Light's heavier cousin: relying at first on word-of-mouth advertising by introducing the brand in trendy restaurants and bars. The successful and voiceless <PERSON> Corona </PERSON> television ads, filmed in such tropical resorts as <LOCATION> Ixtapa </LOCATION>, also will be used to tout Corona Light, <ORGANIZATION> McNichols </ORGANIZATION> said. The brewer also is trying to counter its slippage in the American market by reaching out to drinkers in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Corona </PERSON> sells for $ 7.40 a bottle. `` We're going after young adults, the opinion leaders and what we call the ` sensitive trend leaders,''' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamaguchi </PERSON>, import marketing director for <ORGANIZATION> Hiroya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s oldest liquor merchant `` There's the opinion leader: the one always with the latest news, fashions and hairstyles and who drink <PERSON> Corona </PERSON> because it's a new thing,'' <PERSON> Hamaguchi </PERSON> said. `` Then there's the sensitive trend leaders. <PERSON> Corona </PERSON>'s a very sophisticated item in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, especially in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> night clubs,'' he said. `` That's where the sensitive trend leaders go.'' Since it introduced <PERSON> Corona </PERSON> to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> in July 1987, <PERSON> Hiroya </PERSON> sold 130,000 cases of <PERSON> Corona </PERSON> through 1988, making the beer the No. 5 import and 10th overall. `` We want 1 million cases five years from now,'' <PERSON> Hamaguchi </PERSON> said. Unlike the Western ad pitch, the Japanese ad campaign is full of words. In fact it features a man singing singing about what he likes and how <PERSON> Corona </PERSON> fits: I like two-branch roads in the middle of the city A rhythm that stimulates the right side of my brain A melody that has lost the code begins to be heard If I take the right road, it'll lead me to the end of the ground If I take the left road, it'll lead me to the end of the sea ... In my left hand I've got a lime In my right hand, I've got a Corona ... At this moment, I'm in the bottle of paradise.

<HEAD>Study Says Rain Improved Outlook for Corn Crop</HEAD>
<DATELINE>COLUMBIA, Mo. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Recent rains in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> have boosted the prospects for a larger corn crop, and that could have important implications for a wide spectrum of other commodities, according to study. The study, released Friday by the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Missouri-Columbia </ORGANIZATION>, says the rain has increased the possibility that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corn farmers this fall will harvest a 118 bushel-per-acre corn crop, totaling about 7.8 billion bushels. Previously, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> projected a 113 bushel-per-acre crop, totaling about 7.5 billion bushels. That 4 percent difference in yield could mean a 12 percent or larger drop in corn prices, said <PERSON> Abner </PERSON> <PERSON> Womack </PERSON>, director of the university's Food and <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Womack </PERSON> said that if the higher corn yields materialize, the average prices farmers receive for the crop would drop to about $ 1.75 a bushel from the $ 2 the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> had projected. Any change in corn prices is important because corn is the country's most widely planted farm crop. Corn also is the biggest source of livestock feed for meat, milk and egg producers. An unexpectedly large corn crop would tend to depress prices for other crops. That would require federal farm program officials to make higher price support payments, which would leave less money to help farmers with drought relief. No one yet knows exactly how much corn farmers will produce this year because whether it rains in the next two weeks could swing final production either way, <PERSON> Womack </PERSON> said. Much of the country's crop is in the pollination stage, which means that cool, damp weather is needed so that more kernels will form on the corn ears that farmers will harvest this fall. `` Right now, we're leaning on the side of larger crops and lower prices, but that still could change quickly,'' <PERSON> Womack </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Workers Changing Signs on RCA Building</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> NEW </LOCATION> <LOCATION> YORK </LOCATION> _ Somewhere over the <ORGANIZATION> Rainbow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Room </ORGANIZATION>, sometime in the next two months, the RCA Building will become, unmistakably, the GE Building. The huge, red neon `` RCA'' signs are being dismantled from the top of the 70-story building in favor of a red neon `` GE'' _ a move that, initially, did not put <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in a good light. But the grumbling that greeted the announced name change last summer subsided, the city gave its blessing and now workers are removing all signs of the old <ORGANIZATION> RCA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> on the limestone centerpiece of Rockefeller Center. A slab of granite with `` RCA Building'' chiseled into it was removed Friday from one of the entrances. Two weeks ago workers started taking down the neon signs that face south, west and north. GE bought RCA and its network television division, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, in 1986. <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, which is headquartered in the building, announced last July that the building's name and signs would be changed. The building is owned by <ORGANIZATION> Rockefeller </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. `` I guarantee you a lot of people are n't going to notice,'' said <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Gould </PERSON>, a partner in the graphics firm <ORGANIZATION> Lebowitz-Gould-Design </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, which designed the new neon signs. `` It will be the same color, the same glass,'' she said. The new letters will be in outlined block italics, inspired by an old <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> monogram _ not the familiar script logo found on GE products. The changeover, expected to be finished by September, received approval last fall from the city <ORGANIZATION> Landmarks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Preservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, which had input into the design of the new neon. Some who groaned at the thought of a new sign last summer may not have known that the current RCA sign was installed in 1968, replacing the original 1937 <PERSON> Art </PERSON> <PERSON> Decosign </PERSON> during an RCA `` corporate image'' makeover, <PERSON> Gould </PERSON> noted. Several other buildings in Rockefeller Center also have changed names since the 1930s when the complex was built, <PERSON> Gould </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Federal Agents Search Files at Georgia Power</HEAD>

 Federal agents armed with a search warrant took a personal computer, a printer and computer diskettes from the office of <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s chief financial officer, the company said. <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Altman </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> agents came to the office of <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Harreld </PERSON>, the company's vice president and comptroller, Friday afternoon and left about three hours later with the computer equipment and software `` We do n't know exactly what -LRB- software -RRB- they took,'' <PERSON> Altman </PERSON> said. `` Obviously this is related to the ongoing investigation'' of <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION>'s parent firm, The <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> has been investigating allegations of tax fraud, theft, cover-ups and illegal political contributions by officials and employees at Southern subsidiaries for more than three years. The probe heated up in August when a federal grand jury in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> also began looking into the finances of Southern and subsidiaries. Federal agents also raided <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> offices at that time. <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said the agency could not `` confirm or deny'' that a raid occurred Friday. <PERSON> Altman </PERSON> said <PERSON> Harreld </PERSON>, who is in charge of all the company's financial statements, would have no comment `` We really were very surprised at the search warrant,'' <PERSON> Altman </PERSON> said. `` We have been cooperating fully with the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's office on this investigation and we find it very surprising that they would feel the need to use a search warrant for materials that they perhaps could have gotten otherwise. The full scope of the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> and grand jury investigations has not been disclosed, but initial reports centered on spare parts accounting. Two former managers at <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, one of the subsidiaries, were sentenced to prison for tax fraud, and a <LOCATION> Pensacola </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, businessman was convicted of perjury last year in kickback schemes. They were accused of stealing more then $ 80,000 by billing <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> for materials never delivered. A third <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> employee was fired this year after new kickback allegations. The investigation has been marked by two unusual events. <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Howell </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Pensacola </LOCATION> graphic designer who did contract work for <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION>, disappeared a day before he was to testify before the <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> grand jury last December. Then in April, Gulf Power Senior Vice President <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON> <PERSON> Horton </PERSON> died in a <LOCATION> Pensacola </LOCATION> plane crash while he was on his way to <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, apparently to talk with corporate officials about the investigations. In addition to <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION>, other Southern subsidiaries are <ORGANIZATION> Alabama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Mississippi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Electronics Firm Reports Second-Quarter Loss</HEAD>
<DATELINE>GLENVIEW, Ill. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Despite reporting a second-quarter loss of $ 13 million, <ORGANIZATION> Zenith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electronics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> expects to report a profit for the year, <ORGANIZATION> Zenith </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pearlman </PERSON> says. The company announced Friday that shifts in the value of the dollar and increased interest expenses caused the second-quarter loss. `` Because of our currency position and other factors, we are now less confident that the company will be more profitable in 1989 than in 1988, especially if the dollar stays strong,'' <PERSON> Pearlman </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Zenith </ORGANIZATION>, the lone domestic television manufacturer and a major maker of personal computers, said the second-quarter loss amounted to 49 cents per share, compared with a loss of $ 12.1 million, or 46 cents per share, in the second quarter of 1988. Second-quarter sales totaled $ 676 million, up 15 percent from sales of $ 589 million in the 1988 period. For the first six months of 1989, <ORGANIZATION> Zenith </ORGANIZATION> reported a net loss of $ 17 million, or 64 cents per share, compared with a 1988 first-half loss of $ 11.7 million, or 45 cents per share. Sales in the first half totaled $ 1.35 billion, up 16 percent from $ 1.16 billion in the 1988 period. <PERSON> Pearlman </PERSON> said that this year, <ORGANIZATION> Zenith </ORGANIZATION> positioned itself in anticipation of a weakening <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar. Instead, the dollar's value increased, making the company unable to benefit from the stronger dollar for purchases made in foreign currencies `` Our currency positioning, which did n't permit us to operate at prevailing currency market rates, resulted in a lost profit opportunity of about $ 5 million in the second quarter,'' he said. `` And if exchange rates remain where they are today, the second-half effect could be about $ 20 million.'' Company officials said revenus from computer sales increased 12 percent in the second quarter to $ 384 million from $ 342 million in 1988. The increase came despite a reduction in personal-computer prices to meet price reductions by competitors. The company also reported an 18 percent increase in second-quarter consumer electronics revenue to $ 292 million from $ 247 million last year, reflecting higher color television and video recorder sales.
