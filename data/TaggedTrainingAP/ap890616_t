 The Army on Friday released the names of the three <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soldiers killed when the military helicopter they were flying crashed in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. Two men were identified by the Pentagon: Warrant Officer <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Madrid </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Bessemer </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION> and Chief Warrant Officer <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cornick </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruz </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>. At Ford Ord, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION> officials identified the third man as Staff Sgt <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> McDaniel </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>. The two officers were members of the 123rd Aviation Battalion of the 7th Infantry Division based at <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ord </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> McDaniel </PERSON> was a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Combat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Detachment </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Meade </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, officials said. An investigation into the cause of the crash was under way, said a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman, Maj. <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>. The cause of the crash appeared to be a mechanical failure, she said, and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials earlier had ruled out the possibility that the helicopter was fired upon. The helicopter, an OH-58 small observation craft, crashed near the Trans-Isthmian Highway as it was flying a mission for a military convoy traveling from <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clayton </LOCATION>, on the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> side of the Canal, to <PERSON> Fort </PERSON> <PERSON> Sherman </PERSON>, on the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION>.

 Brushing aside a homelessness protest, storms and a last-minute legal scare, officials Thursday opened Underground <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, a $ 142 million attempt to transform the business district into <LOCATION> Fun </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>. Wind and rain forced the opening ceremony to be moved to a covered section of the complex and prevented a fireworks display. But people crammed shoulder-to-shoulder to get a first-day look at the more than 100 shops, restaurants, nightclubs and street vendors. Police estimated that about 200,000 people visited through the day. Mayor <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>'s speech capping the opening ceremony was drowned out by demonstrators blowing whistles and chanting, `` <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> keeps the homeless underground.'' Six people were arrested and charged with criminal trespassing, police said. About an hour before the complex opened, <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Isaac </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenrette </PERSON> refused to stop the developers from using the Underground <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> name. He ruled that a company that claims it holds rights to the name filed a lawsuit too late. Underground <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> adds entertainment and nightlife to a downtown that had lost most of its fun spots to the suburbs. First-day visitors appeared to be enjoying themselves, and many said they'd be coming back. `` The shops are fantastic. I've done my Christmas shopping already,'' said <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> <PERSON> Brewer </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tuscon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, who was in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> to visit a friend. But even the most enthusiastic merchants acknowledged success is uncertain. An original Underground <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, located beneath downtown street viaducts, opened in 1969. Hurt by nearby subway construction and the perception that it was crime-ridden, it closed in 1982. Young made reviving Underground a priority of his administration, and with a combination of private investment, millions of dollars of municipal funds and the issuance of $ 85 million in revenue bonds, the project thrived. Developed over three years by <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION>, the new Underground is located on and around the old site. Advocates for the homeless say many of the city's street people were displaced by the Underground construction, and that public money used for the complex could have gone to providing affordable housing. When Young was drowned out by the demonstrators, he angrily defended his administration's actions on behalf of the poor. Dignitaries on the stand, including Gov. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, rose to applaud the mayor but the protesters shouted even louder. Young, a liberal Democrat who was prominent in the civil rights movement, said later he was not angry with the hecklers but insisted he did n't deserve their ire. `` You protest when you ca n't get people to take you seriously or talk with you,'' <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said. `` I meet with the homeless, we have a homeless task force, we put all of the resources we possibly can in dealing with the problems of homelessness. `` Maybe this helps in the sense that it puts homelessness on the national media,'' he added. `` But you're not going to be able to resolve the problems of homelessness unless we keep successful projects like this going that create jobs.'' <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, a partner at the Open Door Community, an organization that aids the homeless, said of the demonstration, `` I think it's a hard thing for a lot of people to understand _ why disrupt a good time? But there are a lot of people in this city who never have a good time because the basics of life are denied to them.'' Ms. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said that if Underground <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> provides jobs to the poor, they are likely to be paid the minimum wage, which she said is not enough money to live on.

 In a startling first for the largest winemaker in the world, the E. & amp; <ORGANIZATION> J. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gallo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Winery </ORGANIZATION> said it will stop for six months the sale of its its two brands of cheap high-alcohol wine in the seedy Tenderloin district. The action came Wednesday after Tenderloin-area distributor Gallo-Bay Cities, a Gallo-owned business, met with `` Safe and Sober Streets'' activists, who have protested the sale of the fortified wines in their district. `` If what we have done in this neighborhood improves the alcoholism problem in this area, we'll do the same thing in other neighborhoods,'' said <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Solomon </PERSON>, a spokesman for the Modesto-based winery. The protesters denounced fortified wines like <PERSON> Gallo </PERSON>'s Thunderbird and Night Train Express, and <ORGANIZATION> Canandaigua </ORGANIZATION>'s Wild Irish Rose. They said they were unable to walk through the Tenderloin without tripping over or being menaced by a wino. <PERSON> Gallo </PERSON> has never removed a product from the shelves, <PERSON> Solomon </PERSON> said. The privately held company has $ 1 billion in annual sales and 28 percent of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wine market. Sober Streets group went from grocery-to-grocery, trying to persuade the proprietors to take the cheap goods off their shelves. One grocer agreed but changed his mind, he said, after losing $ 850 in wine sales in a single day. <PERSON> Solomon </PERSON> characterized the action as an experiment by <PERSON> Gallo </PERSON> to see whether or not `` our beliefs and the evidence are correct'' _ that winos deprived of their cheap wine will turn to other alcohols. The wines involved are typically made from the cheapest vinous ingredients and the merest hint of grape flavor, then hyped with grape brandy to bring the alcohol to about 18 percent by volume. They sell for around 90 cents to $ 1.25 a bottle. It's estimated that the two wines account for less than 3 percent of company sales.

 An judge changed his mind about not paying a 12-member jury, which he dismissed without pay for ignoring his instructions in a personal injury case. <LOCATION> Allegheny </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Common Pleas Judge <PERSON> Silvestri </PERSON> <PERSON> Silvestri </PERSON> on Thursday authorized payments to the panel for five days of work after meeting with judges <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Zavarella </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Cappy </PERSON>, who administer the civil division. `` It was his order and he reconsidered it,'' <PERSON> Zavarella </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Silvestri </PERSON> refused to comment on why he changed his mind. `` With all the publicity on the case, I think Judge <PERSON> Silvestri </PERSON> just wants the matter to end,'' <PERSON> Zavarella </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Homosexual Congregation Breaks Ground by Joining Mainline Church</HEAD>

 Though churches have condemned homosexual activity for centuries, gay men and women are beginning to find a home within a mainline Christian denomination. The Spirit of the <ORGANIZATION> Lakes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ecumenical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> became the nation's first openly homosexual congregation to join a mainline church when it was accepted into membership of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christ </ORGANIZATION> in April, according to its leader. `` As far as we know, we're making history,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Geslin </PERSON>, pastor of Spirit of the Lakes. `` We see ourselves as a prophetic voice. `` We hope that we're breaking ground and leading the way for other churches and other denominations to open up and recognize gay and lesbian people's rightful place in the church.'' Spirit of the Lakes has grown from 18 people meeting in a living room in May 1987 to 150 members. It was voted into membership by more than 80 percent of the delegates attending the annual meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, the largest of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christ </ORGANIZATION>'s three associations in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> with 71 churches and 24,000 members. Spirit of the Lakes is considered a `` developing'' church while the association reviews the group's constitution and development plan. Those are likely to be approved at the association's 1990 annual meeting, formalizing the congregation's admission, association officials say. <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Loliger </PERSON>, co-coordinator of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lesbian-Gay </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Concerns </ORGANIZATION>, an <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION>, Ohio-based special-interest group within the church, said the acceptance of Spirit of the Lakes is a first for mainline denominations. `` This one is certainly very different than anything we have encountered before,'' he said. `` It is an openly gay and lesbian congregation, and they have sought to become a church with that right up front.'' Most Christian churches accept homosexuals as members, equally beloved by <PERSON> God </PERSON> as others, but condemn the practice of homosexuality. But the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christ </ORGANIZATION>, a 1.8-million-member Protestant church formed in 1957 when the <ORGANIZATION> Evangelical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reformed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> merged with the <ORGANIZATION> Congregational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Churches </ORGANIZATION>, often has been at the forefront of progressive social movements. In 1969, the church's general synod approved its first resolution supporting civil rights for homosexuals, and three years later it became the first mainline denomination to ordain an openly gay minister. In 1983, the general synod passed a resolution stating that `` a person's sexual orientation is not a moral issue'' and that sexual orientation should not be the basis for discrimination within the church. The synod encouraged <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christ </ORGANIZATION> churches to openly accept homosexuals as members. That inclusiveness is what attracted Spirit of the Lakes to the denomination. <PERSON> Geslin </PERSON>, 39, who grew up in <LOCATION> Anoka </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> suburb, received a master of divinity degree from the <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Religion </ORGANIZATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christ-affiliated </ORGANIZATION> school in <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>. He took over as pastor of Spirit of the Lakes in September and immediately began pursuing membership in the denomination. `` The discussion was, ` Why bother to affiliate at all?' Most -LRB- homosexuals -RRB- look at established churches as oppressive institutions,'' <PERSON> Geslin </PERSON> said. But the membership was attracted by the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christ </ORGANIZATION>'s structure, which allows autonomy for each congregation `` This is the best of both worlds for us,'' he said. `` We can remain an autonomous congregation ... and still associate with a larger Christian body. That allows us to be a community of gay-lesbian Christians and at the same time not be ghetto-ized.'' He described the congregation as college-educated professionals who come from <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION>, Lutheran and Episcopal backgrounds and are interested in social justice, peace, liberation and feminist theology. Although Spirit of the Lakes has generally met with quiet acceptance, some have voiced reservations. `` I do not think that any congregation should come in with a sexual or a racial orientation,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> McCutcheon </PERSON>, senior minister of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christ-affiliated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wayzata </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>. `` I would be bothered if somebody proposed a church just for men, or a church just for women, or a church just for married couples, and so on.'' <PERSON> Geslin </PERSON> says 10 percent of his church's membership is heterosexual. Spirit of the Lakes also is bucking Christian tradition which holds that the practice of homosexuality is a sin. People who interpret the Bible literally point to several Old and New Testament passages that appear to condemn homosexuality. One is <LOCATION> Leviticus </LOCATION> 20:13, which according to the Revised Standard Version says, `` If a man lies with a male as with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination.'' But <PERSON> Geslin </PERSON> and <PERSON> McCutcheon </PERSON> contend that the Bible must be interpreted in the context of the time in which it was written. When <PERSON> Leviticus </PERSON> was written, <PERSON> Geslin </PERSON> said, `` the Israelites were instinctively concerned with maximizing the probabilities of procreation. Religious laws governing sexual practices reinforced that basic tribal concern.'' <PERSON> Geslin </PERSON> criticizes people who use specific Bible verses to condemn homosexuals today. `` It's not taking the Bible as a whole,'' he said. `` It's picking out little bits and pieces to justify cultural prejudices.''

 A `` time tunnel'' is the visual and philosophical centerpiece of the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Opera </LOCATION>'s Ring cycle at the <ORGANIZATION> Kennedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Performing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION>. The concept creates a thrilling sensation that everything happening on stage in the present is part of the past and part of the future. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON>'s stunning creation, `` Der Ring des <PERSON> Nibelungen </PERSON>'' -LRB- `` The Ring of the Nibelungen'' _ dwarfs who owned a magic ring and a horde of gold -RRB-, is being performed the way the German composer intended it to be _ a four-day cycle. The Metropolitan Opera performed the entire epic about love and greed and gods and goddesses in April and May. It was the first time it had been presented in so short a span in 90 years. The Kennedy Center ring opened June 2. In all four of <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>'s Ring operas, `` Das Rheingold,'' `` Die Walkure,'' `` Siegfried'' and `` Gotterdammerung,'' the audience looks into the end of a tunnel designed by <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Sykora </PERSON>. The other end is straight ahead, far away and smaller, with a light beyond. This does n't mean that singers just stride around inside an otherwise hollow tunnel. Sometimes there are sufficient backdrops, scenery and props so that only two pieces of the 90-foot-high stucture's mouth are visible, curving across the top of the stage on both sides. The Kennedy Center's Ring is intensely theatrical. Characters move a lot; laser light flashes; fire juts up from grates in some dozen dark circles on the stage; fog pours from 20 fog machines; the flamboyantly feathered forest bird glides in on a swing instead of being an unseen voice. <PERSON> Gotz </PERSON> <PERSON> Friedrich </PERSON> staged the Ring for the company he has headed since 1981. The Ring, he said, concerns power, money and love. Its characters, and its viewers try to find solutions and a better way for the next generation. `` But they do the same errors again,'' he said. After <PERSON> Alberich </PERSON> steals the gold from the <ORGANIZATION> Rhinemaidens </ORGANIZATION> and sets the Nibelungs, now his slaves, to mine more gold, his office slides onstage _ six TV sets for overseeing the work, computers behind him, an electronic console in front of him. The mythic story, in which <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON> thought human truth could be found, begins with <PERSON> Alberich </PERSON>, a dwarf who yearns for love, invading the territory of the Rheinmaidens who lead him on and then spurn him, making him so angry he renounces love and steals their gold. It ends with the death of the superhero <PERSON> Siegfried </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Brunnhilde </LOCATION>'s throwing herself on his funeral pyre, her love redeeming the world In between is plenty of theft, betrayal and murder. Ring lovers are divided over how their beloved opera should be staged. Some prefer the naturalistic setting with the <ORGANIZATION> Valkyries </ORGANIZATION>' rock looking like a mountain top, as used by the Metropolitan and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> operas, rather than Ring cycles staged according to a director's concept Since <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON>'s grandson staged an abstract Ring in 1965, directorial `` interpretations'' have been the norm in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Friedrich </PERSON>, general director of the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Opera </LOCATION>, and set designer <PERSON> Sykora </PERSON> created this Ring in 1986. Its Kennedy Center performances commemorate the 40th anniversary of the Federal Republic of <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. `` When the Ring was first completed and performed in <LOCATION> Bayreuth </LOCATION> in 1876, <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON> said in the next year he would change everything,'' <PERSON> Friedrich </PERSON> said in an interview. `` He saw ... that what he wrote in his score about the scenes was bad. But in his lifetime, it never came to a new production. The tradition carried almost 80 years.'' The <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> production was moving, as the Ring visually flowed like the silk cloth it lavishly used among present, past and future. The curved rafters in the tunnel looked like staves in a huge winecask in a Bruegel painting, but the entrances into the wings from the tunnel were metal, like submarine hatches. The armored dragon slain by <PERSON> Siegfried </PERSON> moves forward like a tank, with a searchlight between glowing red eyes. After it is pierced by <PERSON> Siegfried </PERSON>'s sword, it collapses onto one wheel. With love so important in the Ring, <PERSON> Friedrich </PERSON> has added a bit of love interest not in the original text involving a giant and the goddess Freia. <PERSON> Friedrich </PERSON> also has Vietnam War images in the Ring, starting with the second opera, `` Die Walkure.'' Weapons, ancient and modern, khaki and camouflage cloth abound. In `` Siegfried,'' the third opera, the Wanderer dresses like a <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> War correspondent in long trench coat. <PERSON> Siegfried </PERSON> wears bib overalls to convey innocence, even after he weds <LOCATION> Brunnhilde </LOCATION>. It's only when he meets <PERSON> Gunther </PERSON>, king of the Gibichungs, who is dressed like a Marine officer, and his sophisticated sister that <PERSON> Siegfried </PERSON> changes to slacks and blazer. Trap doors are n't used in this production. When <PERSON> Erda </PERSON> comes up from inside the earth, she sits up out of a silk cloth which covers the stage. Four silk cloths are lifted and lowered by wires to make the waves in `` Das Rheingold.'' <LOCATION> Valhalla </LOCATION> is n't prominent either. When the gods first see it, it is small and distant. When it is destroyed at the end of the Ring, a few fragments fall from the ceiling. The Ring's ending usually is taken to mean that the status quo _ gods in the sky, giants and heroes on earth and Nibelungs, who are miners and blacksmiths, below the earth _ is destroyed and will be replaced by a better system. <PERSON> Friedrich </PERSON>'s idea is that history will repeat itself. The last image in `` Gotterdammerung'' is the same as the beginning of `` Das Rheingold'' _ people covered with a huge white silk cloth. Some details were n't immediately understandable, as having Loge, god of fire, dressed like a Wild West gambler, the earth goddess swimming offstage and the Gibichung king in whiteface. Musically, the <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Opera Orchestra is n't as flexible, balanced or strong as the Metropolitan Opera Orchestra. It is good but often does n't rise to the high points and sometimes sounds tired. <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez-Cobos </PERSON>, the company's music director, conducted the first Ring and <PERSON> Christof </PERSON> <PERSON> Perick </PERSON> conducted the second. Great Wagnerian voices are nearly as scarce as heros such as <PERSON> Siegfried </PERSON>. This production is blessed with <PERSON> Gunter </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Kannen </PERSON>, who sang <PERSON> Alberich </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Matti </PERSON> <PERSON> Salminen </PERSON>, who sang <PERSON> Hagen </PERSON> in both cycles and, in the second cycle, also sang one of the giants in `` Das Rheingold'' and <PERSON> Sieglinde </PERSON>'s husband in `` Die Walkure.'' <PERSON> Rene </PERSON> <PERSON> Kollo </PERSON>, probably the world's current best <PERSON> Siegfried </PERSON>, sang with beauty and without strain. <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> <PERSON> Estes </PERSON> showcased his rich voice as <PERSON> Wotan </PERSON> in the second cycle.

 As soon as a stone landed near his car, patrol leader <PERSON> Meishe </PERSON> <PERSON> Mishkan </PERSON> hit the brakes, popped a clip of 25-rounds into his Uzi submachine gun and led other Jewish settlers on a chase of a dozen Arab teen-agers. Moments later, a short, chubby settler with a white, knitted skullcap was stoned from a rooftop. `` I'm under attack,'' he yelled, crouching low, pivoting on one foot and raking a nearby rooftop with bullets. No one was hurt in Wednesday's clash. But the controversial settler patrols of the occupied lands have spurred accusations the settlers are taking too much of the law into their own hands. The organizer of the Wednesday patrol, <PERSON> Bella </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonen </PERSON>, said the settlers began the patrols in April after losing faith in the Israeli army's ability to end the 18-month Palestinian uprising against Israeli rule. `` The army is becoming more like a group of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> observers,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Gonen </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kiryat </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arba </LOCATION>, a settlement of 4,700 Jews that overlooks <LOCATION> Hebron </LOCATION>, a city with 50,000 Arabs. `` They do n't protect the Jews, all they do is separate the two sides. Army officials have ordered the settlers to end their patrols in Palestinian areas. `` It's illegal and each time the army comes across such a patrol it's dispersed immediately,'' a spokesman said. Israeli civilians, most often settlers, were involved in the shooting deaths of 19 of the 516 Palestinians killed since the uprising began. Twenty-two Israelis also have died, including six settlers. <PERSON> Gonen </PERSON> said <PERSON> Kiryat </PERSON> <PERSON> Arba </PERSON> settlers began car patrols this week, which they officially refer to as `` archaeological expeditions'' to circumvent official objections. Wednesday's patrol slowly cruised through the winding streets of <LOCATION> Hebron </LOCATION> for about a half-hour until the stone landed near <LOCATION> Mishkan </LOCATION>'s car outside the <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> campus During the clash, <PERSON> Yaakov </PERSON> <PERSON> Ben-David </PERSON>, a tall, thin man in his 20s who is a Moslem convert to <LOCATION> Judiasm </LOCATION>, carefully took aim before letting loose with a burst of three rounds. `` They're rounding the stone wall,'' he shouted as he charged up a hill. Other settlers stood behind him, firing their Uzis at the Palestinians who were running up the hill, behind a wall. Sharp pops could be heard as the bullets ricocheted off the stones. The encounter lasted about three minutes, after which the settlers withdrew to their cars and the Arab teens stood on a stone wall beyond gunfire range, chanting Palestinian slogans and flashing `` V'' for victory signs. `` The problem here is the media. If we chase them and run into their homes, the press will go crazy and attack us. We ca n't do anything here,'' said settler <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> as he climbed into his mud-spattered blue car and rolled up the reinforced glass windows. `` We are not shooting to kill, but if we hit one, well ...'' said the driver, <PERSON> Gilon </PERSON> <PERSON> Ben-Said </PERSON>, shrugging his shoulders. As he drove away, <PERSON> Ben-Said </PERSON> broke into a chorus of the song, `` Am <PERSON> Yisrael </PERSON> <PERSON> Hai </PERSON>'' _ `` The Nation of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> Lives.'' Army troops arrived as the settler convoy pulled out, firing tear gas between the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> and the departing settlers. Ten minutes later, the group pulled up to the grave of the biblical prophet <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON> in the nearby <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> town of <LOCATION> Halhoul </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Zvi </PERSON> <PERSON> Katzover </PERSON>, deputy chairman of <PERSON> Kiryat </PERSON> <PERSON> Arba </PERSON>'s town council, chastised his men for firing so freely and warned them to hold their fire if there was another confrontation. `` If we start shooting and other people are chasing, someone could end up with a bullet in his back,'' he said. As <PERSON> Katzover </PERSON> finished speaking, two jeeploads of soldiers pulled up. The commanding officer, a major, demanded the settlers leave the area. A jeep with paramilitary border police escorted the settlers to the gates of <LOCATION> Kiryat </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arba </LOCATION>. Later, settlers held a town meeting with a local army commander, Col. <PERSON> Baruch </PERSON>. Under military regulations, his last name may not be revealed. The meeting was scheduled following several incidents of vigilante raids on Arab villages in reprisal for stone-throwing and confrontations with troops in which one officer was beaten. A tall, husky man wearing a bush hat and a pistol holster with extra clips of ammunition attached to its side stood up and said: `` I support a family of 10. What am I suppose to do if I am attacked, call the army and wait?'' Col. <PERSON> Baruch </PERSON>, who patiently jotted down each settler's question during a half-hour session, responded in a slow, controlled voice: `` No one can promise you that there will be no stones thrown in <LOCATION> Judea </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Samaria </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. -RRB-'' `` But in no instance can people take the law into their own hands. The best way for us to act is for people to let the army do its job,'' he said.

 Chinese students abroad are trying to extend their stays in their host countries because of the crisis in their homeland, which has turned thousands of exchange students into potential exiles. The Chinese government's violent suppression of a student-led reform movement has sent a shiver around the world, instilling fear in some students who had hoped to return home and hope in others who want to stay abroad. Since the June 3-4 military attack on unarmed students in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, governments have said they would extend the visas of Chinese students. Among those are the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and the 12-nation <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>. In <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said it had received 10,000 inquiries from <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> students _ virtually all of the 10,600 registered in the country _ about extending their visas. Only a few have actually applied, said immigration spokeswoman <PERSON> Jenny </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoskin </PERSON>. `` But we expect a great deal more in coming weeks.'' `` We would consider sympathetically the case of any student who could be considered in any sense in danger by returning to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>,'' Prime Minister <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawke </PERSON> said Thursday, assuring students in <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> they need not worry about their visas lapsing and being deported. In <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, statistics show about 80,000 Chinese now are studying abroad, with half of them in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, according to the Returned Student Association. They were permitted to leave <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> only after passing competitive examinations. Rules published in 1987 said they had to show they `` love the motherland and cherish socialism.'' Political reliability and family connections _ relatives in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> to ensure their return _ are important. Abroad, many students hope to keep alive the pro-democracy movement. But distance from the tensions in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has not allayed fears of government reprisals. In several countries, students say they believe they are being monitored and harassed by <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> authorities. At <ORGANIZATION> Brandeis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> near <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, mathematician <PERSON> Cheng </PERSON> <PERSON> Mo </PERSON>, 26, said he suspected the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> government was responsible for taking down posters after a meeting of Chinese students. In <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> student who asked not to be identified said diplomats had photographed demonstrations outside the Chinese Embassy in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. `` Although they could n't possibly identify everyone, many of us are worrying,'' he said. Another student in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, also asking anonymity, said pro-democracy activists have toned down the optimism they felt two weeks ago. `` It looks like the battle will be a long one,'' he said. `` None of us wants to do anything conspicuous. But we will continue to fight. Maybe publish a magazine or something. We wo n't make any needless sacrifices.'' Some Chinese even want to move to <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, where the mainland's old rulers fled after the communist revolution <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s de facto embassy in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> said 200 Chinese students had picked up applications for Taiwanese passports and 20 had submitted them in the last four days. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, which represents the <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> government in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, has received several dozen applications for citizenship `` and we expect more to come,'' said spokesman <PERSON> Kate </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanniker </PERSON>. The Taiwanese government announced last week it would relax its rules and issue <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> passports to Chinese students who had pariticipated in rallies in other countries supporting the demonstrators in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. `` This is to show our concern for overseas mainland students. We hope our passports will help them complete their studies in foreign countries,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Chen </PERSON> <PERSON> Yu-chu </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Taipei </LOCATION>. But holding a <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> passport will not guarantee permanent residence in Nationalist <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, he said, because the country's laws say mainland Chinese must live four years in a free country to be eligible for entrance and residence on the island. The <ORGANIZATION> Taiwanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> has proposed offering financial help to mainland Chinese studying in other countries. Some of the 3,000 Chinese students in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> have expressed worry that their financing ends this summer, said Dr. <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Lue </PERSON>, assistant principal of <ORGANIZATION> Kings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. `` And so they are worried that if the situation in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> prevails and it's hazardous for them to return, then they're going to find it difficult to find funding and to stay on here longer,'' he told the <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION>. Some Chinese students in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> fear they will be jailed if they return home, said <PERSON> Ding </PERSON> <PERSON> Xueliang </PERSON>, 36, a <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> student who was active in the democracy movement in exile. `` We'll continue to speak out,'' <PERSON> Ding </PERSON> said. `` It could cause more trouble, but our moral obligation is to help our friends in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>.'' In <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>, seven Chinese students and two businessmen have applied for asylum since the crackdown in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Inge </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomsen </PERSON>, a department head in the Aliens Directorate. She said <LOCATION> Danish </LOCATION> authorities would be cautious in forcing any Chinese to return to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> under the present circumstances.

<HEAD>Black Elected Officials in Alabama Accuse Federal Agents of Harassment</HEAD>

 Stung by a series of corruption allegations, black leaders across <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> are accusing federal authorities of racial harassment, but one <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney says he and his colleagues are `` equal-opportunity prosecutors.'' <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Arrington </PERSON>, a former college professor serving his third term as <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION>'s first black mayor, said federal agents tried to frame him through a developer who faces tax bribery charges, and other black officials say their phones have been tapped or they have been the target of unjustified investigations. At <PERSON> Arrington </PERSON>'s request, a special state prosecutor has been named to review the actions of the federal agents, and the federal government's own office that investigates bias allegations against law enforcement authorities is looking into the matter. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> staff is also reviewing the allegations. Blacks in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> began flexing ballot box strength after passage of the 1965 Voting Rights Act, and now hold more than 1,000 elective offices in the state, including 24 of the 141 seats in the <ORGANIZATION> Alabama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION>. Three black legislators from the <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION> area are under indictment on federal charges they tried to bribe a former legislator, who is white, in connection with a proposed dog track. Their attorneys contend race bias was a factor that led to their indictment. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON>, the state <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION> president, was convicted of federal bribery charges in September and stripped of his seat in the state <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>. He was accused of accepting $ 10,000 to use his influence to get early parole for a convicted killer. <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> contends his prosecution was spurred by his high profile opposition to the flying of the Confederate flag atop the Capitol. Those cases, and reports of <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> surveillance of other blacks, amount to selective harassment, according to <PERSON> Arrington </PERSON> and others. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>, a black attorney who is a veteran of the civil rights movement, said the actions are part of a pattern that began with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s arrival at the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> eight years ago and continues under President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` All of this is a conspiracy on the part of the administration to destroy <PERSON> black </PERSON> leadership and black political power,'' <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> said. State Sen. <PERSON> Hank </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON>, a Democrat, claims that more than half the black elected officials in the state are under investigation or surveillance. But <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> of <PERSON> Montgomery </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is colorblind. `` We're equal-opportunity prosecutors,'' he said. `` We'll prosecute any crook in the district, any time. At <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Donaldson </PERSON> said the harassment accusations were too absurd to deserve comment. As for <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON>' claim that half of the black officials are targets of some kind of investigation, `` It does n't ring true to me,'' said <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Shockley </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. At <PERSON> Arrington </PERSON>'s request, state Attorney General <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Siegelman </PERSON> named a special prosecutor to investigate actions of the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Arrington </PERSON> said he wanted a determination of whether agents `` engaged in criminal solicitation, conspiracy, attempted bribery and-or obstruction'' of <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION>'s government. Sen. <PERSON> Howell </PERSON> <PERSON> Heflin </PERSON>, D-Ala., a member of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said Wednesday that the panel's staff is making a preliminary investigation and a decision will be made later on whether to refer the matter to the full committee The assistant counsel for the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Professional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Responsibility </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Bobzien </PERSON>, said he and an investigator will visit <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION> next week to conduct interviews in response to a request by <PERSON> Arrington </PERSON>'s attorney. <PERSON> Bobzien </PERSON>'s office was created in 1975 to look into complaints about employees of the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and other investigative agencies. It was disclosed this week that <PERSON> Arrington </PERSON> has been a subject of <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> scrutiny at various times dating back to 1972 when he was a city councilman supporting blacks alleging police brutality. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> investigated <PERSON> Arrington </PERSON> for possible bribery and financial conflicts of interest involving his business partners but no charges have been filed. The mayor was interviewed by the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> in 1985. A report Thursday in the <ORGANIZATION> Birmingham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post-Herald </ORGANIZATION> also said that a new series of court-sanctioned <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> wiretaps has been used to monitor the telephone conversations of at least two members of the <LOCATION> Jefferson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> legislative delegation, Reps. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> and <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> wiretaps were used last year in the investigation that led to the indictments in the dog track case. <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> declined to comment on the latest wiretaps. `` I have been operating on the assumption that the phone was tapped,'' <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> said. `` I resent the investigation. I have n't done anything.'' <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Polson </PERSON>, a lawyer representing Ms. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, said he did not have `` the foggiest idea'' why her phone was tapped but says it is `` more than a coincidence that it is the black politicians who are catching all the heat.''

 A half dozen 8-year-olds sat on the floor of a makeshift classroom in this <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> village and leafed through a science book on animals. Some drew Palestinian flags in the margins, but none could read the simple text. `` If they were in school, they'd be able to read by now,'' said <PERSON> Najah </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahmoud </PERSON>, the children's 15-year-old teacher. `` I'm trying to get them to memorize some words, but it just is n't enough.'' Illiteracy is growing among the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>'s 230,000 elementary school children, who have been deprived of an education for 16 months as a result of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s closure of schools. Classrooms have remained empty for all but a few weeks since Feb. 3, 1988. <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> authorities say they closed the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>'s 1,194 schools, including 145 kindergartens, because they were breeding grounds for violent protests during the 18-month Palestinian uprising. Fifteen schools in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> also have been closed, but the army has not shut down the entire system. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has come under increasing international pressure, including a call from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, to end what many consider a collective punishment and to reopen classes when the closure order comes up for renewal on Monday. `` We would like to see the schools open but without an escalation of violence and without an increase in danger that children would be injured in the process. That's our concern, and Mr. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>'s concern, as well,'' Foreign Minister <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> said in an interview. To try to keep students from falling too far behind, Palestinians have been running underground classes in more than 100 <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> towns and villages in defiance of army orders outlawing such alternative education. The lessons are taught in unused buildings, mosques, churches or even in the open air, shaded by a tree. But, according to <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> educators, these so-called `` people's schools'' have produced mixed results. `` The problem we face now is illiteracy,'' said <PERSON> Khalil </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahshi </PERSON>, principal of the Quaker-run <ORGANIZATION> Friends </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION>. `` Instead of consolidating reading skills at ages 7 to 9, we are dealing with children as old as 9 years old who are illiterate.'' <PERSON> Malashi </PERSON> said some children from poorer families, who have taken on unskilled jobs to supplement meager family incomes, may become permanent dropouts. And wealthy Palestinians, concerned about the educational prospects for their children, are leaving for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. `` Long term, the community is going to pay a price at the level of development, production and skilled manpower. This is the biggest asset of any society,'' he said. The second-graders studying in a cramped one-room stone house in <PERSON> Kafr </PERSON> <PERSON> Ein </PERSON>, a village of 1,000 about 25 miles north of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, spent a recent science class drawing pictures of donkeys, chickens and camels. <PERSON> Samir </PERSON>, a dark-eyed 7-year-old, carefully sketched two outlawed <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> flags onto the hump of his camel. `` I'd like to be able to read. It is important,'' he said in a small, serious voice. `` Instead, I can draw a Palestinian flag.'' Grades one through six in <PERSON> Kafr </PERSON> <PERSON> Ein </PERSON> study two hours each day, doubling up two classes at a time on opposite sides of the room. There are no classes for the upper grades, and the only teaching materials in evidence were two tattered primary-level science books, some colored markers and two chalkboards. But teaching materials were n't the only thing missing. The second-graders' 15-year-old teacher, <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahmoud </PERSON>, only in 9th grade herself, conceded she has no teaching qualifications. `` What I can give them is better than nothing, but it ca n't compare with what they'd be learning in school,'' she said Besides teaching basic Arabic and math to her fourth-grade class, instructor <PERSON> Manah </PERSON> <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON>, 20 teaches a new subject called `` national education'' ordered in April by uprising leaders linked to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. `` I teach them about the intefadeh and how not to be afraid of the soldiers when they come to the village,'' said <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Abbas </PERSON>, who wore an enamel necklace showing all Palestine, including <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, painted in the colors of the outlawed Palestinian flag.

 <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> has overturned a ban on <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Scorsese </PERSON>'s film, `` The Last Temptation of Christ,'' though the judges said the movie is likely to offend some people. The country's 27-member Theater and <ORGANIZATION> Film </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Censorship </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> banned the film last October. The panel cited a criminal law that forbids practices offensive to the beliefs of any religious group. The movie, adapted from a 1955 novel by <PERSON> Nikos </PERSON> <PERSON> Kazanthakis </PERSON>, touched off protests by <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> groups in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 A teen-ager charged in the firebombing death of a baby has become a focus of disputes about racial justice, the death penalty for juveniles and whether <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> is imposing its legal standards on <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> is expected to decide soon whether <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> can extradite the black 17-year-old, known in court documents only as O.M. because of his juvenile status. Prosecutors deny race has anything to do with the matter, and the baby's relatives and an <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION> official agree. `` It does n't make any difference to me what color somebody is, black, white or polka dot,'' said District Attorney <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hedgespeth </PERSON>. `` What a lot of folks are not saying is that the victim of this crime was black. There is no place on my docket for white or black. It does n't matter to me.'' O.M. was charged with murder and arson in the death of 14-month-old <PERSON> Tamel </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. The baby died in a kitchen blaze on the night of May 12, 1988, after a plastic jug of gasoline was tossed into his apartment at a housing project where a relative had been involved in a fight. The teen-ager's grandmother testified at a court hearing in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> that the white authorities in <LOCATION> Etowah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, a mostly rural area that includes the steel city of <LOCATION> Gadsden </LOCATION>, have a longstanding vendetta against her family. The youth's father and uncle died in police custody, she said. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> police captured the boy in December only after his grandmother, <PERSON> Alyce </PERSON> <PERSON> Guice </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, was jailed for 82 days last summer by an <LOCATION> Etowah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> judge for failing to produce the teen-ager in court. She said he disappeared the night of the fire, after police released him to her custody. The jailing set off small civil rights demonstrations in <LOCATION> Gadsden </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> passed legislation May 30 intended to block the teen-ager's return to <LOCATION> Gadsden </LOCATION> for 90 days. Council members said extradition would violate the district's ban on the death penalty, because if O.M. is convicted in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, he could face execution in the electric chair. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> has heard arguments but not yet ruled on a challenge to the death penalty for those who were minors when they committed crimes. The <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> boy was 16 at the time of <PERSON> Tamel </PERSON>'s death A <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> judge in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> ruled March 30 that O.M. should be returned to <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>. But the extradition was delayed until after his appeal, which could make the council's action moot. <PERSON> Hedgespeth </PERSON> would not say what he has decided about whether to seek the death penalty. `` They're fanning enough flames up there in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>,'' he said. `` I'm just sitting here keeping my mouth shut.'' He said county blacks who gave him 90 percent of their vote when he was elected `` asked two things of me _ that I prosecute black-on-black crime just like anybody else, and that I not systematically strike blacks from juries.'' He said that in his 2 -LCB- years in the office, he has followed both requests. Sol Reynolds, <PERSON> Tamel </PERSON>'s uncle, said race has nothing to do with the charges against the 17-year-old. `` If they want to talk about being mistreated, the baby was the one mistreated because he is dead and gone,'' <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Tamel </PERSON>'s grandmother, <PERSON> Emma </PERSON> <PERSON> Nell </PERSON> <PERSON> Rutledge </PERSON>, said she wants whoever killed the baby to get what they deserve. Three people, all black, have been charged with arson and murder. <PERSON> Yul </PERSON> <PERSON> Devoe </PERSON> <PERSON> Guice </PERSON>, 31, who is suspected of throwing the plastic jug of gasoline into the project apartment, is in the county jail. The other alleged accomplice has not been found. <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Gadsden </LOCATION> physician who heads the local chapter of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advancement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colored </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION>, said he believes O.M. would get as fair a trial at home as anywhere. `` It seems to me we all want to see justice dealt out,'' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said. `` I have n't gotten the opinion that we are any better or worse off than some of the other areas in the country.''

<TEXT>
 The teen-ager sat gingerly at the witness table and spoke so softly that the congressmen had trouble hearing her. But there was nothing gentle or innocent in the tale she told of children carrying guns to carry out the drug trade. `` You can get guns on the street just about as easily as you can get candy,'' <PERSON> Detra </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, whose last name was not revealed, told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Select </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Children </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Youth </ORGANIZATION> and Families on Thursday. `` Everyone knows how to get a gun if they want one. The guns range from .22 s to 9 millimeters to Uzis. Generally, she said, the youngsters get their guns from the drug traffickers for whom they work. `` If they hustle for a person _ he's a runner or a hit man _ he's getting a gun to carry out the orders the man has given him,'' said <PERSON> Detra </PERSON>, 18 The hearing on children and guns occurred one day after <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> asked state lawmakers for a law that would punish people who leave firearms within reach of children. Pediatrician <PERSON> Katherine </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Christoffel </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, representing the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pediatrics </ORGANIZATION>, painted a grim picture for the panel: `` Ten <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> children ages 18 and under are killed every day in handgun suicides, homicides and accidents,'' she said. `` Three or four times as many are wounded. One of every 25 admissions to American pediatric trauma centers is due to gunshot wounds. In 1987, gun injuries were the fourth-leading cause of unintentional-injury death for children ages 14 and under. For inner-city black adolescent boys and young men, firearm injuries are the leading cause of death.'' But <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Kleck </PERSON>, an associate professor of criminology at <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, said accidental shootings of innocent bystanders `` are extremely rare,'' that the involvement of guns in youth suicide has fallen since 1979, and that fatal gun accidents involving youths, as well as for all people, have been declining for 20 years. Nevertheless, <PERSON> Detra </PERSON> said she knows eight people who have been shot to death, and more who have been wounded. Of those killed, she said, `` Half had guns and were in a gunfight, and half of them were innocent bystanders.'' Drug-related killings have given <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> the nation's highest per capita murder rate. So far this year, 202 murders have been committed in the District, compared to 133 at this time last year. Most have been drug-related, police say. The lure of dramatic monetary rewards in the drug trade inspires youngsters to get involved even when they see friends killed, said <PERSON> Detra </PERSON>, who graduated from high school last year and now works for a local recreation program to keep young people off the streets. `` They get involved because they want fast money, to buy cars, jewelry and radios. They do n't get jobs because the pay is too low,'' she said. Youngsters `` look at the hustlers as role models,'' in part because they have money and in part because they `` are nice to the young children,'' she said. <PERSON> Detra </PERSON> said one way to curtail youthful involvement in the drug trade is to offer better jobs at better wages. She also said youngsters need alternative role models, `` other adults who are willing to talk and spend time'' with younger children. Meanwhile, she dismissed many ideas offered by lawmakers as ways to deter young people from getting access to guns. Holding parents liable for their children's use of weapons will fail because `` there's not too many youth today who talk to their parents,'' she said. `` It's not a family bond anymore'' and parents do n't have control over their drug-dealing children. Fear of arrest and a substantial prison term for carrying a firearm also wo n't deter those in the drug trade because they feel `` it's not going to happen to me,'' she said. The only thing that might change their minds is if authorities `` lock them up so they understand it's not so easy to carry a gun and get away with it. ... They're not going to believe it until they see it.'' Passing laws making it more difficult to buy guns legally also wo n't work, <PERSON> Detra </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> has one of the toughest gun control laws in the country, yet young people have no trouble obtaining them illegally, she said.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s four-day visit to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> was enveloped by good feelings and kind words that will be difficult to translate into personal political gain. Both the Soviet president and West German Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> face an array of domestic difficulties that can not be washed away by several days of friendly, high-profile meetings. Although <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s great popularity abroad adds to his prestige and the status of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, it has not touched fundamental problems that trouble millions of Soviets _ a continued lack of food and consumer goods, housing shortages and stifling bureaucracy. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> and his <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> party have suffered in state elections the past two years, losing control of major West German cities. The chancellor is accused of mishandling recent controversies, such as the disclosure of a West German role in an alleged Libyan chemical weapons plant and the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> furor over short-range nuclear weapons. The summit produced a historic joint declaration of goals for easing tensions in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and boosted trust and confidence between Soviets and West Germans. But it was devoted mostly to creating a positive atmosphere and skirted sensitive issues like the future of divided <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and differing approaches to disarmament. After years when their tottering leaders were an embarrassment, Soviets have become accustomed to seeing foreign crowds cheering their leader. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> remains popular at home, but many Soviets are beginning to question when and if his reform policies will improve living standards. While he was away, other Soviet officials were struggling with what has become a chronic problem _ an outbreak of violence between ethnic groups, this time in the Central Asian republic of <LOCATION> Uzbekistan </LOCATION>. Reasons for the unrest are not clear, but some blame an economic collapse caused by overcrowding and unemployment. In <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> continually stressed the theme of cooperation. If the two countries do cooperate more closely, it could help the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in two ways. A lessening of military tension would allow <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to turn more of its industrial potential to producing consumer goods. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has said he needs a lessening of international tension to devote more resources to the ailing economy. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> invited finance and industry leaders in <LOCATION> Cologne </LOCATION> to help convert Soviet defense industries. That offers another avenue to improving the Soviet economy _ increased investment by West German business. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> is the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s largest Western trading partner, and businessmen showed the Soviet leader a dazzling array of high technology. But <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> stressed that he did not come as a beggar. He emphasized cooperation, proposing to merge the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s abilities in basic scientific research with West German technology for the benefit of both sides <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s problems are of an entirely different nature, but no less threatening. His party currently polls less support than the leftist Social Democrats and risks losing national elections in December 1990. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s slide was arrested somewhat after the even higher-profile visit two weeks ago of President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, with whom he was photographed frequently during a summit that lasted less than two days. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> came to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> immediately after the <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> summit in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> on May 29-30, at which <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> were able to mend fences after a months-long dispute over negotiating with the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc to reduce short-range rockets. Having salvaged a compromise from a confrontation that threatened alliance unity, <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> was riding high during the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> visit. His three sessions with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> also likely boosted his prestige. <PERSON> Ralf </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuecks </PERSON>, a leader of the far-left <ORGANIZATION> Greens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, remarked after the summit that `` Chancellor <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> had tried to sun himself in <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s glow.'' The effects should be apparent this weekend. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>'s party is running candidates for top posts in Rhineland-Palatine and <LOCATION> Saarland </LOCATION> states Sunday as well as <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> elections.

 A two-state coal miners' wildcat strike escalated Thursday with roving pickets expanding their walkout to the northern <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> coal field, company officials said. `` I think what we're seeing is it's pretty much spreading,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Island </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Creek </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Noel </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION>'s southern <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> mines, employing about 190, have been shut down since Monday as striking workers ignore a federal judge's back-to-work order. On Thursday, the walkout spread to <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Grant </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> mines, employing 625, and its <LOCATION> Nicholas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> mines, where 250 miners work, <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said. All <ORGANIZATION> BethEnergy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> mines were shut down, idling about 600 workers in <LOCATION> Boone </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> and <PERSON> Barbour </PERSON> counties, said company president <PERSON> R.J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON> Estimates of the number of miners idled by the wildcat range up to 10,000. The walkout began Monday as a show of solidarity with 1,600 <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> members in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> on strike since April against The <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> members at <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> had been working for 14 months without a contract. In particular, workers are angry that the company dropped out of the union's national contract with the <ORGANIZATION> Bituminous </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Operators </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> in an attempt to wring favorable work-rule changes. Union officials have not returned phone calls this week, but they have said they did not authorize the walkouts, which violate a no-strike clause in the union's 1988 national contract with the <ORGANIZATION> BCOA </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> BCOA </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Quenon </PERSON> on Thursday called on <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> leadership to end the walkout, saying any hopes the strike will make other companies pressure <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> to settle on a contract are misguided. `` I would no more try to tell someone else how to run their company than I would expect someone else to try to tell me how to run my company,'' said <PERSON> Quenon </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Peabody </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holding </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's largest coal producer. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Rahall </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, called for <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beckley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mining </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, also the object of a <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> contract strike, to settle with the `` These companies are doing a grave disservice to those coal operators who negotiated in good faith and signed agreements with the <ORGANIZATION> UMWA </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Rahall </PERSON> said. `` By refusing to come to terms with their workers, these companies are creating an atmosphere in the coal fields which is not conducive to the type of stability and security of supply the purchasers of our coal have come to expect.'' <PERSON> Rahall </PERSON> also offered encouragement to three top union officials who have been jailed without bond in <LOCATION> Roanoke </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, for orchestrating picket-line civil disobedience in the <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> strike. `` And to those who have been jailed for no act of violence, but for exercising your constitutional rights, I say do not despair,'' <PERSON> Rahall </PERSON> said. The strike also spread Thursday to barge-loading operations along the <LOCATION> Kanawha </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> area. Several operators along the river reported that pickets manned entrances to their facilities. Some continued to move coal while others could not. <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> pickets appeared briefly at <ORGANIZATION> Amherst </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> near <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, where 17 <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steelworkers </ORGANIZATION> members failed to report to work, a spokesman said. About 18 pickets in front of <ORGANIZATION> Hatfield </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transfer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Marmet </LOCATION> kept a half-dozen employees from going to work, one employee said. Madison Coal and <ORGANIZATION> Supply </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> tied up three tugboats Thursday, idling 31 employees, said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Barr </PERSON>, manager of marine traffic. He said he expects more layoffs if the wildcats continue. `` This is going to put the whole state into an economic crisis,'' <PERSON> Barr </PERSON> said. The walkout has n't hurt <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>'s economy yet, but the pain threshhold could be near for some areas, state <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Twila </PERSON> <PERSON> Matheny </PERSON> said. `` When you're talking about your heavier coal producing counties, and 90 percent of their mines closed, we could be near that now,'' she said. Lawyers for seven coal companies filed damage lawsuits in federal court Wednesday naming the <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> and several locals in southern <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> as defendants. Several companies said they are suffering daily losses of as much as $ 97,000 because of the strike. There is `` a 100 percent chance'' of a sympathy strike in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> international executive board member <PERSON> Tommy </PERSON> <PERSON> Buchanan </PERSON>, whose District 20 includes most of the state. <PERSON> Buchanan </PERSON>, however, said but <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Trumka </PERSON> would make the final decision on any walkout. There are an estimated 6,500 miners in the state, most of them union members.

<TEXT>
 Skeptical Southern Baptists and Las Vegans sized each other up this week as the town some have dubbed <LOCATION> Sin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> played unlikely host to the passionate opponents of gambling and drinking. <PERSON> Stan </PERSON> <PERSON> Pritchett </PERSON>, a delegate to the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION>, and cabbie <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Capaldi </PERSON> termed the three-day event a draw _ with eyes opening on both sides of what has been called the meeting of the high rollers and the Holy Rollers. The gathering for the nation's largest <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> denomination ended Thursday. `` They're nice, decent people; they even gave me a Bible,'' said <PERSON> Capaldi </PERSON> as hundreds of Baptists passed out Bibles and imparted their faith to tourists and residents. `` I do n't think they can do much about our image, or our thinking.'' Down the neon-bathed thoroughfare known as the Strip, <PERSON> Pritchett </PERSON> approached tourists who hurried between casinos Wednesday to beat the 100-degree-plus heat. `` The people have been generally very friendly,'' said <PERSON> Pritchett </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Pensacola </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION> `` We thought people would look at us like a calf looks at a new gate. Generally the people have been very friendly. The atmosphere here is like almost any place, except for the gambling.'' <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Wakeman </PERSON>, pastor of the <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> in </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fallon </ORGANIZATION>, 380 miles to the northwest, said he takes exception to the image rap. `` I get a little upset with the people who came here from back East and are bad-mouthing <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Wakeman </PERSON> said. `` A lot of people thought they'd come here and find a lot of people gambling and drunk,'' said <PERSON> Annette </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, who tended one of the booths in the exhibit hall. `` That's just the impression people who live outside of here have But it was n't like that at all.'' `` I would think from all I've heard that the convention would look with favor on our returning to <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> in the future,'' said <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Shackleford </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION>'s vice president for public relations. `` I have heard nothing but good reports about the people of <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>.'' At the Stardust Hotel and Casino, spokesman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Seagrave </PERSON> said slot machine play for the hotel was down considerably for the week. Outside, on the Strip, one of the Baptists earlier this week approached <PERSON> Jeri </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, a tourist from <LOCATION> Escondido </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION> `` Have you met <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON>?'' the man asked. `` You mean, in person?'' she responded, surprised by the question. `` No, in your heart,'' he replied. `` Yes, I have, in my heart,'' Ms. <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> answered. He handed her a book titled `` Here's Hope _ <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> Cares for You.'' `` I guess it was a nice gesture,'' she said. The title of the book was emblazoned on billboards across <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> for weeks prior to the convention. Pages of the <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> phone book were distributed so that the 20,423 convention delegates and others could pray for the city's 700,000 residents Some 1,800 Baptists fanned out across the city last weekend, knocking on doors in a mission to save souls. They reported polite response. `` I think they're going to be surprised when they find we're just a normal city like any other city,'' Mayor <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Lurie </PERSON> had promised before the convention. Some members of a <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> advance team who have been here since January preparing for the convention said they'd found a different city than they expected. `` I really have been impressed with <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON>, a church volunteer. `` We've been in a lot of other cities that, to use a term, are more <LOCATION> Sin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> than <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> is.''

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has always been difficult to figure out. But as the repression in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> rolls on, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is n't much easier to read than the most inscrutable leaders who have guided the world's most populous nation. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> comes to his job with double training in <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> affairs. He headed the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> liaison office in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> and is a former director of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. His experience in these and other posts helped put him in the White House. Figuring out what goes on behind the bamboo curtain in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> is expected of the president based on his background and the data flowing to his desk from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomatic and intelligence sources. And yet, nearly two weeks after hundreds of pro-democracy students were gunned down in <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>, the president and Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> still seem to be waiting for the other shoe to drop. There is no indication they have an overall strategy for dealing with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> or that they have come to any conclusions about what to expect next. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, in two news conference, and <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, sporadically through his spokeswoman, <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON>, have chided top Chinese officials for suppressing dissent and otherwise violating international standards of human rights. The criticism has been mild. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> suspended military sales to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, taking the advice of Ambassador <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Lilley </PERSON>, urged Americans to leave the country. Those, too, were minimal actions. Undersecretary of State <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kimmitt </PERSON> on Wednesday called in Chinese Ambassador <PERSON> Han </PERSON> <PERSON> Xu </PERSON> to protest the ordered expulsion of reporters from The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> from <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> defended the journalists' right to report the news. That's not a difficult or very imaginative stand to take. But the administration did not retaliate by ordering the expulsion of any of the 25 Chinese journalists in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. There was no <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> tit-for-tat diplomacy, the usual response to expulsions of American diplomats or reporters. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, meanwhile, has been relatively feisty. On Wednesday, 67 senators, including both the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> and Democratic leadership, signed a letter to Prime Minister <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> urging him to release jailed Chinese student leaders. On Thursday, at a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> hearing, several lawmakers criticized the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> for what they said was a sluggish evacuation of Americans. Some said they helped constituents out of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> while the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> while still contemplating the situation. Many Americans businesses had ordered their workers to leave before the department made its move on Tuesday. Rep. <PERSON> Rod </PERSON> <PERSON> Chandler </PERSON>, R-Wash., said `` In a crisis in which the lives of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens are in danger, I believe protection of Americans must be the highest priority. Clearly this was not the case in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> this month.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> set the tone for his gentle policy toward <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> at a news conference June 5, two days after the carnage in <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>, when he said he did not intend to respond emotionally to events in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the students struggling for democracy would be hurt if the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> went beyond cutting military ties with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. `` I do n't want to see a total break in this relationship and I will not encourage a total break,'' he said. To this day, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomatic and economic ties to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> are intact. Ambassador <PERSON> Lilley </PERSON> has not been recalled for `` consultations,'' a traditional signal of disapproval. The staff at the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> embassy in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> and at four consulates through the country has not been trimmed. The supposition is that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> are holding back on the theory the situation in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> is stabilizing, that the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> leadership will forgo further excesses. But on Thursday, three Chinese were sentenced to death in connection with the burning of a train and the beating of security officials during pro-democracy demonstrations in <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>. These were the first announced death sentences since Army troops went into action in <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>. State television in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, meanwhile, showed reputed protest leaders being crowded into police vans, their heads shaven and signs dangling from their necks describing their alleged crimes. In less than two weeks, the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> government has reported arresting more than 1,000 people in a nationwide crackdown. Under Presidents <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, enormous pressure was exerted on the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> was spared as <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON> appeared to be steering his country toward both political and economic reform. And yet, the student rebellion _ and the crackdown _ did not come out of the blue. <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> had spoken out repeatedly against student demands for greater democracy. `` They do not realize that capitalism is not feasible in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>,'' he said after protests in the winter of 1986-87. Hope, more than fact, nurtured the notion in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> that <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON> and his heirs were secretly supporting democratic trends.

 Southern Baptists wrapped up their first stay in this gambling city by urging states to enact legislation restricting abortions except to save the mother's life. The nation's largest Protestant body also approved resolutions Thursday condemning past racism within its ranks and calling for an end to happy hours at taverns throughout the nation. The resolutions were approved at the end of the three-day Southern Baptist Convention that attracted 20,423 delegates. Baptist officials said it was the sixth largest Baptist convention in 132 years, despite fears that many would stay away because of concerns over the <LOCATION> Sin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> image of <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> and its distance from traditional Baptist strongholds. The convention rejected arguments that abortions should be permitted in cases of rape or incest or if the fetus is severely deformed. One delegate objected that the resolution would call for abortion laws that require `` moral heroism.'' `` We do though want to say we do not want to victimize the child in the womb because evil things have happened to bring that child into the womb,'' said <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Coppenger </PERSON>, chairman of the denomination's <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Resolutions The resolution noted that a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision is pending that may reopen the possibility of broader state restrictions on abortion. It also reaffirmed the support of the 14.8 million-member denomination for a constitutional amendment to prohibit abortion except to prevent the imminent death of the mother. The convention, formed in 1845 in a dispute with Northern Baptists over slavery, said in a resolution on racism that the denomination repents of past bigotry. It called for members and churches `` to reach across racial boundaries, establishing fraternal rather than paternal friendships.'' The resolution also called upon the predominantly white denomination to bring about greater racial and ethnic representation at every level of the church. About 300,000 Southern Baptists are black. The denomination stopped short of approving an amendment condemning apartheid in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> because of concerns it would hurt evangelistic efforts there. The racism issue arose in the denomination last fall when a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, Dr. <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Caine </PERSON> <PERSON> Sr. </PERSON>, reportedly said in a commission meeting that the late Rev. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> was a fraud. <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> reported <PERSON> Caine </PERSON> also said apartheid in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> `` does n't exist anymore and was beneficial when it did, because it meant separate development.'' Delegates also approved a resolution on drunken driving that seeks increased excise taxes on alcohol, no more use of celebrities to promote drinking and the elimination of happy hours in which drinks are discounted.

 Ambassadorial nominee <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> ended his confirmation hearings by insisting he was unaware until December 1986 of <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s secret resupply operation to the Contra rebels in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, but a leading Democrat says he's unconvinced. <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> asserted Thursday he did n't tell then-Vice President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> about the resupply network because <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> did n't learn the extent of North's involvement until two months after one of the network's planes was shot down in October 1986 <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> that had he known about the resupply effort, he would have `` taken steps to stop the operation.'' The panel of 10 Democrats and nine Republicans will vote Tuesday on whether to recommend to the full <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> that the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>'s former station chief in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> be confirmed as ambassador to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> had been <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s national security adviser when he was vice president. Committee members said the vote is likely to be close, although there were indications at least one Democrat on the panel might vote for <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON>. Democrats repeatedly challenged <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON>'s credibility and said his alleged lack of judgment disqualifies him for confirmation as an ambassador. Sen. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Robb </PERSON>, D-Va., said through a spokeswoman that `` barring evidence of lying or perjury'' he is leaning toward confirmation `` He wants to review all of the evidence and he plans to make a conscientious decision,'' said spokeswoman <PERSON> Julia </PERSON> <PERSON> Sutherland </PERSON>. At the hearing, Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>, D-Calif., referred to a two-page January 1985 memo to North which, according to <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>, showed that <PERSON> Felix </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, a longtime friend with whom <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> was in frequent contact, was involved with the Contras The memo was dated several days after <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> met with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> in the vice president's office. <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> said he could n't remember whether <PERSON> North </PERSON> also attended what turned out to be the first of three meetings between <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> testified that Contra resupply was `` absolutely not'' discussed at the January meeting. <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON>, who said he sent <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> to <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> to assist that country's military, insisted he first learned <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> had something to do with the Contras in August 1986. That's when <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> complained that crooked arms merchants were gouging the Contras in a scandal he said could become another Watergate. <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> says he did n't tell <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, but rather convened a meeting four days later with representatives of various agencies, including the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. North did n't attend, even though <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> asked that he do so. But <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> asserted he did n't learn of the extent of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION>'s involvement in the operation until December 1986 when he said <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> detailed it for him North had contacted <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> to complain about <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>' not using secure communications equipment and about allegedly stealing a plane belonging to the Contras. But <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> said he failed to conclude from those incidents or the August 1986 meeting that <PERSON> North </PERSON> was running a resupply operation or that <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> was part of it. In December 1986, <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> telephoned <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> and told him he and <PERSON> North </PERSON> had agreed to keep <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> in the dark. <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> said he was `` furious'' with <PERSON> North </PERSON> and `` felt very let down'' by <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>. `` I faulted myself for not putting the pieces together,'' <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> said. `` You are trying to convince us of an elaborate conspiracy'' to keep <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> from knowing about Contra assistance run by <PERSON> North </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>. North and courier <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> knew about <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>' role, as did <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickering </PERSON> and Col. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Steele </PERSON> in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, so `` why did n't you know?'' asked <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON>. `` That's a pretty sweeping assertion,'' responded <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON>, who said at least two <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military officials who dealt with <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> testified they did n't know he was involved in the resupply network. <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON> said he regards <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON>'s performance Thursday as no more complete or satisfactory than his testimony at the first round of his confirmation hearing in May. In May, <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON> accused <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON> of sponsoring `` a free-lance covert operation out of the vice president's office'' to help resupply the Contras during a congressional ban on military aid to the rebel force.

<HEAD>Researchers Find That Light Can Reset Biological Clock</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAUL RECER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Science Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Scientists in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> are learning to treat jet lag, insomnia and other symptoms of a jangled body clock with carefully controlled doses of ordinary light. Dr. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Czeisler </PERSON> and colleagues at the <ORGANIZATION> Brigham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> reported today that they succeeded in consistently resetting the body clocks of test subjects using timed exposures to a light about as bright as the rising sun Their account of the experiments was published in Science magazine. <PERSON> Czeisler </PERSON> said the wake-rest cycles of the subjects could be moved forward or back with ease, but the changes lack the precision needed for a useful therapy for jet setters or for those with troubled sleep. But, eventually, he said, the study will develop the techniques needed to use light to change the body clock and relieve the wilting weariness many feel when their life style is out of phase with the sun. <PERSON> Czeisler </PERSON> said the research proved conclusively that light can send a signal to the brain to reset the biological clock. When such light shows up at the wrong time, it jumbles the body's wake-sleep cycle _ called the circadian rhythm Airline travelers know this disorder as jet lag, but it's also a problem for night shift workers and for thousands of people with sleep disorders, said <PERSON> Czeisler </PERSON>. Many airline schedules aggravate jet lag, he said, because travelers are forced to cross many time zones in darkness and arrive at their destination just as the sun comes up. `` When you leave here to fly overnight to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the flight arrives over there at 6 or 7 in the morning,'' he said. `` When you go outside, you are getting an exposure to light that is resetting you in exactly the opposite direction than what you wish to be set. It is resetting you for <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, instead of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Czeisler </PERSON> said a flight that arrives in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> later in the day would be easier on the body clock, but not enough is known yet about the effects of light on human circadian rhythm to adjust travel times precisely. `` The system is much more complicated than we previously thought,'' he said. To better understand the body clock, <PERSON> Czeisler </PERSON> and other investigators put 14 young men into a darkened laboratory free of any external time cues, and then exposed them to light from fluorescent lamps that mimicked the intensity of the dawning sun. <PERSON> Czeisler </PERSON> said the researchers found they could reset the body clock of the test subjects in any direction, depending on when the light was applied. He said exposure at one part of the cycle would move the body clock backward, an eastward time shift, while exposure at another time would have the opposite effect. Exposure at some points in the biological day, said <PERSON> Czeisler </PERSON>, would cause no change. Circadian cycles of the test subjects were determined by measurements of body temperature, hormone levels, kidney function and alertness, all of which are affected by the body clock. Unlike travelers, they were exposed only to the light called for in the experiment. <PERSON> Czeisler </PERSON> said all light exposure durations, intensities and frequencies influence the body clock. <PERSON> Czeisler </PERSON> said it's now believed that light striking the retina of the eye sends a signal down a nerve pathway to the hypothalamus in the brain. This organ, which can control sleep, alertness and other body functions, seems to be reset daily by light. This is the reason, <PERSON> Czeisler </PERSON> said, that night shift workers who commute home at dawn may spend years trying to adjust to their work schedule. `` The morning light resets their internal clock in a way that keeps their body scheduled to be day-active and asleep at night, even if they are trying to do the opposite. They may spend their careers fighting their internal biological clock,'' he said.

<TEXT>
 Three recovering Soviet alcoholics are returning home from a two-month tour of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> with best wishes from President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s physician and cheers from thousands of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> comrades in Alcoholics Anonymous. About 20,000 AA members they met during their cross-country travels autographed a copy of `` Alcoholics Anonymous,'' the 50-year-old bible of the self-help organization, and they plan to present the book to Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. <PERSON> Victor </PERSON>, 42, <PERSON> Sasha </PERSON>, 43, and <PERSON> Volodya </PERSON>, 37, who follow the AA tradition in refusing to use their last names, belong to a fledgling AA group called `` <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> Beginners,'' which held its first meeting in August 1987. The 40 members of the group meet every night of the week in the Soviet capital to help each other maintain their newfound sobriety. The three members who have toured the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> since April 10 were astonished to find so many AA members _ an estimated 835,500 last year. But the 12-step AA program of recovery from alcoholism is the same in both countries, they discovered. `` This program treats the spiritual soul of man,'' <PERSON> Victor </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> cinematographer, told a news conference Thursday at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>. `` It is a paradox,'' he said, `` but with the recovery of the spirit a person can be healed of the disease.'' The Rev. J.W. <PERSON> Canty </PERSON>, an Episcopal priest from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> who helped start the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> group, credited <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s liberal reform policies for allowing AA to flourish in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Without <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, `` AA would have to function underground,'' said <PERSON> Canty </PERSON>, chairman of the non-profit <ORGANIZATION> Soviet-U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alcoholism </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Addiction </ORGANIZATION> and Peace in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and organizer of the tour. Altogether, there are fewer than 100 Soviet AA members. `` It's very small, but it's a beginning,'' <PERSON> Canty </PERSON> said `` It's working, slowly but well. If you can save even one life, that's an enormous contribution.'' Since they arrived in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the three Soviets have attended scores of AA meetings _ including one in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> that drew 1,100 people _ and visited alcoholism treatment centers across the country, from <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. They also met with such celebrities as <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kitty </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, both recovering alcoholics, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, Lady <PERSON> Bird </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> and Dr. <PERSON> Burton </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> physician, who applauded their AA membership. At their meeting at the White House on Monday, the Soviet visitors gave <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> a `` <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> Beginners'' lapel button, which he promised to pin on the president's jacket even though <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is only a moderate social drinker. They will end their <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> tour this weekend in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, with a side trip to <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, where they will attend a Sunday school class led by former President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>. `` Perestroika is a very popular word now in my country,'' <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> told reporters, referring to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policy of restructuring the Soviet economy. `` We alcoholics can restructure ourselves and become better, happier persons,'' he said. `` I am rebuilding my life.''

<HEAD>Activists Say Civil Rights Reversals Show Reagan Agenda at Work</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Civil rights activists are accusing the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> of `` redneck justice'' and urging <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to stem what they say is a reactionary tide threatening 35 years of progress for minorities and women. The court's ruling Thursday on a racial harassment case is one of several new decisions showing that a newly solidified conservative majority on the court is intent on carrying out former President <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s agenda, civil and women's rights groups say. The court, by a 5-4 vote, barred the use of a key 1866 civil rights law to fight racial harassment. But the justices voted unanimously to uphold use of the law, originally intended to help freed slaves, to sue private individuals for other forms of discrimination. <PERSON> Molly </PERSON> <PERSON> Yard </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION>, said conservatives on the court `` again revealed themselves to be hostile and insensitive to the progress of the last 20 years. Redneck justice meted out with country club manners is no less painful than the real thing.'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Buchanan </PERSON> of the liberal People for the American Way said, `` It's a sad commentary on the state of the court's general outlook on civil rights that today's decision must be greeted with a measure of relief.'' Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., urged President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to join <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in proposing bills to reverse the high court rulings `` Taken separately, each of these retreats would be a source of genuine concern,'' he said. `` Together they are a serious threat to the 35 years of progress we have achieved toward a better and fairer society.'' Thursday's ruling follows three other significant high court setbacks for those urging more aggressive steps to combat bias. Last January, the court banned racial quotas in the awarding of public works projects by state and local governments. On June 5, the justices restricted the use of statistical evidence to prove an employer illegally relegates minorities or women to lower-paying jobs. And just last Monday, the court significantly expanded the power of white men to challenge court-approved affirmative action plans, even years after those plans took effect. Addressing the latest ruling, <PERSON> Julius </PERSON> <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> and Educational Fund said it means `` employers who do not want blacks on their work force can simply hire blacks and harass them on the job until they quit.'' <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Fein </PERSON>, a conservative who keeps a close watch on high court rulings, said civil rights groups were exaggerating the significance of the decision. But he agreed that `` there is a conservative five-member majority now changing the evaluation and approach to the civil rights law.'' The court acted in the case of <PERSON> Brenda </PERSON> <PERSON> Patterson </PERSON>, a black teller for a credit union in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>. She said her boss harassed her by ordering her to do menial tasks, such as sweeping floors. The court's ruling bars her from suing her employer for big-money punitive damages for alleged harassment. It does not prohibit her or others with similar complaints from suing under a 1964 federal civil rights law that has less sweeping financial remedies. Also, the 1964 law applies only to businesses with at least 15 employees, excluding some 15 percent of the American work force. The 1866 law covers all employers. Writing for the court Thursday, Justice <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, the court's newest member, denied the court was turning its back on minorities. `` Neither our words nor our decisions should be interpreted as signaling one inch of retreat from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' policy to forbid discrimination,'' he said. But he said the court's job is to interpret the law _ not rewrite it to the liking of civil rights advocates. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said the 1866 law governs contractual rights _ such as hiring and promotion decisions _ and not other forms of conduct by an employer, including an order to sweep floors. Justice <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON>, in a dissenting opinion, said, the court is engaging in a `` hypertechnical'' reading of the law that ignores its larger purpose. Joining <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> were Chief Justice <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON> and Justices <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>, <PERSON> Antonin </PERSON> <PERSON> Scalia </PERSON> and <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> and <PERSON> Scalia </PERSON> are <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> appointees; <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON> was promoted to chief justice by the former president. White had been appointed by former President <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>. In a separate decision Thursday, the court said states and state officials may not be sued under a related 1871 law that protects civil liberties. The 5-4 ruling in a case from <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> said states and their officials are not `` persons'' as envisioned by the 1871 law.

<HEAD>US Officials Wonder Whether Arrested General Was Corrupt or Subversive</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The arrest of a decorated Cuban Army general on corruption charges has left <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials wondering about the possibility of unrest within that country's upper military ranks. The officials acknowledged Thursday they have no hard evidence to dispute official assertions in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> that Gen. <PERSON> Arnaldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> was taken into custody because he had engaged in `` grave acts of corruption and dishonest use of economic resources.'' But the officials, all insisting on anonymity, also said they could not rule out the possibility that there was more to the arrest than meets the eye. A number of <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON>'s subordinates were reported to have been arrested as well. <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> has thus far been generally immune to the kind of upheavals that have afflicted other communist states and has refused to undertake the reforms being practiced in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and elsewhere. One reason for the official caution here in assessing the situation is that rumors of high-level discontent have circulated in <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> for 30 years but outright acts of rebellion have been exceedingly rare. Under the rule of President <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> has been one of the most stable countries in the communist world or in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> is a veteran of fighting in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> and also served as commander of Cuban forces in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> in the mid-1980s. According to <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON> <PERSON> Fermoselle </PERSON>, a Cuban exile and an expert on the Cuban military, <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> was awarded the title `` Hero of the Revolution'' in 1984. A Council of State resolution, approved on Jan. 1, 1984, said that <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> `` carried out several internationalist missions with a particular spirit of sacrifice'' and he was cited for a `` brilliant performance as commander of Cuban troops in <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Fermoselle </PERSON> has written. <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> also was praised for `` his honesty, unselfishness, spirit of sacrifice, purity, desire to excel and heroism.'' <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> joined <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>'s rebel army in 1958. Among the important positions he has held was Commander of the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> commanded <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> forces believed to number about 500. Gen. <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON> <PERSON> Del </PERSON> <PERSON> Pino </PERSON>, the highest ranking military officer ever to defect from <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>, disclosed Thursday that Defense Minister <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>, brother of the president, had said in a speech Wednesday that many of <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON>'s subordinates were arrested as well. <PERSON> Del </PERSON> <PERSON> Pino </PERSON>, who defected two years ago, said he believes that the arrests were based on a high-level of discontent within <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON>'s command which `` could have led to an uprising'' against <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> <PERSON> Del </PERSON> <PERSON> Pino </PERSON> said he believes there was a relationship between the arrest of <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> on Wednesday and the sacking of Transportation Minister <PERSON> Diocles </PERSON> <PERSON> Torralba </PERSON> the day before. He said <PERSON> Torralba </PERSON>, during his military career, was one of the `` most beloved and intelligent'' officers and had become `` the best prepared and most intelligent personality in the Cuban government.''

 In the visual world of computers, a young blind woman envisions a new life. <PERSON> Vera </PERSON> <PERSON> Saliba </PERSON> moved to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> 5 -LCB- years ago from her violent homeland in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> only to find a future in a field mostly for those who can see. On Sunday, Ms. <PERSON> Saliba </PERSON> graduates from the <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineering </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>. She overcame her disability to become one of the college's top computer science students. `` It always amazed me how much you could do with them,'' said the 22-year-old honors student. She uses a Braille keyboard and printer. She hopes to soon put her knowledge to work developing software programs to give disabled people greater access to computers. `` There is a lot I can do now,'' Ms. <PERSON> Saliba </PERSON> said. `` If I write one program that will improve things for disabled individuals in general, that would be a great reward for me.'' She said she worries daily about her parents and four siblings who remain in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. But she wants to stay in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> wants to hire her, but she needs a work permit. The company is working with her in preparing her case before immigration officials. Ms. <PERSON> Saliba </PERSON> has stayed in the country on a student visa. Ms. <PERSON> Saliba </PERSON> maintained a 3.7 grade point average at the university. Few of her textbooks were available in <LOCATION> Braille </LOCATION>. She learned by listening to people reading the texts aloud and reviewing class notes they helped her take. A black Labrador retriever named <PERSON> Amaris </PERSON> guided her to classes. She took all of her exams verbally. She applied the lessons learned in research projects on her specially equipped computer. She said her blindness `` does n't bug me, really,'' but she admitted to feeling frustrated at times. `` There were times I just wanted to give up,'' she said. `` The thing is I do n't believe in giving up because ... what's left in life if you give up?'' Much of her frustration is rooted in not being able to communicate often with her family. She has not been able to get through by telephone or mail recently. `` I'm just hoping they're still alive and they're still OK,'' she said. Her vision began to deteriorate at age 4, when the nerve relaying visual signals to the brain was cut off for unknown reasons. At 7, she could no longer read and she was blind by 13. On a two-week tourist visa to visit a brother studying in <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, she decided to stay and enrolled at a high school. She was encouraged in her studies by <PERSON> Narragansett </PERSON> <PERSON> High </PERSON>'s guidance office director, <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> Allaire </PERSON>. `` He's my <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dad,'' she said. <PERSON> Allaire </PERSON> is flying to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> to attend her graduation. Scholarships and grants allowed her to go to college. `` She's a real top student and she has changed a lot of attitudes on campus toward students with disabilities,'' said <PERSON> Connie </PERSON> <PERSON> Burton </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> UCSD </ORGANIZATION>'s director of disabled students services. `` She just seems to have a natural ability for computer programming.''

 Surgeon General <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Everett </PERSON> <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> says he wants to maintain his high public profile after he leaves office next month by using every outlet to deliver his health teachings `` as long as people will listen.'' As he prepares to close out a seven-year stint as the nation's top health adviser during which he made <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> aware of AIDS and encouraged millions to quit smoking, `` the achievements are way ahead of the failures,'' he said `` I leave with a very good feeling,'' <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> told reporters at a breakfast session on Thursday. He plans to leave this job in the <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> on July 13 and begin to write his memoirs. After that, he said, `` I will use the written word, the spoken word and whatever I can in the electronic media to deliver health messages to this country as long as people will listen,'' he said. The imposing, silver-bearded pediatrician with a reputation for straight talk about sensitive issues and the popularity of a national folk hero wants to continue to be <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s `` health conscience.'' <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> said his most successful achievement as surgeon general was his relentless drive against smoking. He noted that during his tenure, the proportion of the nation that uses tobacco has dropped from 34 percent to 26 percent and the number of anti-smoking laws has burgeoned from 54 to more than 400 now. Asked what was his biggest `` turkey,'' he responded self-assuredly: `` I did n't know there were any.'' <PERSON> Koop </PERSON>, 72, said he enjoys a special satisfaction that he has turned around most of the liberal critics who put up a firestorm of opposition to his nomination by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in 1981. In the process, though, <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> alienated many conservatives with his no-nonsense report on the AIDS crisis, which advocated use of condoms and sex education beginning at young ages. And, though he remains an adamant abortion foe, he again drew their ire when he refused to issue a report requested by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on whether women suffer psychological harm from abortion. `` I never made any promises to espouse any causes, and all that I have done in this job is to face the issues that were there and to deal with them with as much integrity and honesty as I could,'' <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> said. He says this is what directed him earlier this year when he told <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> there was insufficient scientific evidence to conclude that abortions harm women psychologically. `` The people who asked me to do it, especially the president, had been misled into believing that what I would find would be so devastating that you could reverse <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON>,'' the 1973 <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling that legalized abortion during the first three months of pregnancy. The surgeon general has no real authority to set government policy. `` My only in influence was through moral suasion,'' he said. But he attained a popularity among the public that is unknown to most government officials, and to a large extent, he said, this protected him from attacks by the <LOCATION> White </LOCATION> <LOCATION> House </LOCATION>, where conservatives sometimes disagreed with him. `` I think there were many times when certain very conservative people in the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> would have done anything they could to shut me up,'' he said. Within a week after he issued his report on the deadly acquired immune deficiency syndrome, he said, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> staffers asked him `` to do an update ... to take out the word condom.'' He said no, and `` they left my office in a huff.'' <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> acknowledged that he had let the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration know he wanted to be secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, which includes the <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, whose <ORGANIZATION> Commissioned </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> the surgeon general oversees. But he denied being bitter about not getting the job. `` I would have liked to be secretary,'' <PERSON> Koop </PERSON> said. `` I think I could have done a very credible job.'' But before he was passed over, he said he was asked repeatedly what his reaction would be if he did not get the job. His response, which he said he feels is even more true now, was: `` I will be disappointed for a few days but probably very happy for the rest of my life.''

<HEAD>Actress Says She'll File Complaint over Traffic Arrest</HEAD>

 An attorney for <PERSON> Zsa </PERSON> <PERSON> Zsa </PERSON> <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON> said he will file a complaint accusing <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> police of roughing up the actress during her arrest for alleged traffic law violations. `` Right now, we are going to prepare a formal complaint to the police chief,'' Miss <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Gribow </PERSON>, said Thursday. `` She's standing up for the rights of the average person.'' Miss <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON> claims a `` gorgeous officer'' mistreated her, impounded her $ 215,000 car and misplaced a diamond brooch during her arrest Wednesday. At one point, she said, the officer stood `` looking like <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Selleck-plus </PERSON>. I said, ` Darling, you are so handsome, why are you doing that to me?' He must've had a bad night with his girlfriend.'' Miss <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON> held a news conference Thursday dressed in a sweater monogrammed with `` Rodeo Drive <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>.'' She showed bruises on her wrists and arms. `` I look as if I was in a war. I'm cut where they put those cuffs on and I'm black and blue all over,'' Miss <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON> said by telephone earlier. She was handcuffed and taken to police headquarters after allegedly slapping a policeman who pulled over her Rolls-Royce Corniche for expired license tags. She was booked for investigation of evading a policeman, battery on a policeman, driving without a valid license, driving an unregistered car and driving with an open flask of whiskey. Department of Motor Vehicles records show Miss <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON>'s driver's license expired on June 6, 1988, her birthday According to DMV records, she was born in 1923, but the reference book `` Filmgoer's Companion'' said she was born in 1919, making her 70 last week She was released Wednesday afternoon on her own recognizance and ordered to appear in court July 12. After the officer, whose name was n't disclosed, stopped her, he discovered her driver's license had also expired, police Lt. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. `` He proceeded to run a check on the license plate and license and she told him she was in a hurry and she left,'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. The officer chased her for about two blocks until she pulled over. As she stepped out of the vehicle she slapped him, <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said. But Miss <PERSON> Gabor </PERSON> said she was dragged out of her car by the officer, who was screaming obscenities at her throughout the incident. `` I'm afraid now of a policeman,'' she said. `` Darling, my nails are all broken.''

<HEAD>Study Says Hispanics Hurt Sharply By Minimum Wage Veto</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Minorities and the working poor will be especially hurt by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s veto of legislation that would have raised their hourly wages to $ 4.55 by 1992, a study says. The veto would particularly hit hard black and Hispanic workers, who have seen their earnings erode over the decade, said a study released Thursday by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. The minimum wage, $ 3.35 an hour, has n't been lifted since 1981. According to the center, an independent organization that specializes in issues affecting low and moderate-income Americans, Hispanics and blacks are 40 percent more likely to be paid at or near the minimum wage than white workers. Yet a full-time, year-round worker earning the minimum wage and supporting a family of three falls $ 2,900 below the poverty line, the study said. In 1979, the minimum wage put a family of three at 104 percent of the poverty level. Today, one in every four black and Hispanic workers paid by the hour now receives a wage too low to lift a family of three out of poverty, even if the worker is employed full-time, the study said. `` The dramatic drop in the value of the minimum wage has compounded the earnings problems of poor and minority workers and increased their poverty rates,'' said study author <PERSON> Isaac </PERSON> <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON>. `` To these workers, the president's veto of legislation boosting the minimum wage is ominous news.'' Last year, 21 percent of Hispanic workers and 21 percent of black workers made less than $ 4.50 an hour, compared with 15 percent of all white workers, <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON> said. Earlier this week, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> vetoed legislation that would raise the minimum wage to $ 4.55 an hour by 1992, insisting that the new minimum wage not exceed $ 4.25 an hour. The House on Wednesday was not able to muster the votes required to override the veto.

 Former national security adviser <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> today faces the judge who will handle his criminal trial in the Iran-Contra scandal. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Greene </PERSON>, given the <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> case two weeks ago, must deal with the same problem of classified information that plagued the government's prosecution earlier this year against <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>. <PERSON> Greene </PERSON>'s decisions will determine whether prosecutors are able to bring far-reaching conspiracy and theft charges against <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>. Rulings by <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> in the North case led to the government's abandoning such charges. They focus on the diversion of proceeds from the <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> arms sales to the Nicaraguan Contras. North's attorneys fought, largely successfully, to convince <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> that substantial amounts of highly classified material were relevant to <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s defense and had to be admitted as evidence. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence agencies refused to declassify much of the material, due to national security concerns, and the conspiracy and theft charges were dismissed. The office of independent counsel <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> is trying to avoid the problem in the <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> case. The prosecution is opposing <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>'s request to file a motion with the judge seeking a wide range of documents for use by the defense. <PERSON> Greene </PERSON>, who won a reputation in presiding over the break-up of <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T of moving complex cases along expeditiously, has indicated he wants to resolve the question of the conspiracy and theft counts soon. At today's court session, <PERSON> Greene </PERSON> said in a two-page order earlier this week, he wants to address ` the question whether, as in the case against <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>, the government will move to dismiss the counts charging conspiracy and theft of government property and when a decision ... is expected.'' <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said several months ago he hopes to be able to try <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> on those counts. If the prosecution is unable to keep those charges, the indictment against <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> will be reduced substantially. He is charged with a series of obstruction and false statement charges involving <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Those accusations focus on <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>'s alleged involvement in producing a phony chronology in connection with a 1985 arms shipment to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> North was convicted of aiding and abetting in that false chronology, and two other crimes. The false chronology said that no one in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government knew until January 1986 that a November 1985 shipment to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> contained Hawk missiles. The shipment, assisted by the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>, was retroactively legalized by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> with a written finding signed by the president the month after the shipment was made.

 Iran-Contra figure <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> faces a new charge of drunken driving, authorities in this <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, suburb said. <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> is appealing a conviction last month for the same offense. The 56-year-old retired <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> major general was arrested in the town of <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> early Wednesday morning, according to <PERSON> Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Kisner </PERSON>, public information officer for the town. She said the arrest occurred after a police officer spotted a suspicious looking vehicle that was moving very slowly and came to almost a complete stop at a green light. <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>, cited for drunken driving and refusing to give a breath or blood sample, was released on $ 750 cash bond after spending several hours in the <LOCATION> Fairfax </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> jail, <PERSON> Kisner </PERSON> said. He was convicted May 11 in <LOCATION> Fairfax </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> of driving with an alcohol level of 0.20, twice the legal limit in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. District Judge <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Kimble </PERSON> sentenced him to 30 days in jail, suspended his driver's license for six months, fined $ 500 and ordered to enroll in an Alcohol Safety Awareness program. <PERSON> Kimble </PERSON> then suspended the jail time and $ 200 of the fine and allowed <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> to drive his car to work and to the alcohol program. <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> filed an appeal and a new trial is scheduled for Aug. 24. <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> was a key figure who worked with former <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aide <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> in the Iran-Contra affair.

<HEAD>Drug Czar Bennett Approves Idea of Capital Punishment</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Drug czar <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> says that beheading some kinds of drug dealers would be a `` morally'' fitting punishment although difficult to implement under the American system of justice. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, interviewed Thursday on the `` Larry King Live'' television program on <ORGANIZATION> Cable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` We are not doing enough that is morally proportionate to the nature of the offense.'' His remarks were prompted by a caller's question, `` why not behead the ... dealers?'' as the law calls for in some <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> countries. `` What the caller suggests is morally plausible,'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said. `` It's legally difficult.'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>, who is director of the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Policy </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` Morally, I do n't have any problem with that at all.'' `` Ask most Americans if they saw someone on the streets selling drugs to their kids, what they would feel morally justified in doing _ tear them -LRB- the sellers -RRB- limb from limb,'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said. Asked by interviewer King, `` What should we do?'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> did not answer directly but said, `` It's not a moral problem. I used to teach ethics.'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>'s spokesman, <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>, said later <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> did not mean to approve beheading, just capital punishment for some forms of drug dealing.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Here, at a glance, are the major provisions of <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L bailout legislation adopted by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, and the differences from the version passed by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in April. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> approved the bill by a 320-97 vote late Thursday.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>CAPITAL</NOTE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> would require S & amp; L owners to risk at least $ 1.50 in tangible capital for every $ 100 in lending starting June 1, 1990. The standard would be raised in steps until it reaches $ 3 on Jan. 1, 1995. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> requires S & amp; Ls to meet a $ 1.50 standard by June 1, 1991. Both versions impose growth restrictions on solvent S & amp; Ls that fall below the standard.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>FINANCING</NOTE>
<TEXT>
 Both chambers provide for borrowing $ 50 billion over three years to close or merge failed S & amp; Ls and both provide ways to get around the automatic spending cuts of the Gramm-Rudman budget balancing law. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> adopted President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposal to keep the borrowing off the budget. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> would add the borrowing to the budget deficit, but keep the addition from triggering spending cuts. Both versions require a contribution of $ 6 billion from the industry-owned <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banks </ORGANIZATION> to offset repayment of the borrowing. They also require the industry to contribute at least $ 300 million a year to help pay the interest. <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> bills increase the insurance assessment on <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L deposits from 21 cents per $ 100 to 23 cents and bank premiums from 8 cents to 15 cents.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>ANTI-FRAUD</NOTE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> provides the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> with $ 75 million a year from 1989 to 1991 to detect and prosecute fraud at financial institutions, while the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> voted for $ 50 million a year. Both chambers raise the maximum civil penalties for reckless disregard for safety to $ 1 million a day. Criminal penalties would be $ 1 million per day or imprisonment for up to five years, or both.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>REGULATORY REORGANIZATION</NOTE>
<TEXT>
 Both bills expand the authority of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which currently insures commercial bank deposits, to savings and loan deposits as well. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, currently the regulator of <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls, would be split up. The examination and supervision wing of the agency would become part of the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. A separate independent board would oversee the money-borrowing functions of the regional home loan banks, previously overseen by the bank board. A new agency, the <ORGANIZATION> Resolution </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, would be created to close or sell off failed S & amp; Ls. It would dispose of the more than $ 300 billion in repossessed real estate owned by the institutions.
</TEXT>
<NOTE>MISCELLANEOUS</NOTE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> will require S & amp; Ls to hold 80 percent of their assets mostly in residential mortgages and consumer loans. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> requires only 60 percent but says consumer loans ca n't be used to meet the requirement. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> bans troubled institutions from accepting high-interest rate deposits placed by money brokers. The House version is similar but allows S & amp; Ls to apply for an exemption. The House version allows bank holding companies to buy both healthy and ailing thrifts immediately. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> provides a two-year delay before bank holding companies can buy healthy S & amp; Ls. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, but not the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, requires the industry-owned regional banks to provide $ 75 million a year for four years to subsidize housing for poor people, increasing to $ 150 million a year by 1995. The House also requires banks and <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls to disclose their record of serving the poor, minorities and women. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> allows S & amp; Ls to invest in junk bonds up to 11 percent of assets, more for state-chartered S & amp; Ls with extra capital. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> forbids thrifts from owning junk bonds but gives institutions two years to sell the high-risk, high-yield bonds they already own.

<TEXT>
 The savings and loan bailout bill approved by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> gives new weapons to battle `` redlining,'' the discrimination by banks and thrift institutions against loan applicants from poor and minority neighborhoods. By a 214-200 vote Thursday night, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> voted to include in the $ 157 billion bailout a requirement that lenders disclose both the number of loans they approve as well as the number of applications they get by race, income and sex. `` We know redlining is a reality,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Dellums </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Calif </LOCATION>., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caucus </ORGANIZATION> `` The banks and savings and loans do n't want this information to become public because they know what it would do. It would provide the basis to establish a national policy.'' The amendment, written by Reps. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, and Rep. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., also requires federal regulators to disclose their ratings on how well banks and S & amp; Ls lend money for community needs Civil rights and community activists have been demanding the release to the public of numerical ratings the government keeps on community lending in the wake of reports the past two years about redlining in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> and other cities. Redlining is a practice by which banks and <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls have used zip codes and other geographic factors to systematically deny loans to residents and businesses in areas with high concentrations of minorities or poor people regardless of the creditworthiness of the applicant. Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Conyers </PERSON>, D-Mich., said that without the provision, minorities would reap no benefit from the savings and loan bailout `` There is no way in the world I can go back to my constituency and explain to them why redlining is still allowed in this country,'' <PERSON> Conyers </PERSON> said. `` I ca n't stress enough the important dimension of this civil rights amendment.'' Opponents of the amendment, led by Reps. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Bartlett </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Texas </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Chalmers </PERSON> <PERSON> Wylie </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ohio </LOCATION>, said they were against redlining but argued that the issue had nothing to do with the bailout and should be addressed in a separate bill. <PERSON> Wylie </PERSON> also called the measure `` mischievous,'' saying the ratings could be misinterpreted by the public as an indication of the financial soundness of a bank or S & amp; L rather than how much it helps the local community. Both banks and regulators also have expressed fears that the disclosures will be used by community and civil rights activists to promote risky inner-city lending to borrowers who are not creditworthy. Sen. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, attempted to add a similar provision to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s version of the S & amp; L bailout but withdrew it in the face of overwhelming opposition. He promised that the issue would be considered in a separate <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> bill.

<HEAD>Government Urges Use of Aerosal Drug to Prevent Pneumonia</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Federal health officials are recommending aggressive use of a newly approved drug that protects people infected with the AIDS virus against a form of pneumonia that is the No. 1 killer of AIDS victims The Food and Drug Administration approved the drug, aerosol pentamidine, on Thursday. The announcement came as the <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> issued greatly expanded treatment guidelines recommending wider use of the drug in people infected with the AIDS virus but who may show no symptoms. Aerosol pentamidine has been widely available for several months to people infected with the human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, under a special <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> pre-approval distribution program. The cost of the drug, however, is a burden for many. Full <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> approval means that more insurance companies will cover at least part of the costs of the treatment, which runs about $ 150 for a monthly dose. Aerosol pentamidine, which is inhaled into the lungs, has been found to prevent pneumocystis carinii pneumonia. This form of pneumonia kills more than 60 percent of AIDS patients. The injectable form of pentamidine was approved in 1984 for patients already suffering from pneumocystis. But injections offered far less protection than the inhalable, aerosol form. Approval of the drug may help about 100,000 AIDS-infected people who are at risk of developing initial or subsequent bouts of pneumocystis, said Dr. <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, parent agency of both the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> and the Centers for Disease Control. Aerosol pentamidine, to by marketed by <ORGANIZATION> LyphoMed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Rosemont </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, will be labeled for use in patients who have had at least one episode of pneumonia or whose immune systems have deteriorated significantly, the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> said. The government estimates that between 945,000 and 1.4 million Americans are infected with the AIDS virus. About 120,000 people who have been tested at public counseling and testing centers have been informed that they are infected. The number of people who have been found through other sources to be infected is not known, <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said. <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> recommended that people who test positive for the virus, even though they may have no symptoms of the disease, have critical immune-system cells monitored every six months. These cells are called CD4 helper lymphocyte cells, which in healthy people appear at counts of about 1,000 or more. <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> also recommended that when the cell count drops below 200, patients should be started on one of two drugs that have been shown to protect against pneumocystis. `` The guidelines are likely to increase the demand for HIV antibody testing by persons who believe they may be at risk for infection,'' now that more can be done medically to prolong the lives of AIDS patients, <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said. More aggressive testing and monitoring will also raise the demand for medical services, <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> said. The <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION>'s Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report did not estimate how much health care costs would increase with increased testing, monitoring and administering of preventive drugs. Last week, at the Fifth International AIDS conference in <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION>, Dr. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>, former <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> director who is now assistant secretary for health, was quoted as saying increased monitoring of HIV-infected people and use of AIDS drug treatments could cost $ 2 billion to $ 3 billion.

<TEXT>
 Waiters at a well-known downtown restaurant thought they were making pretty good tips until the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> started checking out the tabs. Checking just the credit card receipts for meals served by nine waiters at the <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> Restaurant, the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> found that the nine failed to report nearly $ 145,000 in combined tip income for each year between 1982 and 1985. As a result, the nine were charged with filing a false income tax return. Eight of them pleaded guilty to one count each, and on Thursday they were sentenced to serve nights and weekends at a community correctional institute for up to four months. They also will have to pay back taxes, interest and penalties. `` This is probably the saddest day of my entire life,'' said <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Levaca </PERSON>, one of the waiters. `` I want to apologize to the court and keep my job so I can pay back this debt.'' He and the other four waiters who still work at the <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> will be able to continue doing so while serving their sentences. The ninth defendant, who now lives in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, also has pleaded guilty and will be sentenced later. According to a pre-trial statement from prosecutors, the waiters were reporting annual income ranging from $ 7,100 to $ 52,000 a year while really earning $ 27,000 to $ 67,000. This did not include meals paid for in cash.

 A jury recommended in a mock trial to award $ 136 million to neighbors of a federal uranium processing plant, a decision the neighbors' lawyer hopes will lead to a settlement. The jury issued the non-binding verdict Thursday on the second day of deliberations in a summary jury trial, an abbreviated procedure used by <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arthur </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Spiegel </ORGANIZATION> to encourage a settlement of the neighbors' $ 300 million lawsuit. `` We won 100 percent. We did n't lose a single issue of law,'' said <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Chesley </PERSON>, a lawyer for the 14,000 plaintiffs represented in the class-action lawsuit. The jury ruled that <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lead </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> operated the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION>'s Feed Materials Production Center in a way that caused neighbors to suffer emotional distress and lowered property values. National Lead, which operated the plant under contract to the federal government from 1951 through 1985, was sued with its parent firm, <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lead </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Chesley </PERSON> said he hopes the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, which represented the defendant companies in the lawsuit, will now settle the civil lawsuit The plaintiffs all live within five miles of the plant in <LOCATION> Fernald </LOCATION>, which is 18 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Gill </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s chief lawyer, declined to comment on a settlement, saying he would continue discussions with <PERSON> Chesley </PERSON> and would need to confer with his superiors. If there is no settlement, the case goes to a real trial Aug. 15 before <PERSON> Spiegel </PERSON>. The 38-year-old plant processes uranium used by <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reactors elsewhere in producing nuclear weapons. Environmentalists have been watching the case in hopes that the advisory verdict would affect other <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> installations nationwide that are reputed to be polluters. <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> lawyers argued that the defendant companies could not be found liable because they could only carry out the government's orders. The Energy Department estimates that 383,000 pounds of radioactive uranium oxide dust has been released from faulty exhaust-air filters since the plant opened. Government lawyers said the material has not endangered residents or harmed property. `` The jury believed they were reckless and careless the way they managed this plant ... They did n't give a hoot about us or the environment and now they are going to have to pay for it,'' said <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> Fernald </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Residents </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>. The jury recommended the damage amount would include $ 80 million for a fund to monitor the residents' medical problems, $ 55 million for punitive damages and $ 1 million for property damage. Jury foreman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Caplinger </PERSON>, questioned by the judge after Thursday's verdict, said the jury thought its decision could help persuade other contractors not to manage plants like National Lead ran the Fernald facility. <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Materials </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> has operated the plant since January 1986 and is not a defendant in the case.

 Surrounded by controversy, Premier <PERSON> Andreas </PERSON> <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> faces the toughest test of his 25-year political career in national elections Sunday. The results are expected to decide whether the 70-year-old former <ORGANIZATION> U. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> university </ORGANIZATION> professor will continue dominating <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>'s often-turbulent politics or end his career on a discordant note <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> first was elected in 1981 on an anti-American platform and promises of significant social change. Instead, he and members of his government have floundered since August over charges involving a multimillion-dollar financial scandal and illegal arms deals. Opponents often are critical of <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON>'s authoritarian style and sensitivity to criticism. But they have not discounted him, despite poor opinion poll ratings. `` He'll leave the country if he loses the election,'' said opposition legislator <PERSON> Virginia </PERSON> <PERSON> Tsouderou </PERSON> of the center-right <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Tsouderou </PERSON> claims <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> will leave whether his <ORGANIZATION> Panhellenic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> PASOK </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- gets second place or her party wins an outright majority in the 300-member parliament. <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> said he will stay regardless. `` I know what it is to be in the opposition, I'm a fighter,'' he said in a recent interview. But few political observers believe him, and even some party members doubt him. `` Papandreou is too sensitive to sit in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> and listen to criticism. If we lose, many of us in the party expect him to go, but his magnetism could pull off a miracle'' agreed a <ORGANIZATION> Panhellenic </ORGANIZATION> deputy running for re-election. He said <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON>'s style of `` one-man rule'' has alienated many party members. <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> rarely showed up in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, preferring to govern from his suburban residence. `` We realize that without him <ORGANIZATION> PASOK </ORGANIZATION> would have little chance of winning, but at the same time he could be a liability because of his controversial private life and financial scandals we have been burdened with,'' the deputy said on condition of anonymity. <PERSON> Harilaos </PERSON> <PERSON> Florakis </PERSON>, secretary-general of the <ORGANIZATION> Greek </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, believes <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> `` will be dumped as party leader if he loses the election.'' Observers speculate that if the Panhellenics loose their overall majority, the elections would enable the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> to play a role in forming a new government. `` Despite statements by <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> PASOK </ORGANIZATION> that they will reject communist support to form a coalition government, anything can happen,'' a West European diplomat said on condition of anonymity. <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> was dean of the economics department at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION>. He returned to <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> in 1959 after a 20-year absence. With his charismatic personality and gift for oratory, he used his father's <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> to form his own party following the collapse of the military dictatorship that ruled <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> from 1967-1974. <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> concedes his popularity has diminished. He told the pro-government daily <ORGANIZATION> Ta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nea </ORGANIZATION> that the financial scandal and his open affair with a flight attendant half his age have affected his popularity. <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> divorced his American-born wife, <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON>, on June 9 ending their 38-year marriage. The divorce frees him to marry <PERSON> Dimitra </PERSON> <PERSON> Liani </PERSON>, who critics charge influences his decisions. <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> admits he `` bounces his ideas off <PERSON> Liani </PERSON> because she has good instinct. But I do not always follow her advice.''

<HEAD>Report Says Navy Wasting Billions in Intentional Sinkings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The ocean floor is full of sunken treasure from old military ships that have been blown up as targets or sunken as artificial reefs, an investigative report says. Although there may be no doubloons or pieces of eight in the newest denizens of <PERSON> Davy </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>'s Locker, $ 17 million in recoverable goods has been destroyed on board 24 ships sunk in recent years as reefs or in target practice, the report by the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s inspector general said. An additional $ 40 million will be lost unless something is done to salvage items from 64 vessels that now await a similar fate, it said. There are, in fact, `` significant amounts'' of gold and silver _ to be salvaged from communications and code equipment, the report says. Mostly the wasted goods consist of power tools such as lathes, drill presses, band saws, pumps and office and electronic equipment. Inspectors also said there were operating room and dental equipment, including sterilizers; air conditioners and ice machines; silverware; radios and teletypes; new mattresses, still in plastic bags; and numerous spare parts. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> has been derelict in the proper management of the public property under its control,'' the report concluded. Rep. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Broomfield </PERSON>, R-Mich., who released the report, introduced legislation on Thursday to permit outside contractors to reclaim scrap items from such ships They would apply for the right to salvage items under sealed bids, <PERSON> Broomfield </PERSON> said. `` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> may be the most wealthy nation in the world, but we are not so wealthy that we can afford to dump millions of dollars worth of sophisticated equipment to the bottom of the ocean floor,'' he said in a statement. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> continues to buy some of the same items it has wasted, the inspector general's report said, and `` has ignored the possibility of re-usage.'' In a response, the service said it is `` reviewing the report to determine any appropriate action. This will include reviewing the cost estimates of the unrecovered materials, plus the associated recovery costs, equipment condition and applicability to current needs.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> added that it `` also plans to review its instructions governing the process and procedures for inactivating and stripping ships.'' The internal investigation was prompted by a complaint from <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Justen </PERSON>, whose <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, company had been hired to sink an old <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> ship under the artificial reef program. <PERSON> Justen </PERSON> complained that some $ 300,000 worth of reusable items were on the vessel, but he was unable to salvage them because of the time constraints of his contract. He told the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> that he was aware of other, similar cases, as well. The inspector general found confusion in the handling of decommissioned ships and few clear provisions for salvage.

<HEAD>Puerto Rican Nationalist Defiant During Sentencing</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Defiant to the end, a Harvard-educated Puerto Rican nationalist raised his fist and shouted `` Puerto Rico Libre'' after he was sentenced to 65 years in prison and fined $ 500,000. <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Segarra </PERSON> <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON>, who has already spent almost three years in jail awaiting trial on charges of masterminding a $ 7.1 million robbery at a <LOCATION> Wells </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fargo </LOCATION> depot, expressed no remorse during a politically charged, 27-minute speech before <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Emmet </PERSON> <PERSON> Clarie </PERSON> on Thursday. `` My conscience is clear,'' he told the judge. `` In my limited capacity I tried to bring about change.'' The 39-year-old <PERSON> Segarra </PERSON>, who had faced up to 165 years in prison, was convicted with three other Puerto Rican nationalists in April in the 1983 theft of a half-ton of money from the armored-car company's depot in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION> Only $ 80,000 has been recovered from what is believed to be the second-largest cash heist in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> history. After <PERSON> Clarie </PERSON> announced the sentence, <PERSON> Segarra </PERSON> turned to supporters in the packed courtroom and shouted the separatist slogan. About two dozen spectators responded with shouts of encouragement as <PERSON> Segarra </PERSON> was led from the courtroom. Before his sentencing, <PERSON> Segarra </PERSON> denounced <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy and pledged to continue fighting for Puerto Rican independence. `` I will keep my eyes on the prize because no price is too high to pay for freedom, justice and the dignity of the people,'' he said. The judge replied: `` Common crimes do not become political crimes simply because the criminal is a would-be politician.'' <PERSON> Clarie </PERSON> also denied <PERSON> Segarra </PERSON>'s charge that democracy is a sham in <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> and that the island is little more than a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> colony. The judge pointed to a recent referendum in which only 3 percent of Puerto Rican voters supported independence from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Segarra </PERSON>, convicted of charges including robbery, transportation of stolen money and conspiracy, denied he helped plan the <ORGANIZATION> Wells </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fargo </ORGANIZATION> robbery, as the prosecution alleged. But he has acknowledged that he knew about the robbery in advance and said he received the stolen money to finance the activities of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Macheteros </LOCATION>, Spanish for `` the machete wielders,'' a militant Puerto Rican separatist group. He and other defendants have said the government prosecuted them because of their political beliefs. Prosecutors pushed for the maximum sentence, saying <PERSON> Segarra </PERSON> was linked to several crimes in <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, including two bank robberies, an attack on a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> bus that left two sailors dead and the destruction of nine military planes worth $ 45 million. <PERSON> Segarra </PERSON>'s lawyer, <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinglass </PERSON>, said he would appeal. <PERSON> Segarra </PERSON> will be eligible for parole in 10 years, but probably will not be given serious consideration until he has served 20 years, <PERSON> Weinglass </PERSON> said. Earlier this month, <PERSON> Clarie </PERSON> imposed sentences of up to 15 years on the three others convicted with <PERSON> Segarra </PERSON>. In all, 16 people have been charged in the heist. One was acquitted; two, including <PERSON> Segarra </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Luz </PERSON> <PERSON> Berrios </PERSON> <PERSON> Berrios </PERSON>, pleaded guilty to lesser charges, and nine are awaiting trial. None were accused of actually taking part in the holdup; <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerena </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Wells </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fargo </ORGANIZATION> security guard at the time, is believed to have taken the money and fled to <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> with about $ 2 million.

 An area still recovering from a devastating thunderstorm was hit by showers and high winds for a second day in a row, hampering efforts to clean up trees and leaving an additional 22,000 homes without power in the nation's capital and suburban <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>. The second storm swept through the area late Thursday afternoon, creating havoc with rush-hour commuters for the second time in 24 hours. To make matters worse, dozens of traffic signals were out as a result of Wednesday's storm, which caused an estimated 150,000 power outages and felled hundred of trees. <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Tompkins </PERSON> said an estimated 12,600 homes in the northern section of the state were without power at the height of the storm, around 6 p.m. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Welle </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Potomac </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said the second storm, not as strong as the first, hampered efforts to repair the damage caused by the initial thundershower, which he said was the most disruptive in the company's 93-year history. `` We have to rebuild almost all of the electrical system from scratch,'' <PERSON> Welle </PERSON> said. `` At this rate, some people will probably be without power through the weekend.'' <ORGANIZATION> Pepco </ORGANIZATION> was giving out dry ice at two locations for people who owned freezers filled with food that was thawing. Even before the new storm, hundreds of trees still blocked side streets and were wrapped around felled power lines. City and county police directed traffic at key intersections where traffic lights were malfunctioning. Insurance industry analysts said private storm-related claims had already passed the $ 5 million mark, and would likely climb much higher. About 30 area schools were closed Thursday, due to the outages, and at least 16 were to remain closed today. Three UHF television stations, <ORGANIZATION> WETA </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> WHMM </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> WDCA </ORGANIZATION>, which share the same transmitter site, remained off the air Thursday. <ORGANIZATION> WDCA </ORGANIZATION> still had not returned to the air early this morning. <ORGANIZATION> PEPCO </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Eileen </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffin </PERSON> said about 300 crews were working around the clock to restore electricity. The utility was forced to call outside crews from as far as <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> to assist them in the effort.

<TEXT>
 Mass mailings by 100 senators during 1987-88 cost taxpayers more than $ 52.7 million, the congressional watchdog Common Cause says in a report. The 27 senators seeking re-election last year spent $ 20.1 million of the total, an average of 48 cents per household, according to the Common Cause study released Thursday. The per-household figures compared to an average of 31 cents for the 67 senators who were not campaigning for re-election, and 15 cents for six senators who retired in 1988. The study said taxpayer-financed mailing costs for both houses have increased from $ 48.9 million in fiscal 1978 to $ 113.4 million for fiscal 1988.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The opposition <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> won two parliamentary by-elections today and, according to an exit poll, inflicted stunning defeats on Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s Conservatives in elections for the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. Results early today from voting to fill two vacant House of Commons seats showed Labor holding on to the inner-city socialist strongholds of <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Glasgow </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Vauxhall </ORGANIZATION> district. `` The government is in trouble,'' Labor campaign manager <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> <PERSON> Gould </PERSON> declared. `` We have just started to see the beginning of a major shift in the underlying political agenda.'' Labor tried to turn the European campaign into a referendum on Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s 10 years in office. <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Clarke </PERSON>, Health Secretary in Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s government, blamed economic problems and the mid-term protest votes for the Conservatives' apparent defeats. `` But we've seen worse than this,'' said <PERSON> Clarke </PERSON>, arguing the Conservatives would recover before the next general election, which must be held by mid-1992. For her part, she told voters they should reject minimum-wage and other proposals of the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> that would introduce `` socialism by the back door.'' The exit poll gave the tiny environmental <ORGANIZATION> Green </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> third place in national voting for the first time. Official results are not due until early Monday, when voting for the 518-member body is complete in all 12 member nations of the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>. The computerized <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> poll of 7,500 voters showed Labor with 44 percent of the European vote, its best showing in more than a decade. The Conservatives took 32 percent. Those percentages would allow Labor to win 51 of 78 seats allocated to the British mainland in the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, up from the party's previous 32. The government's tally dropped from 26 from 45, according to the poll. The Scottish <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> gained one seat, the poll said. The Greens followed with 14 percent, according to the poll. The centrist <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> finished with 6 percent, the poll said. Such percentages would not give either of those two parties any seats on the European body. Minor parties captured the rest of the votes. The poll was conducted for the <ORGANIZATION> BBC </ORGANIZATION> by National Opinion Poll. In <ORGANIZATION> Vauxhall </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Kate </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoey </PERSON> won with a 9,766-vote majority, slightly more than the 1987 general election. The Conservative vote was down 10 percent at 5,425 votes, only 382 ahead of the centrist <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. In <LOCATION> Glasgow </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION>'s majority slumped by nearly two-thirds to 6,462, eroded by the Scottish <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. Laborite <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Watson </PERSON>'s 14,480 votes was a 10 percent drop, while the Scottish nationalist share was up 20 percent. The Conservatives ran third in the mainly working class district, getting 2,028 votes. The by-elections were called after the death of the previous <LOCATION> Glasgow </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> legislator and the retirement of the one in <ORGANIZATION> Vauxhall </ORGANIZATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s party retains a huge majority in the 650-member House of Commons. The Conservatives have 375 seats, Labor 229, the Social and <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> 19, and the splinter <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> three. The Scottish nationalists have four seats, and minority regional parties control the rest. In his comments, <PERSON> Gould </PERSON> said the Conservatives were hurt by Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s resistance to greater European unity and her often combative stance in the trade bloc. `` Now we see we are paying a price for Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> picking fights with everybody,'' said <PERSON> Gould </PERSON>. In addition to benefiting from high interest rates of 14 percent and unemployment of 6.4 percent, <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> has also been helped by a new, more centrist platform. Its plan drops the party's previous call for scrapping <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s nuclear arsenal unilaterally and shutting down <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> nuclear bases.

 A monthlong search for the last three crossbred dusky seaside sparrows, which had escaped from captivity during a storm, revealed no traces of the birds, and ornithologists are convinced the species is extinct. The quest by federal biologists ended Wednesday, two years to the day after the death of the last known pure dusky seaside sparrow, a small brown-and-white bird with a short buzzing trill. `` You ca n't come to any other conclusion because there's no habitat around here for them,'' said <PERSON> Herb </PERSON> <PERSON> Kale </PERSON>, vice president for ornithology at the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Audubon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>. By the 1950s, the birds' salt marsh habitat near the <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Johns </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> in central <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> was rapidly being consumed by development. Pesticides sprayed to control mosquitoes also hurt the birds. In 1966, the dusky seaside sparrow became the first species on the federal government's endangered species list. Kale became an adviser to a Disney World program that had tried since 1983 to mate the crossbred birds with a related species. But that program was devastated in March, when a storm pitched a palm frond through the fiberglass roof of the birds' compound and left a hole. When keepers arrived the next morning, they found one crossbred sparrow dead and two others gone. Another stayed in its cage during the storm, but flew off when keepers tried to put it in a more secure cage. The birds were born in captivity. They knew their natural salt marsh habitat only through careful recreations, so the birds are presumed dead. The federal government bought the 6,000-acre <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Johns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> River </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Refuge </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Brevard </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> to protect the species in 1972. `` Some would argue that we lost a scientific opportunity to learn something, although we've had those birds in captivity a fairly long time and learned about everything we could,'' said <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>, endangered species coordinator for the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Game </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fresh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Water </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. `` In an ecological sense, it's an absolutely totally insignificant loss,'' <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> said. `` In the philosophical sense, it would depend on whoever's talking to you.'' One last aerial survey of the salt marshes might be made today. But if no dusky sparrow is found, paperwork will be filed to have it removed from the federal endangered species list because it is extinct.

 <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> began counting ballots today from its snap national election, but politicians are already threatening to force another contest. A heavy turnout was reported Thursday as <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> also selected members of the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. Counting for the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> begins Sunday. Prime Minister <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Haughey </PERSON> called the election in hope of winning a majority in the Dail, or parliament, which would be his first in five tries. Leaders of the other parties offered no support. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukes </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Fine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gael </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Des </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Malley </PERSON>, leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Progressive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION>, declared on the eve of the election that they would not vote for <PERSON> Haughey </PERSON> for another term. The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> also ruled out any support for the 63-year-old <PERSON> Haughey </PERSON> and his <ORGANIZATION> Fianna </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fail </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, in part because of economic problems in <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. That raised the possibility of a split parliament, requiring yet another election to break the impasse. <PERSON> Haughey </PERSON> needed 83 seats to gain control of the 26th Dail, which has 166 members. The speaker customarily votes with the government and is automatically elected. Fianna Fail controlled 80 seats when the 25th Dail was dissolved. Even if <PERSON> Haughey </PERSON> musters a majority, or woos enough independents and minor party deputies to form a government, the cooperation that marked the 25th parliament appeared to be shattered. Fine <PERSON> Gael </PERSON> and the Progressive Democratic party had supported <PERSON> Haughey </PERSON> on his main economic policies. But the day before the election, a spokesman for those two parties said <PERSON> Haughey </PERSON> could expect no help, `` in view of him having cast aside the historic and unique consensus he and his government enjoyed in the last Dail.''

 Israeli warplanes blasted a base operated by Palestinian terrorist <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON> at dawn today in twin bombing runs. Two children were reported wounded. Six U.S.-built Skyhawk jets swooped down for the raid on the beachside <LOCATION> Rashidiyeh </LOCATION> refugee camp, police said. An army spokesman in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> said the planes hit all the targets. The spokesman said the base that was bombed had been used to launch guerrilla attacks against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and its self-declared security zone in southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The camp is 10 miles north of the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> border. A spokesman for <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Fatah-Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> said only that Israeli warplanes bombed positions of his group within the camp. A police spokesman said a 5-year-old girl and a 6-year-old boy were wounded in a two-story house. A nursery was also hit, but it had not yet opened for the day and no one was injured there, he said. No casualty figure at the military base was immediately available. Lebanese police initially said the target was a base for the <ORGANIZATION> Marxist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> for the Liberation of <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION>. However, they later corrected that report, saying the base belonged to <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON>'s group <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON>, whose real name is <PERSON> Sabri </PERSON> <PERSON> Banna </PERSON>, split from <PERSON> Yasir </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s mainstream <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION> group of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> in 1973. Three years later, he formed his underground group. He has since been blamed for dozens of terrorist attacks across <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. The attacks include simultaneous assaults at <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> airports in 1985 that killed 20 people. Nidal guerrillas also were held responsible for seizing a Pan American jumbo jet Sept. 5 at an airport in <LOCATION> Karachi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. The terrorists opened fire inside the aircraft, killing 20 people. Today's attack was <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s eighth on <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> this year. By police count, nine people have been killed and 58 wounded in the previous raids beginning Jan. 11. On Wednesday, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> warplanes bombed a guerrilla hideout used by the <ORGANIZATION> Marxist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> and three other radical Palestinian factions in the <LOCATION> Chouf </LOCATION> mountains southeast of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. Three guerrillas were killed and nine wounded in that attack.

<HEAD>Japan Follows Canada, U.S. in Ban of Ivory Imports</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, the world's largest importer of ivory, will ban most of those shipments in keeping with international calls to protect African elephants, government officials said today. Their pledge came one day after Canadian officials said they too would ban ivory imports into their country. The Japanese <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> said the Japanese ban will take effect Monday. It will exclude, however, raw African ivory that has been specially certified under an international agreement. Such ivory accounts for about 13 percent of the imports. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> is following the lead of the majority of industrial nations that already banned ivory imports, <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> official <PERSON> Toru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takimoto </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> announced June 5 that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was banning the import of ivory from all countries. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> accounts for 40 percent of all world ivory consumption, followed by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> at 15 percent. In 1988, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> imported 132 tons of ivory. The Japanese use ivory mainly for seals that can make impressions on documents, musical instruments and jewelry. The Japanese ban complies with a 1973 international agreement to protect animals threatened by extinction by restricting trade in such animals and products made from them. African producers certify their ivory under rules of that agreement. However, more than 80 percent of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s ivory imports come from non-African countries, including <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>. Most of that ivory lacks such certification. Though some African countries still permit limited exports of the certified ivory, four major producers _ <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tanzania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Gambia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Somalia </LOCATION> _ have called for a total ban on trade in ivory. They say such action is needed to stem the swift decline in the population of African elephants. The population of African elephants in 1988 was estimated at 625,000, down from 1.2 million in 1981, according to the World Wildlife Fund. <PERSON> Tamotsu </PERSON> <PERSON> Ishibashi </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ivory </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Craft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cooperative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said the ban will hurt <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s traditional ivory-carving industry. `` The majority of ivory craftsmen have passed their techniques of carving ivory from generation to generation, and the new restriction certainly will affect them severely,'' Ishibashi said in a telephone interview. About 25,000 ivory craftsman work in 80 Japanese workshops, producing $ 13.8 million worth of ivory products every year. Ishibashi predicted <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s ivory imports would drop to 15-20 percent of the amount now imported. `` Of course, prices of ivory products will skyrocket soon, and ivory products will no longer be for ordinary people,'' he said. In announcing the Canadian ban, External Affairs Minister <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> said his government intended `` to discourage any further speculative slaughter of these magnificent animals.'' <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> will also support an international ban on commercial trading in African elephant ivory.

<HEAD>Northeast Summer Drought Now Remote, But Florida Reports Water Shortages</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 The Northeast's rains this spring have filled reservoirs, making the possibility of a summer drought remote, but <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> residents have been asked to conserve water due to sparse rainfall. Officials have placed all of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> except the <LOCATION> Panhandle </LOCATION> under some water-use restrictions. Most restrictions are voluntary, but many south and central areas of the state have banned lawn watering. In the Northeast, an unusually dry winter brought drought emergency regulations. But since then many areas received record amounts of rain. Now the reservoirs are nearly full. `` It just goes to show that weather is a fickle thing,'' said <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Basin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Commission </LOCATION> on Thursday. `` One month you're in a drought, the next month you have rivers and streams overflowing their banks. It's just a whimsical element you're dealing with.'' A drought warning issued Jan. 16 for 7 million people in <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> who depend on the <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> basin ended May 12, thanks to the spring rain. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> declared a drought emergency in March after a dry winter dropped reservoirs to 55 percent capacity. City reservoirs are now at 97.1 percent capacity and the city has ended the drought emergency. <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> officials announced Tuesday that they were easing restrictions but stopped short of declaring a formal end to the drought emergency for the 2.5 million people in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> and 43 surrounding communities that get water from the Quabbin Reservoir.

 When Korsair leaped from a cart at <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, `` sit,'' `` stay,'' and `` heel'' fell on deaf ears. The 3-year-old Belgian sheepdog, a champion show dog valued as high as $ 50,000, escaped and is still missing, and he understands only French. <PERSON> Korsair </PERSON>'s owner, Frenchman <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>, said Thursday that when he transferred Monday from a flight from <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> to a flight to <LOCATION> Lansing </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, he thought his best friend was safely with him. But <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Rob </PERSON> <PERSON> Doughty </PERSON> said that at some point during the transfer the cage door flew open and Korsair leaped from the cart and bounded across airplane taxi lanes into a field. United personnel chased the dog in their cargo carts until they became bogged down in the rain-soaked field. They cornered <PERSON> Korsair </PERSON> once, but the dog snarled and bared its teeth before escaping, <PERSON> Doughty </PERSON> said. The handlers tried to order the dog using standard English commands, but the dog did not understand, he said. `` We train our people to handle animals, making sure they're comfortable and out of the heat,'' <PERSON> Doughty </PERSON> said, `` but not how to give commands in French.

 Troops have seized thousands of weapons since a curfew was imposed nearly two weeks ago to quell ethnic violence in <LOCATION> Uzbekistan </LOCATION>, and the death toll rose with the discovery of two more bodies, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported today. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>, the official news agency, said troops had confiscated 157 firearms and steel weapons as well as 26 firebombs during road checks in the last 24 hours. A total of 7,718 weapons have now been confiscated. Meanwhile the remains of two people were discovered and added to the list of at least 100 victims, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. On Thursday, the agency quoted Premier <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> as saying that at least 100 people had died during the turmoil that began June 3. More than 1,000 buildings have been looted and burned since the brutal rampage against the <PERSON> Meskhi </PERSON> <PERSON> Turk </PERSON> minority began in the <LOCATION> Fergana </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> about 1,500 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, the agency reported. At least 1,500 people have been detained for violating the 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew that went into effect on June 4, the military newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Krasnaya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zvezda </ORGANIZATION> reported. Vice President <PERSON> Anatoly </PERSON> <PERSON> Lukyanov </PERSON> has dispatched two deputies of parliament to prepare a report for the <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nationalities </ORGANIZATION>, which will investigate the tragedy, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said.

He did not identify any group or people he held responsible. At another party meeting Wednesday near <LOCATION> Fergana </LOCATION>, the city hit hardest by the unrest, <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> said party and government officials gave gasoline, transportation and vodka to attackers who killed <PERSON> Meskhi </PERSON> <PERSON> Turks </PERSON>. Uzbek militants have said that unemployment and poor food supplies caused anger that was vented in ethnic violence. The late Soviet dictator <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> forced the <PERSON> Meskhi </PERSON> <PERSON> Turk </PERSON> minority to leave their homeland in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> in 1944 and resettle in <LOCATION> Uzbekistan </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Man Freed From Armed Robbery Charge Because of Facial Blemish</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOUSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A man who was held in jail for three months and lost his job after being charged with armed robbery was cleared because of a small facial blemish. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Witner </PERSON>, 43, was set free Thursday after his lawyer, <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Licata </PERSON>, persuaded authorities that the robber photographed by a surveillance camera had no such blemish. District Court Judge <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Price </PERSON> dismissed the two aggravated robbery charges against <PERSON> Witner </PERSON>, who has a small, reddish mole on his lower right cheek. Assistant District Attorney <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Vinson </PERSON> examined pictures of the man in the robbery videotape and of <PERSON> Witner </PERSON>. He noticed other differences, including different-shaped ears, he said. `` They look very, very similar,'' <PERSON> Vinson </PERSON> said. `` If a mole ever helped a man, it helped him.'' <PERSON> Witner </PERSON> called the experience a nightmare. `` It's a sickening feeling. You tell these people, ` I'm not the person you want.' And they look at you and think you're guilty,''' <PERSON> Witner </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Witner </PERSON> said an officer stopped him for a routine traffic violation in March and told him he was under arrest for aggravated robbery. `` I came unglued,'' he said. <PERSON> Witner </PERSON> said he lost his job because his employer, an asbestos removal company, would n't accept a collect telephone call when he tried to call and explain his situation. He spent 90 days in jail, unable to pay $ 40,000 bond. He said he came down with bronchitis in the jail and his weight dropped from 165 pounds to less than 100 pounds. The CitGo convenience store was robbed in November and December 1988, and the robber was caught on camera. The robberies were shown on a local television program and <LOCATION> Harris </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Detective <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Keen </PERSON> received a tip that the man was <PERSON> Witner </PERSON>. He showed <PERSON> Witner </PERSON>'s picture to the two clerks who had been robbed and they positively identified him, <PERSON> Keen </PERSON> said. It was not known why <PERSON> Witner </PERSON> had not been arrested earlier. <PERSON> Witner </PERSON> said he had an appointment last year to have a doctor remove the mole, but changed his mind. `` I'm glad I did,'' he said. `` It's going to stay where it's at. I've had it since I was born, and I'll have it when I go.''

<HEAD>Four Arrested For Allegedly Holding Woman's Dog</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SPARTANBURG, S.C. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Sheila </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON> knew something was amiss when <PERSON> Bentley </PERSON>, her 5-year-old miniature <LOCATION> Yorkshire </LOCATION> terrier, turned up missing. Ms. <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON> said she knew from the beginning that her dog had not just run away. `` I was just hoping whoever had him would n't mistreat him,'' she said. <PERSON> Ronnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Blackwell </PERSON>, 18, found his neighbor's missing dog and later was arrested with three others and charged with conspiracy to commit extortion. <PERSON> Blackwell </PERSON> allegedly tried to force the owner to up the reward to $ 200 and set up a drop at a gas station. But his intent was n't malicious, officials said. <PERSON> Blackwell </PERSON> told police he had grown fond of the shaggy little dog he said he found near the <LOCATION> Spartanburg </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Library </LOCATION> last week. After inquiring about how much the dog's owner was prepared to pay for its return, he apparently decided to keep the dog. `` He said he had become really attached to the dog and felt if he kept upping the price the lady would just think the dog was n't worth it,'' said Detective <PERSON> Audrey </PERSON> <PERSON> McNair </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Spartanburg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bentley </PERSON> had been missing since June 8. Three days later, Ms. <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON> received a call from a man who said he had the dog and would bring him to her house for the $ 50 reward she had promised on fliers, authorities said. He never arrived. Instead, a woman called three different times Sunday and told Ms. <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON>, `` We have the dog,'' and that the $ 50 reward was not enough, police said. During one phone call, a man said the captors wanted $ 200, according to police. Ms. <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON> agreed to the price, but the dog was not returned. During one of the phone calls Sunday, a woman identified herself as a mother whose son had found the dog and was very attached to him. Ms. <PERSON> McNair </PERSON> said the caller was <PERSON> Blackwell </PERSON>'s girlfriend, <PERSON> Rebecca </PERSON> <PERSON> Entsminger </PERSON>, 18, who was also charged with conspiracy to commit extortion. Ms. <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON>, a 30-year-old hair stylist, said Wednesday she offered to give the callers a puppy the next time she had <PERSON> Bentley </PERSON> bred. But they were not interested, she said. A relative of one of the captors saw a television news report Tuesday about the missing dog and apparently convinced the four to return it, authorities said. They called Ms. <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON> to say they would give <PERSON> Bentley </PERSON> back that night. Ms. <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON> got a call Tuesday night telling her to go to a local gasoline station to get her dog. Ms. <PERSON> McNair </PERSON>, who was at Ms. <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON>' home at the time of the call, rode with her to the station, where three suspects were arrested and the dog was recovered in good condition. Miss <PERSON> Entsminger </PERSON> was later arrested when she came to the police station. Also charged with the misdemeanor conspiracy offense were <PERSON> Blackwell </PERSON>'s sister, <PERSON> Theresa </PERSON> <PERSON> Blackwell </PERSON>, 19, and <PERSON> Kipling </PERSON> <PERSON> Messer </PERSON>, 19. They have been released on a $ 2,000 bond each, Ms. <PERSON> McNair </PERSON> said. Conspiracy to commit extortion carries a maximum penalty of five years in prison or up to a $ 5,000 fine.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Even <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> <PERSON> Downey </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> predicts his confrontational nationally syndicated TV talk show is headed down the tubes. `` It's my guess that it'll be all over in September,'' <PERSON> Downey </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> in today's editions. `` It's a very sad state of affairs.'' <PERSON> Downey </PERSON> said that so far the show has been sold in 22 markets, and needs at least 60 to get renewed. Still, distributor <ORGANIZATION> MCA-TV </ORGANIZATION> insists it has n't decided the show's fate and is still actively selling it for next season, the News reported Whatever went wrong, `` it certainly was n't from a lack of publicity,'' said the man noted for enthusiastically berating guests, including skinheads, feminists and homosexuals. Just two months ago <PERSON> Downey </PERSON> was in the headlines again when he claimed a bunch of neo-Nazis attacked him in a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> bathroom, cut his hair and drew a swastika on his face. Critics charged it was a publicity stunt. The <PERSON> Downey </PERSON> show first aired on the New Jersey-based WWOR-TV in November 1987 and went into national syndication the following May. At its peak it was shown on 72 stations. But recently several stations have either dropped it or moved it into later time slots. `` I feel bad that this will mean the end of this type of talk show,'' <PERSON> Downey </PERSON> said. `` No one will take a chance on it anymore.'' <PERSON> Downey </PERSON> said he wo n't be caught unprepared if the show is canceled. He told the News he's working on a summer special for one of the networks, a Christmas album and night club revues for <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 Subway drivers today mounted their sixth 24-hour strike in two months to back pay demands, creating travel chaos for city commuters. Although more subways were running than during the previous strikes, many commuters were forced to use cars, buses, trains and their feet to get to work. Spokesman <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Shire </PERSON> of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> Underground, which runs the subway system, called the strike `` sheer anarchy at the public's expense. Some bus drivers in south <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> also staged a wildcat walkout. The subway dispute centers on introduction of driver-only trains. Drivers want a $ 99 weekly increase for operating without a guard. Management is offering $ 46 with extra vacation. In another labor dispute, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railwaymen </ORGANIZATION> has called a 24-hour strike by its 75,000 rail workers for Wednesday. It is protesting <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rail </ORGANIZATION>'s refusal to increase its pay offer above 7 percent.

 Reports from interior <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> have been rare since troops cleared student demonstrators from <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> on the night of June 3-4.

 When <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s night of blood and fire had ended, witnesses said police with clubs attacked people gathered at a huge statue of <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Chengdu </LOCATION>, 1,000 miles away, starting riots that spread through the city. Witnesses said a market was destroyed by flames and a row of buses was burned during two days of street battles that began Sunday, June 4. They said up to 30 people were killed, more than half of them students. Official press reports have said 300 police were injured but have not mentioned fatalities. It was one of the most violent episodes outside <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, where soldiers swept into Tiananmen Square the night of June 3-4 to end weeks of student protests for democracy. The government says a few hundred people were killed in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, at least half of them soldiers, but Chinese witnesses and Western intelligence put the civilian death toll at about 3,000. As in the capital, students in <LOCATION> Chengdu </LOCATION> began protesting for democracy in mid-April after the death of former <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Hu </PERSON> <PERSON> Yaobang </PERSON>, who lost his job for being too easy on student protests two years earlier. Their focal point was the white 50-foot statue of <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> <PERSON> Tse-Tung </PERSON>, father of communist <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, in the heart of <LOCATION> Chengdu </LOCATION>, capital of central <LOCATION> Sichuan </LOCATION> province. On that Sunday, police charged in with clubs, arresting 47 students and four workers the official media said were camping out at the statue. Word of the assault spread and 10,000 people gathered at the statue, witnesses said. Reports of the <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> bloodshed also were coming in by telephone and <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION>. Protesters attacked police and were turned back with tear gas and water cannons, the witnesses said. A student reported seeing at least one person killed with a bayonet. Unconfirmed reports said several people were shot dead. `` Many students were beaten with clubs with enlarged ends that leave no marks but scramble your brains,'' said a student at <ORGANIZATION> Sichuan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, a center of the democracy movement. The Sichuan Daily and <LOCATION> Chengdu </LOCATION> Evening News have denied rumors that two women were mutilated with bayonets. That night, protesters set fire to a police booth at the entrance of the People's Market and the flames spread through the entire half-block area. Several city buses also were burned. `` It was a mess,'' said a 20-year-old artist who watched the market burn. `` There were fire trucks and ambulances everywhere.'' There were no reports of injuries or deaths in the fire, which the artist said started soon after midnight. The next day _ Monday, June 5 _ news of the carnage in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> spread and more people went to the statue. Protesters burned more buses and police threw smoke bombs into the crowd, witnesses said. At about 10 p.m., 100 people went on a rampage down People's <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Road </LOCATION> toward the Jinjiang Hotel `` They came by and smashed a stack of beer bottles we had outside,'' said a bartender at the Flying Dragon Beer House. `` Fortunately, they left us alone otherwise.'' The looters smashed windows of the <ORGANIZATION> Chengdu </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Store </ORGANIZATION> and the Minshan Hotel, across the street from the Jinjiang, and overturned a taxi into a pond, witnesses said. Scaling the locked gates of the Jinjiang, about half a dozen stormed the front door. `` They had knives and steel pipes. They kept chasing us to the back of the hotel,'' said a waiter at the Jinjiang's lobby bar. `` They stole beer and cigarettes. They scared the hell out of us.'' When five truckloads of police arrived after half an hour, the raiders scattered. `` None appeared to be students,'' a witness said. `` They were factory workers, thugs and teen-agers, unrelated to the pro-democracy movement or the people-police conflict.'' That night, the People's Movie Theater across from the market was burned down. Shopkeepers across the street from the market were reluctant to talk with foreigners. Several said brusquely that they had closed June 5 for several days, and therefore saw nothing. `` If you're reporters go talk to city officials,'' a restaurant manager said. `` We're just minding our own business.'' Official press reports said police arrested 100 `` hoodlums,'' but there has been no mention of students other than a ban on their activist union. Few students remain on campus because no classes are being held, and some have fled in fear of government reprisals. `` The unrest is basically over,'' said a sophomore studying chemistry at <ORGANIZATION> Sichuan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` I came back because I had to see my professors and do some experiments.'' `` I think the student movement is over, and it wo n't come back in September,'' when classes are likely to resume, said a senior majoring in English. More than 400 American citizens, including dependents of consulate staff members, have left <LOCATION> Sichuan </LOCATION> and surrounding provinces via <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, leaving about 80 in the region, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials say. The consulate issued an advisory saying travel to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> should be avoided. Truckloads of police cruise the streets and authorities are putting pressure on foreign journalists in <LOCATION> Chengdu </LOCATION>, as well as in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>. Police confiscated the passports of two correspondents of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday and had not returned them by Thursday.

<HEAD>Earthquake Hits Part of Alaska; No Serious Damage Reported</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PALMER, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>

 An earthquake struck an area 50 miles west of <LOCATION> Kodiak </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, early today, but only minor damage was reported, the <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tsunami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Warning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> said. The quake, which had a preliminary reading of 5.9 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale, occurred at 2:51 a.m. ADT -LRB- 6:51 a.m. EDT -RRB- and was felt in <LOCATION> Kodiak </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Larsen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Karluk </PERSON> and <PERSON> Akiok </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Alec </PERSON> <PERSON> Medberry </PERSON>, a spokesman for the center. He said there was no danger of a tsunami, or tidal wave. A dispatcher with the <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> State Troopers in <LOCATION> Kodiak </LOCATION> said there were reports from throughout <LOCATION> Kodiak </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> of pictures being knocked off walls, but that no major damage was reported. <PERSON> Medberry </PERSON> said there were reports that some people were knocked out of bed in <LOCATION> Larsen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION> and that dishes were broken and lightbulbs were broken in their sockets. <PERSON> Larsen </PERSON> <PERSON> Bay </PERSON> is a village on the west side of <LOCATION> Kodiak </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>. It is about 375 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION>. The <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale is a measure of ground motion as recorded on seismographs. Every increase of one number means a tenfold increase in magnitude. Thus a reading of 7.5 reflects an earthquake 10 times stronger than one of 6.5. If it hits a heavily populated area an earthquake of 3.5 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale can cause slight damage, 4 can cause moderate damage, 5 considerable damage, and 6 severe damage.

<HEAD>Navajo Chairman Arraigned on Tribal Charges</HEAD>

 The Navajo chairman has pleaded innocent to tribal charges accusing him of violating court orders that barred him from acting as chairman after he was suspended by the <ORGANIZATION> Tribal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON>, facing seven counts of interfering with judicial process, was released on his own recognizance after he appeared Thursday before Window Rock District Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Yazzie </PERSON>, officials said. A July 7 pretrial conference was scheduled, said <PERSON> Duane </PERSON> <PERSON> Beyal </PERSON>, spokesman for interim Chairman <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Haskie </PERSON>. A <ORGANIZATION> Tribal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> majority placed <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> on administrative leave with pay Feb. 17 after <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> hearing testimony indicated <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> accepted kickbacks and gifts from parties doing business with the tribe. <PERSON> Beyal </PERSON> said the charges, filed by tribal Prosecutor <PERSON> Melvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Tso </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>, accuse <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> of failing to comply with court orders stemming from the council's decision. <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> has denied any wrongdoing and contends the council action was illegal under tribal law. However, tribal courts have upheld the council's placement of <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> and Vice Chairman <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> on leave and its appointment of <PERSON> Haskie </PERSON> as interim chairman. <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> specifically is accused of violating a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction issued by <PERSON> Yazzie </PERSON>. The orders prohibited <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> and other tribal officials from entering tribal offices and carrying out their offices' duties. <PERSON> Yazzie </PERSON> also restrained <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON> from using tribal airplanes and resources. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's office in <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> has been conducting a grand jury investigation of tribal finances under <PERSON> MacDonald </PERSON>'s chairmanship, but assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Stooks </PERSON> said the office was not involved in the tribal proceedings <PERSON> Stooks </PERSON> declined to discuss the grand jury investigation.

 The nation's <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> bishops are aiming to tackle a number of lingering controversies, including what their stand should be on AIDS education and how to settle disputes with religion teachers. About 300 cardinals, archbishops and bishops gathered today at <LOCATION> Seton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hall </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orange </LOCATION> for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bishops </ORGANIZATION>, opening the conference with a morning Mass. The meeting ends Monday. Tension has increased over the last few years between the bishops and religion teachers, some of whom have been disciplined for advocating birth control and female priests, and taking other stands that contradict church teachings. `` The doctrinal statement hopes to resolve these types of things without doing too much damage,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Wonderly </PERSON>, spokesman for the bishops conference. `` In recent years there has seemingly been an increase in these types of cases, at least in perception.'' The dispute itself indicates a shift within the church. During a conference in 1968, the bishops specified the right of priests and laymen to disagree with the church in the classroom. But that right has since been questioned and theologians have been punished for doing so. The policy to be considered this weekend would not solve disputes over specific issues, but would establish procedure for settling such arguments. In a widely publicized case, the Rev. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Curran </PERSON> was barred from teaching theology at the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The university's action came after the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> strongly criticized him for his positions on abortion, homosexuality and other matters of sexual ethics. Disputes within the church have not been confined to the bishops and theologians. The bishops themselves were divided over a statement on AIDS issued by the group's 50-member administrative board in December 1987. The AIDS statement insists on the church's teaching that the only sure safeguards against contracting the disease are abstinence from sex before marriage and fidelity within a marriage. But one paragraph said public education programs, directed at people who may reject church standards, could include information about condoms, which most medical experts say can help prevent the disease. Critics charged this paragraph implied approval of condoms, which the church has condemned as a form of birth control. Defenders insist the document did not approve condoms, but said that they were an alternative to halting the spread of the deadly disease. The bishops plan to issue a new report on the topic Saturday. The bishops also are scheduled to vote on a statement calling for a normalization of relations between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurley </PERSON>, spokesman for the <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Archdiocese </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Radical Students Calling For Roh's Fall Battle Riot Police</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Thousands of radical students calling for the overthrow of President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> Tae-woo battled riot police with firebombs, rocks and clubs today in campus protests in four cities, police said. Fighting involving 5,000 students occurred at five campuses in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Taejon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Chonju </LOCATION> after riot police blocked students from marching into the streets, police officials said. Protesters surged out of the campuses to attack police with hundreds of firebombs. `` Punish <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> Tae-woo!'' and `` Down with dictatorship!'' protesters yelled. Police officials said there were numerous minor injuries, but they had no reports of arrests. Student leaders called for the overthrow of <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> and demanded to be allowed to take part in a youth festival next month in communist <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s government has refused to allow the students to take part in the 13th World Youth Festival in <LOCATION> Pyongyang </LOCATION>, the capital of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, on July 1-8. `` March to <LOCATION> Pyongyang </LOCATION>!'' students chanted as they beat drums and waved flags. Peaceful anti-government protests were also held today at many colleges in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> and other cities, but police said they had no figures on how many. The fighting marked the second day of widespread campus clashes in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> and other cities and indicated radical students had abandoned a self-imposed ban on firebombs. Some student groups said they would stop using the weapons after seven riot police were killed in a May 3 campus clash, but other groups continued to use firebombs. The students and allied dissident groups have little public support because of their extremist views and violent tactics. Student leaders who refused to be identified said they had been forced to use firebombs as self-defense against police attacks. But the fighting today all appeared to have been started by students when police blocked the marches. About 2,000 students from at least six colleges battled hundreds of police at <ORGANIZATION> Hankuk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>. Riot police surrounding the school hurled rocks at the protesters but did not use tear gas. Students marched out of the school and attacked riot police blocking the road with wooden clubs and iron bars. Protesters then attacked with firebombs, and several officers were set ablaze. The fires were put out quickly by other troopers. Protesters knocked down parts of the school's wall to make ammunition to hurl at police. Police set up iron barricades in the streets to hold students back during the fighting, which lasted more than an hour. Also today, opposition leader <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Dae-jung </PERSON> demanded that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> apologize for its alleged role in a 1980 pro-democracy civil uprising in the southern city of <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION> that left about 200 people dead. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> is head of the largest opposition group, the <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> likened recent incidents in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> to the 1980 civil uprising in <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION>, the capital city of his home province, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cholla </LOCATION>. One day after <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> and many opposition figures were arrested by martial law authorities on May 17, 1980, student-led demonstrators in <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION> rose up against the government, drove out police and seized control of the city. Tank-led army troops ended the revolt in nine days. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> and many government critics believe the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> acquiesced in the military suppression of the <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION> revolt. They say a South Korean army division under operational control of the top <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> army commander in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> was used to crush the <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION> uprising. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had denied the allegations.

<HEAD>Aoun Threatens to Attack Highways After Shells Hit Tanker</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Christian leader Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> today threatened to attack roads to <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s capital after Syrian shells hit a tanker carrying gasoline to the Christian area. A sailor was missing and presumed dead. `` Roads leading to capitals of occupation -LRB- forces -RRB- will not be safe henceforth,'' the army commander said in a statement broadcast by the state-run radio. `` We shall confront this foreign enemy with the courage of a warrior at the front,'' <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> said. The roads between <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION>, the capital of <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> are vital to <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s 40,000 troops in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, stationed there under a 1976 peacekeeping mandate. Attacking the highways would mark a sharp escalation in the 3-month-old confrontation between <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s mainly Christian army units and an alliance of Syrian and Druse Moslem militiamen. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> did not spell out how he would strike. His artillery has shelled the network of roads, mainly in the Syrian-controlled <LOCATION> Bekaa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> east </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, but he could also use hit-and-run commando raids, land mines or car bombs on the highways. Syrian shells hit the oil tanker late Thursday, and the ship burned out of control through the night. Firefighters brought the blaze under control today, but the 660,000 gallons of badly needed gasoline were lost. A police spokesman, who can not be named under standing regulations, identified the vessel as the <ORGANIZATION> Timex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION>. But <ORGANIZATION> Lloyd </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipping </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unit </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, which monitors shipping around the world, said its agents in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> identified the ship as the 1,507-ton tanker Chemicoral, owned by the <ORGANIZATION> Chemicoral </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Piraeus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>. Officials rescued nine Indian and four <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> sailors who abandoned the burning vessel, but an Indian crewman was missing and presumed dead, said the police spokesman. The Christian enclave suffers from an acute shortage of fuel because the main depots in the east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> neighborhood of <LOCATION> Dora </LOCATION> were devastated by Syrian shellfire March 30. The ship was hit about 500 yards off <LOCATION> Tabarja </LOCATION>, a tiny port 15 miles north of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. Syrian gunners shelled the Christian coastline again today, but no casualties were reported. Syrian and Moslem militia forces have been battling <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s forces in the latest round of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s civil war. The outbreak in fighting, which began March 8, has killed 372 people and wounded 1,450 wounded.

<TEXT>
 Seven employees at an <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> detention center were among those indicted on federal drug charges after a six-month undercover investigation, authorities said. The sealed indictments were returned Tuesday and were ordered unsealed Thursday after all but one had been arrested. The indictments allege that cocaine and marijuana were sold to an undercover agent, Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Crews </PERSON> said. `` The amounts of drugs are relatively small,'' he said. `` What makes it exceptionally significant, to us, however, is that the offenses are alleged to have occurred either at the service processing center or by individuals employed by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. And it's the position of this office that any amount is too much when it comes to that.'' Crews said no detainees were involved in the alleged offenses. In all, nine people were named in the indictments, officials said. Seven had worked either for the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> or a private security company at the <ORGANIZATION> Port </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Isabel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Processing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, where undocumented aliens are detained before deportation, authorities said. The center has a detainee population of about 1,300. Eight suspects appeared Thursday before <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Magistrate <PERSON> Fidencio </PERSON> <PERSON> Garza </PERSON> and each was released on a $ 10,000 unsecured bond. <PERSON> Garza </PERSON> scheduled arraignments for Wednesday. The two employees still working for the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> have been suspended until the matter is resolved, said <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Virginia </PERSON> <PERSON> Kice </PERSON>. She said the <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> initiated the investigation after becoming suspicious of activity at the detention center. Officials said no more indictments are expected in the case, which stemmed from a six-month undercover investigation by the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s Office of Inspector General.

<HEAD>Reagan Says Chinese Demonstrators Not Like Anti-Vietnam War Protesters</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Former President <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said today <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> demonstrators should not be likened to anti-Vietnam war protesters because the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> students are `` trying to get rid of'' the type of government American students wanted to bring to power. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, who was governor of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> during anti-war protests, said the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> played a major role in `` those student uprisings'' against the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> role in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. The former president was interviewed from <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> on <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Good Morning America. Asked why he spoke favorably of the Chinese students but had frowned on the anti-war demonstrations in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> during the 1960s, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said: `` The difference was, if you really look at what they were trying to change, they were trying to bring about ... the things that the young people in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> are now trying to get rid of,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. As governor, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said he had access to police and other intelligence unavailable to the public. `` We knew the role that the American <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> was playing in those student uprisings,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. He said members of the party were involved in both pro-war and anti-war demonstrations `` in order to keep the disturbances going, to make sure that the trouble continued.'' As for the Chinese demonstrators, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said the students might have pushed their goals too fast but he believed they had widespread support, especially among their parents and families. During an ongoing crackdown against the students, the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> government has characterized them as counter-revolutionaries with little popular support. `` You have to believe that those families sided with them,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. `` So they did n't change any of those people's _ the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> people's _ minds about the need for more freedom and more democracy in their system.''

 Chancellor <PERSON> Helmut </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>, euphoric over the recent visit by Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, predicted today there will be an East-West accord on reducing conventional forces in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> within a year. In a parliamentary address recapping the <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> visit, <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> also sharpened his denunciation of the crackdown by Chinese officials on pro-democracy demonstrators, calling it a `` relapse into unmasked suppression.'' <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> and his main political opponents were united in their celebration of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s four-day visit. <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s visit was a `` huge and important success'' that would `` widen the trust between the two nations and governments.'' The chancellor also said he and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> `` were in agreement that the <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> negotiations on -LRB- reducing -RRB- conventional weapons must be carried out with all energy. We decided to remain in close personal contact over this matter.'' <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> said he and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> agreed it is possible to forge an initial agreement on reducing conventional forces within six to 12 months and for its terms to be carried out through 1992 and 1993. At a <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> summit in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> last month, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> announced a major disarmament initiative aimed at producing a conventional forces agreement at the <LOCATION> East-West </LOCATION> negotiations in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> within a year. In his wide-ranging parliamentary speech, <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> again criticized the killing of Chinese students by troops in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> and the arrests resulting from the crackdown on the pro-democracy movement. `` The peaceful protest by thousands of students and workers was strangled by tanks. And now a decreed wave of denunciations and planned arrests has begun,'' <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> said. `` We mourn for the victims with all Chinese in the world and denounce with all friends of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> this relapse into unmasked suppression,'' <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> returned to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> on Thursday after receiving an enthusiastic welcome on every stop of his West German visit. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is the most popular foreign leader among West Germans, who view him as the most important element in a new atmosphere of peace and trust in <LOCATION> East-West </LOCATION> relations. Even <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s opposition Social Democrats, normally at odds with <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>, congratulated the chancellor for his talks with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. A veteran member of the opposition Social Democrats, former Chancellor <PERSON> Willy </PERSON> <PERSON> Brandt </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s trip was `` a success for the federal government, which we applaud.'' <PERSON> Brandt </PERSON> also reminded Parliament that as chancellor he was the architect of the first postwar thaw between <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and the Soviet-led East bloc, which earned him the 1971 Nobel Peace Prize. West German relations with the Soviets slid again in the early 1980s following <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>'s decision to permit the deployment of new <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> missiles.

 A multibillion-dollar plan offering parents both subsidies and tax credits for child care will end the `` tragic choice'' parents face between leaving a child alone while working or accepting welfare, a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> senator said today. Sen. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON> of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> opened the second day of debate on the measure, calling it a `` very fine, very important step toward providing care for children who need it.'' And, <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON> said, the assistance provided in the legislation would eliminate `` the tragic choice many parents face where they either have to be at work and leave their child unattended or stay with their child and be on welfare. We obviously should end that tragic situation.'' Under an agreement between Democrats and Republicans, no votes on proposed amendments will be held before Monday. The proposal faces stiff opposition from the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, which favors an approach dependent almost solely on tax credits. Democrats say they are open to compromise but committed to the principles of the Act for Better Child Care sponsored by Sen. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Conn </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON> agreed to a number of changes in his plan in order to get it to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor Thursday, a significant step in itself given the staunch opposition the package faced earlier this year Opposition stemmed for the most part from two provisions in the original bill, one calling for federal regulation of child care and another that many lawmakers believed would have forced the closing of church-run centers. The revised version leaves regulations to the states, although it would establish federal guidelines for the states to follow if they wished. And it allows for vouchers to be used to pay for child care at church-run centers provided the money is not used `` in a manner inconsistent with the Constitution,'' which mandates separation of church and state. Those changes were drafted with the assistance of a leading <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> senator, <PERSON> Orrin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, who challenged the administration's position that tax credits alone would put a significant dent in the nation's child care problems `` It will not, by itself, encourage family based providers, churches, non-profit organizations or businesses to offer child care services,'' <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON> said. `` There are other factors that discourage choice in child care which can not be addressed simply by giving more money to consumers.'' Also tacked on to the bill was a tax credit package passed by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. It would make the existing dependent care tax credit refundable in advance and also establish a new credit that would give back up to $ 500 to help families with annual incomes of less than $ 21,000 pay for their children's health insurance. Also included in the measure is an amendment unrelated to child care that would delay the implementation of a law requiring business to test their benefit programs for discrimination between lower and higher paid employees. Business interests have been lobbying heavily for the extension and by attaching it to the child care package Democrats hope to increase support among Republicans. But Senate Minority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, R-Kan., made it clear the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> would press its plan, shaped largely by the child care tax credit promised by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> during the campaign `` This is a necessity,'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said. `` It is a high priority with the president. It is a high priority with the administration. But we believe there is a better way to go.'' Seventy-percent of the money $ 1.75 billion proposed to be spent on the <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON> bill would go to parents to help pay for child care, 22 percent would go to training and grant and loan programs designed to improve the quality and supply of child care and 8 percent would go to states to administer programs and enforce standards. The tax-credit portion of the measure would cost the government $ 10.3 billion over five years but includes proposal to offset the loss, including making permanent a 3 percent federal telephone tax scheduled to drop to 2 percent next year.

 Storms that dumped nearly 2 inches of rain forced authorities to close several highways and evacuate homes flooded by muddy creek water in a town that remained cut off from the rest of the state this morning. At least 50 families in <LOCATION> Dunlow </LOCATION> in southwest <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> were evacuated to churches and the fire station, which is on a hill, fire officials said. But by midmorning the floodwaters were already retreating and officials were optimistic the evacuations would not last long. `` We've taken them out in boats and four-wheel-drive vehicles. Rescue people have waded through water over their chests to haul many elderly out of their homes,'' said fire Capt. <PERSON> Reva </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> could not reach the community of about 350 people because `` there's water on both ends and all the way around,'' Fire Chief <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Beckett </PERSON> said. He said officials were unable to assess damage immediately. `` The waters fell about a foot and a half since 5:30 a.m.,'' the fire chief said shortly after 7:30 a.m. `` It came fast and it's going down fast ...

 Businesses shut down as thousands of blacks stayed away from work today to observe a self-declared national holiday on the 13th anniversary of the <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION> township riots. Police reported sporadic violence in several areas. A group of blacks apparently attempting to enforce the work stoppage fatally stabbed a black motorist in <LOCATION> Guguletu </LOCATION>, a township outside <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>, police said. Police used tear gas to disperse 3,000 people who attended a rally at the <ORGANIZATION> Regina </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mundi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION>, the huge township outside <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>. Police also fired tear gas to break up a church service outside <LOCATION> Durban </LOCATION>, witnesses said. Vandals during the night smashed the tombstone of <PERSON> Hector </PERSON> <PERSON> Pieterson </PERSON>, a 13-year-old boy who was the first person killed in 1976 when police fired at students protesting the requirement that they be taught in <LOCATION> Afrikaans </LOCATION>, the language of the white Afrikaners who dominate the government. Friends said the smashed grave marker at Avalon Cemetery in <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION> was discovered when <PERSON> Pieterson </PERSON>'s mother arrived to place flowers on the grave today. Commonly known as `` Soweto Day,'' June 16 has no official status as a holiday. But many businesses closed because so many black workers and customers take the day off. Hundreds of employers have negotiated contracts with workers to make it a paid holiday, while others have adopted a `` no work, no pay, no disciplinary action'' policy on June 16. `` The anniversary must be used not as a weapon in a war of bitterness, but as a repeated catalyst for constructive change,'' The Star, the country's largest daily, said in an editorial. `` Freedom for all remains an unattainable goal unless the government is willing to break away from the basic concepts of apartheid,'' it added. In the major cities of <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Durban </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>, black commuter traffic was less than half the weekday average, according to various estimates. Bus stops, railway stations, and taxi stands were unusually empty. Black schools nationwide were deserted. Buses in <LOCATION> Durban </LOCATION> traveled under police escort to prevent attacks by black militants attempting to enforce the work stoppage. The 1976 <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION> riots spread nationwide and an estimated 700 blacks were killed in the ensuing months, a period that brought a new level of militancy to the anti-apartheid movement. Thousands of blacks fled the country at that time to join the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla movement, the main black group attempting to undermine the white-led government. The country's largest black-oriented daily newspaper, The Sowetan, said Thursday in an editorial: `` Thirteen years ago we went through a bloodbath over the country's education system _ to this day very little has changed.'' Under apartheid, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s 5 million whites exercise political and economic control over 28 million blacks. Whites maintain segregated schools, neighborhoods and hospitals.

<TEXT>
 The governor of this British colony today criticized countries that oppose forcibly repatriating some Vietnamese boat people, saying they are acting illogically and inhumanely. The governor, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, spoke with reporters after returning from an international conference on boat people in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. There, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> opposed calls for forced repatriation of boat people who are not considered refugees. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> support the repatriation. <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> is swamped with about 30,000 boat people. The government says many are not refugees fleeing political persecution but illegal immigrants seeking better economic conditions. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said there are many countries that `` simply will not face facts.'' He said such countries agree there's no question of resettling in third countries people who are not refugees, but at the same time they oppose forcing such people back to <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. `` To my mind that is illogical, and indeed I think it is inhumane because what it is saying is that those people should simply pile up in camps around the region,'' <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said. The head of the relief agency <ORGANIZATION> Oxfam </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Bale </PERSON>, said today there is no alternative to forced repatriation because the Vietnamese `` really do not want to go back.'' Those who are not refugees should be returned just as illegal immigrants from any other country are returned, he said. He said many Vietnamese were suffering psychological problems from being confined in the camps for years. Starting in June 1988, <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> tried to curb the influx by a screening the Vietnamese and separating refugees, who are eligible for resettlement in the West, from other groups who are supposed to return home. Only 143 Vietnamese have gone back voluntarily even though the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> gives financial aid for people to return. The 60-nation conference in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> adopted a plan introducing universal screening programs. The plan called for encouraging voluntary return and said if this did not succeed, alternatives would be examined. Local police in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> today said 105 people found on a wooden boat near a southwestern Japanese island were all Vietnamese who left home in search of a place where they could `` enjoy a higher standard of living.'' The police official, who requested anonymity, said a local Vietnamese woman confirmed the Vietnamese came from <LOCATION> Hon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gai </LOCATION>, a small village along the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tonkin </LOCATION>, near the boarder of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. A local fisherman spotted the old wooden boat near <LOCATION> Hazama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION>, 610 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, early today. If the <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> grants the group refugee status, they will be allowed a 180-day stay in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> until their final destination is determined. That stay can be extended until a permanent residence is found through the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> High Commissioner for Refugees in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>.

 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said today his crime crackdown policies may not be popular with some judges because they fill trial calendars, but he declared they are needed to stop the `` shooting war'' in the streets. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told a White House gathering of about 90 of the nation's 94 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorneys to return to their states and enforce his policy of no plea bargaining with violent, gun-wielding offenders. Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> gave the prosecutors a set of written guidelines regarding plea bargaining for crimes involving firearms. <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> wrote: `` In all but exceptional cases such as those in which the defendant has provided subastantial assistance to the government in the investigation or prosecution of crimes by others, federal prosecutors will seek conviction for any offense involving the unlawful use of a firearm which is readily provable. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told the federal prosecutors they are `` the commanders at the frontlines'' and urged them to help `` put away the nation's most wanted.'' `` The situation in our streets has been aptly compared to a shooting war,'' he said, noting that many in the room might take issue with statements that the country is at peace. The president hammered home his view that criminals who use guns in violent crimes should be prosecuted to the maximum extent. `` This policy may mean more trials. ... firearms cases like narcotics cases, are not always very popular with some on the bench,'' he acknowledged. `` But it can be done, and in fact already is being done, even in districts with these overcrowded dockets ...'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said his proposals for more federal prosecutors, law-enforcement officers and new prison construction will help ease the overburdened criminal justice system. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also emphasized the need cracking down on white collar crime, calling for strict enforcement of laws against financial and banking fraud, organized crime and civil rights violations. `` Crime is crime whether committed with a briefcase or a gun. We will not tolerate greed over honest business,'' he said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Thursday sent <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> the legislative draft of the $ 1.2 billion anti-crime package which he outlined a moth ago. But to dramatize his commitment to fighting drugs and violent crime, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> journeyed to the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Training </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in steamy <LOCATION> Glynco </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, to sign the transmittal document. Most of the money _ $ 1 billion _ would go to expand federal prison capacity, but <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also is intent on hiring 1,600 new prosecutors to work under the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorneys, and 825 new federal agents. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Treasury-run center in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> trains police and investigators from every federal law enforcement agency except the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> and the Drug Enforcement Agency. `` In a country where criminals threaten to erode the very liberties we hold so dear, you are domestic freedom fighters in the war on crime,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told trainees and several thousand others gathered on a 90-degree day for the event. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he has instructed Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>, who accompanied him to <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, `` to advise <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s federal prosecutors to end plea bargaining for violent federal firearms offenses. `` Our message to the common criminal is this: Pack a gun and we'll pack you away,'' he said. He exhorted <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to enact his plan to double the mandatory penalty for use of semi-automatic weapons in drug or violent crimes to 10 years. But earlier, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> advised a graduating <ORGANIZATION> Border </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patrol </ORGANIZATION> officer, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON>, to remember that criminal suspects `` should be treated with respect and given his rights or her rights, even though the evidence looks overwhelming.''

 Republicans today commended GOP National Chairman <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> for his aggressive leadership and said he had been subjected to `` unremitting attacks'' from Democrats. <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> repeated his call for the election of a Cuban-American to succeed the late Rep. <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Pepper </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., a stance termed inflammatory by a Democratic state senator Members of the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> adopted a resolution commending <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>'s leadership and saying it had made him `` the target of unremitting attacks from Democrats and their surrogates.'' In debate on the resolution, <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> London </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> national committeeman from <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, praised what he called <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>'s courage and asked, `` Why do you think the Democrats want to get rid of him?'' <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> pledged that `` every ounce of energy I have is going to be dedicated to doing the best job I can to promote this party.'' <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> said at a meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Cuban-American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Tuesday that he gave priority to the election of a Cuban-American to Pepper's seat. `` I'm saying it again because I believe it,'' <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> committee today. `` I believe there is a place in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for a Cuban-American and if the Democrats do n't like that, fine ... they can keep attacking me and keep attacking me and keep attacking me.'' On Thursday, a Democratic state senator, <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON>, withdrew from the race to succeed Pepper and attacked <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>'s call for the election of a Cuban-American. `` No statement would more inflame a city that has more tension and antagonism than it can possibly deal with right now,'' <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> said, calling <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>'s statement `` outrageous'' and `` irresponsible.'' <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>, however, said, `` I think it would be great if we could elect a Cuban-American to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, and this party is dedicated to doing that.'' <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> made no mention of the controversial memo sent out from the <ORGANIZATION> RNC </ORGANIZATION> office earlier this month attacking the voting record of Speaker of the House <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>. The resolution commending him also made no direct mention of the memo. Most committee members and state <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> chairmen interviewed as they opened the two-day meeting predicted <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> would ride out the controversy generated by the memo comparing the new House speaker's voting record to that of Rep. <PERSON> Barney </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> Critics of the memo say it was unfair because it was headed `` <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>: Out of the Liberal Closet'' and <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> Democrat, is an acknowledged homosexual. An Atwater aide, <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodin </PERSON>, resigned after saying he had approved the memo. Democrats have called on President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to fire <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>, but the president has said he accepts the chairman's statement that the memo was written and mailed without his knowledge <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Devine </PERSON>, chairman of the conservative political action group <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, told reporters at Thursday's session, `` I would say he -LRB- Atwater -RRB- is home safe.'' `` He may take a low profile but his real talent is organizing and setting plans, and for that he does n't need to be on the front page,'' <PERSON> Devine </PERSON> said. `` I would be personally upset if he did not stay on as chairman.'' <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> State Republican Chairman <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON> <PERSON> Abraham </PERSON> said he did not believe the distribution of the memo would cause continuing problems for <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>. `` I think everybody agrees it was inappropriate and I think the proper actions were taken and <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodin </PERSON> resigned and that's the end of it,'' the <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> chairman said. However, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenbaum </PERSON>, the national committeeman from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said, `` I find what happened to be very embarrassing and regrettable.'' Asked if the incident would be crippling to <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>, <PERSON> Rosenbaum </PERSON> said: `` I do n't know. It's still a little early to get a real consensus.'' <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON>, the Republican chairwoman in <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>'s home state of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said she had received `` very few calls'' about the memo. `` It was a very unfortunate thing, but I think it turned into a media issue and a Democratic issue,'' Ms. <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON> said.

 A private escrow agent nicknamed `` <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> HUD'' told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> today she considers her diversion of millions of dollars from government housing programs `` sin'' and intends to repay the money. And the inspector general at the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> said accountability problems in the agency that permitted such schemes still exist. `` I, in no way, justify what I have done as being anything less than sin,'' <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Harrell </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on housing and employment, adding that she expected `` no leniency or immunity from prosecution.'' `` Allow me to state, for the record, that I do _ regardless of where my life takes me from here _ intend to repay in full all monies taken,'' she said. <PERSON> Harrell </PERSON>, who has admitted to investigators that she did not forward at least $ 5.5 million to the federal housing agency, repeated claims that she donated much of the money to charitable projects to provide housing for the poor. `` What was spent over and above what we needed to run the company was directed legitimately to help the poor and homeless and assist those ministries that did the same,'' she said. `` HUD has not established effective monitoring systems to assure that closing agents properly carry out their responsibilities,'' said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, inspector general at the department. `` Moreover, planned changes to its automated systems have been slow, and current systems do not contain all information field offices need to properly monitor agent activities,'' he added. `` I would be surprised if this would be the end of the revelations,'' said subcommittee chairman <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON>, D-Calif. Last week four senior <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> employees in the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, field office were placed on administrative leave after <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> investigators found escrow agents may have embezzled as much as $ 10 million through the program without being noticed <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> authorities also want to question <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, an attorney who has been missing for about a year about the disappearance of another $ 3 million. Another agent has been indicted by a federal grand jury in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, on charges of stealing $ 2.5 million from the sales of 55 homes in the <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> area. `` It appears that <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> monitored these settlement agents with the same vigilance <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> used in watching over the skippers of its tankers,'' said <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON>, comparing former <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>'s tenure at the agency to the recent <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> oil spill. <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> reportedly has ordered all 53 field offices to conduct reviews and give an accounting for all proceeds from the sales of the agency's property. On Thursday, Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> also ordered federal prosecutors to examine the property-sales programs for evidence of criminal fraud and embezzlement. <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> already is reeling from allegations of mismanagement, favoritism and influence-peddling in the administration of a rehabilitation program to renovate housing for the nation's poor. <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON> decided to proceed with hearings on the property-sales program despite <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>' objections they might endanger the agency's probe `` I rarely find that it jeopardizes an investigation, particularly if you're not granting use immunity,'' said subcommittee member <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Shays </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Conn </LOCATION>. `` The more we investigate the more we uncover It just does n't seem to end.

 Editorials in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s official media in the past few days indicate the leadership wants to turn the public against people the authorities have branded counterrevolutionaries. `` A gang of political hoodlums, the evil remnants of the Gang of Four and other dregs of society,'' is how the People's Daily described students and supporters, now condemned for seeking greater political freedoms. The Gang of Four were the radical leaders of the 1966-76 violent far-left Cultural Revolution. One of the four, <PERSON> Yao </PERSON> <PERSON> Wenyuan </PERSON>, was a former journalist who became known for the kind of vitriolic editorials that have appeared three straight days on the front page of the People's Daily, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> paper. Some Chinese said privately that the recent string of editorials were not up to the standard of <PERSON> Yao </PERSON> and other Cultural Revolution propagandists, who condemned so-called class enemies with a wide range of epithets including `` cow demon and snake spirit.'' But today's editorial called the protesters an `` ideological pimple'' and said the words of senior leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON>, who ordered the crackdown, were `` the most powerful ideological weapon for lancing -LRB- it -RRB-.'' Biting language also was used to condemn two American reporters who were ordered out of the country. The Economic Daily called <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Pomfret </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Pessin </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> `` gods of plague'' who took advantage of and stirred up `` naive, pure and innocent'' students. `` They spread the plague to <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>, to all of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and the whole world. It is time to sterilize it,'' the paper said. The name-calling reflected traditional emphasis on names and labels, but also an urgent drive to convince anyone still in doubt about the correctness of the crackdown. Several editorials played on fears of a return to past turmoil. `` If -LRB- the protesters' -RRB- plot had succeeded, greater turmoil and division would have occurred nationwide and the people's republic that was paid for with the lives of countless martyrs would have been destroyed in a single day,'' the People's Daily fumed Thursday, `` and the whole nation would have been enveloped in a ` white terror.''' `` White terror'' was a reference to Nationalist executions and imprisonments of communist underground workers during the civil war in the 1930's and'40s. `` If we show weakness or turn backward in the face of capitalist attack ... the achievements of 40 years of socialism would be wiped out in a single day and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> would once again become a dependency of imperialism,'' said today's editorial. `` Some comrades have n't opened up their minds and are still confused about certain issues,'' it said. `` Abroad there is anti-Chinese and anti-Communist clamor, and in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> there is a market for every kind of rumor.'' For these comrades, <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> television continued its expanded nightly news report, double the usual 15 minutes, while the usual 30-minute national news ran more than an hour. Most of the television reports have shown arrests of protesters, visits by top officials to soldiers enforcing martial law, and workers gathered to study <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>'s recent speech applauding the crackdown. In one report, a group of workers in hardhats clapped hands and sang the children's song, `` Without the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, there would be no new <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>.'' Most newspapers have been published with only four pages instead of their usual eight for the past week because of a shortage of newsprint caused by martial law-related disruptions in transportation. But almost all the space has been taken up by stories related to the crackdown.

 An explosion Friday at a gas station injured 15 people and started a fire that destroyed more than 45 cars in a parking garage, police said. Station owner <PERSON> Dimitris </PERSON> <PERSON> Asvestas </PERSON> ran from the station engulfed in flames after the blast, a witness said, and he was listed in critical condition at a hospital with third-degree burns. Flying debris injured 14 others, two of them seriously. The blast ignited a fire that swept through a parking garage beneath a seven-story office building, destroying the cars, police said. The cars' exploding gas tanks kept firefighters from entering the garage for more than an hour. Police said they do n't know what caused the explosion.

<TEXT>
 A federal appeals court has ruled that <ORGANIZATION> MCI </ORGANIZATION> forfeited its opportunity to have a multibillion-dollar federal telecommunications contract reopened because it failed to bid the first time. `` MCI did not act on time to become an interested party with regard to the solicitation,'' the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> for the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday. `` <ORGANIZATION> MCI </ORGANIZATION>'s argument that it is an interested party must be rejected.'' Last December 7, the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> awarded the contract for one network to <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T and for the other to <LOCATION> US </LOCATION> Sprint. Losing out was a third bidder, <ORGANIZATION> Martin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marietta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corporation </ORGANIZATION>, whose proposal included a substantial share for <ORGANIZATION> MCI </ORGANIZATION>. The contracts for the two networks are among the largest non-military awards by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Government. They are valued at between $ 3 billion and $ 10 billion, and they could reach a maximum $ 25 billion over their 10-year life. <ORGANIZATION> MCI </ORGANIZATION> went before the <ORGANIZATION> GSA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Contract </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> to challenge the award to <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T, complaining that <ORGANIZATION> GSA </ORGANIZATION>, after awarding the contract, impermissibly waived requirements instead of resoliciting the contract. The board rejected the claim in February, saying that <ORGANIZATION> MCI </ORGANIZATION> _ which was to have been a major subcontractor for <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Marietta </PERSON> _ was not an interested party. <ORGANIZATION> MCI </ORGANIZATION> had claimed that if the contract were resolicited it would be a `` prospective bidder'' but the board rejected that also. <ORGANIZATION> MCI </ORGANIZATION> carried the case to the appeals court. That court agreed with the government that the laws involved do not provide for a prospective bidder after the time has passed for submitting proposals. `` <ORGANIZATION> MCI </ORGANIZATION>'s stated intention to submit a proposal in response to any resolicitation, and its efforts to secure resolicitation by filing a protest, can do nothing to creat the necessary interested party status,'' said the court. `` By the close of the proposal period, <ORGANIZATION> MCI </ORGANIZATION> had placed itself outside the boundaries of interested party status ... Nothing later proven could alter the fact that <ORGANIZATION> MCI </ORGANIZATION> did not act on time to become an interested party with regard to the solicitation.'' And, said the court, `` nothing alters the fact that <ORGANIZATION> MCI </ORGANIZATION> was not an actual or prospective bidder and, therefore, is not an interested party.''

 An army general told Western reporters today that soldiers of the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> fired on unarmed civilians in <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>, then he contradicted himself and denied troops shot at the protesters. In the government's first news conference for Western reporters since it began cracking down on the movement for democracy, Gen. <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Zhiyun </PERSON> said troops were forced to use violence to enter the city because `` people who did n't know the truth'' blocked them on the outskirts of <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Li </PERSON> said soldiers in tanks and armored personnel carriers later `` exercised restraint'' while clearing student-led demonstrators from Tiananmen June 3-4. `` But still there were some thugs, they -LRB- were -RRB- still provocative to the troops. At this time, some of the soldiers in our troops directed their fire into the square and especially those troops that have wounded or dead soldiers within their troops,'' the army spokesman said. `` The rest of the soldiers started to fire on those thugs who were provocative to them.'' But at another point during the news conference inside the Great Hall of the People, <PERSON> Le </PERSON> said of the deaths: `` It is not from any instances from the soldiers directing their guns at the people. This incident -LRB- soldiers firing on citizens -RRB- never happened within the area of <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Li </PERSON> did not clarify the contradiction. No news agency reporters were allowed to attend the news conference or join a subsequent tour of Tiananmen Square. Associated Press reporters viewed a videotape by <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> television that showed <PERSON> Li </PERSON> speaking in Chinese and another army official translating his remarks. The government previously denied firing a single shot inside Tiananmen Square, but has not commented on shooting elsewhere in the city. Some of the heaviest fighting was a mile away, where civilians threw firebombs at tanks rolling through barricades erected by people trying to protect the students. The military-sponsored tour of <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> gave selected foreign reporters their first look at the vast plaza since the military moved to crush the pro-democracy demonstrations there. Reporters who were in the square the night of the crackdown said there appeared to be less firing there than in other parts of the city, possibly because the army was trying to avoid scarring it. There were reports in the <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> media that tanks rolled over tents in which students were sleeping, and that soldiers later burned the bodies. However, Western reporters said they only saw tanks roll over piles of bedding, but were not sure if people were crushed. All Western reporters fled the square shortly before dawn, after the army had begun moving into it. The government says variously that 200 to 300 people died June 3-4, and that most of those killed were soldiers. Unofficial Chinese and Western intelligence reports say troops fired on unarmed crowds, killing up to 3,000 people. <PERSON> Li </PERSON> said snipers on buildings on the edge of the square opened fire on soldiers. `` In the process of clearing up the blockade -LRB- on the square -RRB-, some of the thugs, they throw bricks and stones onto the soldiers and they use sticks to beat up soldiers. Sometimes there were gunshots from the high buildings. `` Some of the soldiers were beaten until they fainted, and even some were beaten until death,'' <PERSON> Li </PERSON> said. Reporters saw soldiers firing indiscriminately at crowds as the troops moved toward the square. Students had occupied the 100-acre square for several weeks before the crackdown. Tiananmen is in the center of <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> and is the symbolic heart of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. On one side stands the former <ORGANIZATION> Imperial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palace </ORGANIZATION>; on another is the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hall </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> the </LOCATION> <LOCATION> People </LOCATION>, the current seat of government. <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> television said the cleanup at the square had been completed, but it did not say when it would be reopened to the public. Authorities opened the streets around the square on Tuesday.

 The prosecutor in the perjury trial of <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> told jurors today that the former congressman got deeply involved in negotiations for an illegal money deal and lied repeatedly about it to a federal grand jury. But <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON>'s attorneys argued that, throughout his grand jury testimony, he acknowledged the very matters he is charged with trying to conceal. And they accused the government of vindictive prosecution. In his closing statement at the 4-week-old trial, prosecutor <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Gillen </PERSON> detailed for the jury the nine perjury counts against <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON>. The two-term <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> lost his congressional seat in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>'s eastern suburbs to Democrat <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> last November. <PERSON> Gillen </PERSON> began by citing <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON>'s testimony that he was `` never satisfied with respect to criminality'' of the proposed money deal. But the prosecutor said after <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> was told to his face that the money he was seeking was the product of narcotics trafficking, `` What does the former representative from the <LOCATION> Fourth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> have to say? ... He says, ` I can assure you that anything you tell me is in total confidence.''' The undercover agent at that meeting was `` telling this to a citizen, a lawyer, a <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> congressman. Did <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> know it was illegal? He sure did,'' said <PERSON> Gillen </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gillen </PERSON> also slammed <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> for telling the grand jury he did n't recall being told narcotics dollars were involved, even though tapes played for the jury showed that statement was made to him three times at a posh <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> resort `` Do you think you would remember,'' <PERSON> Gillen </PERSON> asked the jury, `` if you took a walk with a man you believed to be a criminal at one of the ritziest resorts in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>? He tells you narcotics dollars are involved ... and what he does violates currency laws. Do you think you would remember? Do you think you could ever forget?'' In a closing statement for the defense, attorney <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Thrash </PERSON> charged that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's office was `` trying to add a former congressman to the trophy case. Truth, justice, fairness is all thrown out the window in their desperation to convict Mr. <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON>.'' Thrash discussed each of the counts in the indictment, as <PERSON> Gillen </PERSON> had, but he pointed to numerous times during the grand jury testimony when <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> acknowledged details that he elsewhere said he could not recall. He urged the jury to look at <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON>'s testimony in its entirety and ask themselves, `` Did he have a specific intent to lie? ... You've got to believe that he did not. He would not have said what he said if it was his intent to deceive the grand jury.'' Another defense attorney, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Hendrix </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> was tired on the day of his grand jury testimony and that the former congressman's attorney had tried to get the testimony delayed because of <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON>'s condition. He said <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> `` did the best he could.'' The judge was to instruct the jurors after a lunch break, and they could get the case as early as this afternoon. One juror was excused this morning and will be replaced by an alternate after he reported that a friend had approached him to talk about the case. <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> is charged with nine counts of perjury in his Feb. 2, 1988, testimony to a federal grand jury investigating his dealings with undercover agent <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Mullaney </PERSON>, posing as a drug-money launderer, and with <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> associate <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> LeChasney </PERSON>, later convicted of money laundering and awaiting sentence. <PERSON> LeChasney </PERSON> cooperated with prosecutors in <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON>'s case. <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON>, 38, faces 10 months to five years in prison on each of the nine counts. Under federal sentencing guidelines which apply to the case, a conviction brings prison time. He negotiated over a period of one month in August and September 1987, seeking $ 850,000 from the undercover agent's sources for construction work on the then-congressman's luxurious suburban home. The money was to go to <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> through a mortgage company set up by <PERSON> LeChasney </PERSON>, according to testimony.

<TEXT>
 A man who escaped from prisons in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> was captured today near <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>, police said. <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> Merrill </PERSON>, 42, was arrested in <LOCATION> Brampton </LOCATION>, 20 miles north of <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>, after officers responding to a report of a break-in at a house found him nearby, said police Sgt. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>. The officers struggled with <PERSON> Merrill </PERSON> during the capture, and police confiscated a knife, <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Merrill </PERSON> was being held at police headquarters. The capture ended an intensive manhunt that began May 31 when <PERSON> Merrill </PERSON> broke out of <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>'s Don jail, apparently by scaling a barbed-wire fence, running across a roof and climbing down a drain pipe 50 feet to the ground. He had been awaiting sentencing on five charges, including sexually assaulting a 15-year-old girl and beating another woman. He had also been convicted of several burglaries in the <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> area and was facing three life sentences. The May 31 escape was the fourth time <PERSON> Merrill </PERSON> had broken out of jail since 1967. The three earlier escapes were from <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> prisons. <PERSON> Merrill </PERSON> fled the <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> jail by climbing a fence around a roof-top exercise yard and sliding down a drainpipe. He disappeared into <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>'s wooded <LOCATION> Don </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>. Police initially followed a trail of blood from the exercise yard after <PERSON> Merrill </PERSON> cut himself on wire atop the 9-foot-high fence he scaled. Police say <PERSON> Merrill </PERSON> came to <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> in 1987 after escaping from <ORGANIZATION> Somers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prison </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>. He had been awaiting trial for the 1987 rape and beating of a <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Windsor </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, woman when he escaped on Aug. 23, 1987. <PERSON> Merrill </PERSON> used assumed names and eluded capture for 13 months before being arrested in an apple orchard in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brunswick </LOCATION> on Sept. 23, 1988. Royal Canadian Mounted Police got a tip from a viewer of the program <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s Most Wanted that <PERSON> Merrill </PERSON> was working as an apple picker. <PERSON> Merrill </PERSON> first escaped from prison on Christmas Day 1967, when he had 37 days left to serve on a sentence of two-to-nine years for a larceny conviction. After placing a dummy in his bed at the old state prison farm in <LOCATION> Enfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, he climbed a fence and headed for his mother's <LOCATION> Tolland </LOCATION> home. <PERSON> Merrill </PERSON> made his second escape in 1968. <PERSON> Gladys </PERSON> <PERSON> Merrill </PERSON> delivered her son a Christmas package of a jar of peanut butter. Hidden inside was a handcuff key, money and a small handgun. On Dec. 19, 1968, <PERSON> Merrill </PERSON> pulled the gun and commandeered a car from three guards. He met his mother at a motel in <LOCATION> Manchester </LOCATION>, but 35 minutes later they were stopped at a roadblock.

<HEAD>The Throwaway Society Gets a Magazine of Its Own</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE FEINSILBER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A new magazine, called Garbage, is coming along to worry about the ecology of diapers and whether the gasoline you burn driving to the recycling center does more damage to the environment than recycling the old newspapers will do good. It is intended for people like its editor-publisher, <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Poore </PERSON>, who says she worries about how much she throws away. `` I think,'' says Ms. <PERSON> Poore </PERSON>, `` we all feel vaguely uneasy and vaguely guilty when you bring the groceries home and realize that 60 percent of what you've bought is packaging.'' She thinks there are plenty of potential readers who worry about what the throwaway society is doing to the quality of life _ to use two buzzwords of the environmental movement. The magazine's full name is Garbage: The Practical Journal for the Environment. It will start publishing in August. Ms. <PERSON> Poore </PERSON> promises the magazine will look at both sides _ the downside as well as the benefits of environmental actions _ despite its basic bias. `` You have to be pro-environment if you want any quality of life and possibly if you want any life at all,'' she says. When an environmentally sound way of doing things turns out to be more costly or more inconvenient, Garbage wo n't whitewash that fact, Ms. <PERSON> Poore </PERSON> says. `` There often is no easy solution.'' To show the conflicts that can arise even among those who want to do the environmentally correct thing, <PERSON> Ms. </PERSON> <PERSON> Poore </PERSON> points to her own quandry over whether to print the magazine on recycled paper. The answer may seem obvious, Ms. <PERSON> Poore </PERSON> says, but it was not easy. `` The editor in me wanted recycled paper,'' she says. `` The publisher in me did n't. `` Recycled paper looks like whole wheat,'' she says, in her publisher's pose. `` It has gooky things in it. They say it will break on the press. `` The publisher in me said there was nothing wrong with premium paper. And the printer told us they would charge 30 percent more to print it on recycled paper!'' But the art director and the managing editor confronted her and said she would be a hypocrite to use virgin paper. And the printer, in environmentally conscience <LOCATION> Burlington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vt. </LOCATION>, relented and promised to charge no extra for the first three issues and see how things come out. Further research found `` cross-pointe troy book paper,'' a recycled paper that `` is very white, and film coated and is easily recyclable itself,'' Ms. <PERSON> Poore </PERSON> says, so the environment -LRB- and the editor -RRB- won the battle, for the moment. <PERSON> Ms. </PERSON> <PERSON> Poore </PERSON> is the owner and publisher of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Old-House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION>. It was a neighborhood paper for owners of brownstones in <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION> when she bought it 11 years ago, just as the preservation movement was catching on. It now has a circulation `` approaching 165,000.'' Garbage, she says, will be the only environmental magazine that is not issued by activists and thus free `` to take the moderator point of view and to have a sense of humor. If you're the <ORGANIZATION> Sierra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, you've got to take a worst-case view, and a sense of humor is a dangerous thing to have.'' The pros and cons of biodegradable diapers will be examined in the first issue. The pro is that they self-destruct while the con is that they introduce human waste into landfills and possibly water tables. The magazine's conclusion: cloth diapers are better.

 A federal appeals court today approved <ORGANIZATION> A.H. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Robins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s bankruptcy reorganization plan, which will create a $ 2.5 billion fund to cover claims against its ill-fated Dalkon Shield birth control device. The plan also calls for the acquisition of <ORGANIZATION> Robins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> by </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> in a $ 700 million stock-swap deal. American Home had the option of backing out of the deal if appeals in the case were not settled by next month. `` We are extremely gratified ... that our legal position has been upheld on all accounts,'' said <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Drebsky </PERSON>, a Robins attorney. In a series of four unanimous opinions, a three-judge panel of the 4th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> upheld the entire scope of the reorganization. The ruling includes a one claimant-one vote plan by which women injured by the intrauterine device ratified the settlement, and a separate cash settlement by <PERSON> Robins </PERSON>' insurance company. `` I think it's just tremendous news for all <ORGANIZATION> Dalkon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shield </ORGANIZATION> claimants,'' added <PERSON> Guerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornton </PERSON>, attorney for the <ORGANIZATION> Dalkon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shield </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Victims </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. `` It means the decade wait for fair treatment and vindication of their rights is almost over.'' <PERSON> Robins </PERSON> sought protection from its creditors in August 1985 in the face of millions of dollars in lawsuits brought by women who said they suffered injuries ranging from infections, sterility and miscarriage to children with birth defects caused by the Dalkon Shield. The Richmond-based pharmaceutical manufacturer's reorganization plan was approved in July 1988 by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Merhige </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Bankruptcy Judge <PERSON> Blackwell </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shelley </PERSON>, who jointly presided over numerous court proceedings. The reorganization plan created a $ 2.5 billion trust fund to compensate about 200,000 women with injury claims against the <ORGANIZATION> Dalkon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shield </ORGANIZATION>, which was sold by the company in the early 1970s. An appeal argued before the 4th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> in December challenged the way the court determined that users of of the intrauterine device had approved the reorganization. More than 95 percent of claimants who returned ballots to the bankruptcy court voted in favor of the plan. But <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON>, a lawyer for the <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citizen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Litigation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said the votes should have been weighted so that women with larger claims would have a greater voice in deciding the issue. He also said claimants should not have been barred by the reorganization plan from filing third-party lawsuits to seek damages from <PERSON> Robins </PERSON>' officers or its insurer. <ORGANIZATION> Aetna </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Casualty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Surety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Robins </PERSON>' insurer, paid $ 425 million to the trust to settle any claims against it. <PERSON> Merhige </PERSON> and <PERSON> Shelley </PERSON> tried to come up with a weighted voting plan but could find no way to estimate each claim in advance, said <PERSON> Robins </PERSON>' attorney <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>. Based on expert testimony, $ 2.5 billion was the estimated cost of full compensation for all <ORGANIZATION> Dalkon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shield </ORGANIZATION> claimants, <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> said. Only $ 100 million of the $ 2.5 billion compensation package to <ORGANIZATION> Dalkon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shield </ORGANIZATION> claimants has been available during the appeal. <PERSON> Robins </PERSON> pulled the IUD off the market in 1974 after about 4.5 million of the devices had been distributed in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and abroad. Before entering bankruptcy proceedings, <PERSON> Robins </PERSON> settled 9,400 of approximately 15,000 <ORGANIZATION> Dalkon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shield </ORGANIZATION> lawsuits with payments of about $ 520 million.

 Hundreds of thousands of people attended a reburial ceremony today for <PERSON> Imre </PERSON> <PERSON> Nagy </PERSON>, the leader of the 1956 anti-Soviet revolt who was executed and buried in an unmarked grave. The ceremony for <PERSON> Nagy </PERSON> and four colleagues in Heroes' Square amounted to a catharsis for <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and mirrored remarkably swift political changes. For example, the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which is following the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s lead in adopting political reforms, began talks this week with opposition leaders on holding multiparty elections. After the ceremony in the square, a motorcade took the coffins to Rakoskert Cemetery in suburban <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Nagy </PERSON> and the others were dumped in unmarked graves after their executions in 1958. The five were reburied today in marked graves on the same spot, known simply as Plot 301. `` We see this day as a dividing line, which we hope will mean we can begin to build a new and free <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Andras </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaplar </PERSON>, a member of the opposition Hungarian Democratic Forum. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> praised the reburial. `` We see the rehabilitation'' of <PERSON> Nagy </PERSON> `` as part of a larger process, that of <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> coming to grips with the truth of its past,'' said spokeswoman <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON>. `` This was an important day in <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and one that was necessary as the country moves further along the path of freedom toward democracy.'' Mourners filled the square and filed past the coffins, where 650 wreaths from across <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> were piled up. Many people came to today's ceremony bearing flowers and wearing lapel pins with portraits of <PERSON> Nagy </PERSON> or the national colors. A sixth, empty coffin lay beside the five others. It symbolized all those who were killed by Soviet tanks and troops that crushed the revolt and by later reprisals. The names and biographies of 250 young Hungarians executed after the revolt were solemnly read. The mourners, estimated by Hungarian television at 250,000 people, included many of <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s leading intellectuals, hundreds of former prisoners in Stalinist camps, and onetime leaders of the failed revolt for a free <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. `` This day marks the change of an era,'' said <PERSON> Imre </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecs </PERSON>, who was sentenced to death after the uprising, in a speech for delivery at the ceremony. `` We are burying a regime that was bad from the start, which was rejected by the nation, which was forced upon us, and which has proven bankrupt in every regard,'' <PERSON> Mecs </PERSON> said. He was released from jail in 1963 after his death sentence was commuted. A delegation of the communist-led government headed by Premier <PERSON> Miklos </PERSON> <PERSON> Nemeth </PERSON> was among those paying their respects. Italian Socialist leader <PERSON> Bettino </PERSON> <PERSON> Craxi </PERSON>, <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON> and diplomats from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and almost all other nations with embassies in <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> attended the ceremony. Hungarian television began all-day broadcasting of the elaborate ceremonies. Black flags hung from many buildings in the capital. <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s neighbors also recalled the events of 1956. Austrian television planned a live broadcast of much of the ceremony. The Charter 77 human rights group in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> sent a message honoring <PERSON> Nagy </PERSON> as `` a symbol of the struggle for freedom, democracy and embodiment of universal values, which also guide us in our struggle for social rebirth.'' However, <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Albania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> declined to send diplomats to the reburial. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, in the throes of its own crackdown, also did not send a representative. In the weeks preceding the reburial, the government and the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> gave startling reassessments of <PERSON> Nagy </PERSON>, who was executed in 1958 on trumped-up charges of high treason. Reburied along with <PERSON> Nagy </PERSON> were his defense minister, <PERSON> Pal </PERSON> <PERSON> Maleter </PERSON>; his minister of state, <PERSON> Geza </PERSON> <PERSON> Losonczy </PERSON>; the head of his secretariat, <PERSON> Jozsef </PERSON> <PERSON> Szilagyi </PERSON>, and journalist and close <PERSON> Nagy </PERSON> associate <PERSON> Miklos </PERSON> <PERSON> Gimes </PERSON>. In a de facto rehabilitation, the government hailed <PERSON> Nagy </PERSON> as an `` outstanding statesman'' this week and the party said he had become a symbol of communist reform policies. Hundreds of exiled survivors of 1956 returned to <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> for the funeral, many for the first time. <PERSON> Bela </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiraly </PERSON>, who was No. 2 in the military in <PERSON> Nagy </PERSON>'s short-lived government, said: `` The Stalinists forced Bolshevik ideas and the Soviet system upon the Hungarians. They forged shackles out of ideology and put the Hungarian nation into irons.'' Now living in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, he returned home for the first time in 33 years to attend the funeral. Speaking for the independent Hungarian youth organization <ORGANIZATION> FIDESZ </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Viktor </PERSON> <PERSON> Orban </PERSON> drew applause when he call for the Soviets to withdraw their troops from <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. `` If we muster enough courage, then we can put an end to communist dictatorship,'' he added. This week the party began talks with opposition leaders on multiparty elections, a goal of the 1956 revolt. Until last February, when the party leadership conceded that a popular uprising began the revolt of 1956, the party had called the events a counterrevolution. The revolt grew out of popular revulsion toward the Stalinist regime of <LOCATION> Matyas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rakosi </LOCATION>. It began on Oct. 23, 1956, with mass demonstrations for a new government and more democracy, which led to <PERSON> Nagy </PERSON>'s rise to power. Soviet tanks and troops moved into <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION> on Nov. 4, 1956, to end the uprising.

Today, authorities in <LOCATION> Chengdu </LOCATION> ordered them to leave within 24 hours and told them their passports would be returned at the airport, the network said.

 Bank robbers wounded a police officer today and briefly held another hostage in a siege and shootout in which one suspect was killed and two may have escaped, authorities said. The four-hour drama ended shortly before 11 a.m., when a helicopter dropped SWAT team members onto the roof of <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and a search of the building turned up no suspects, said Police Chief <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Fox </PERSON>. `` We have one suspect in custody,'' <PERSON> Fox </PERSON> said. `` There currently may be two more suspects at large.'' They could have escaped during the shootout, and one may have been wounded, police said. As officers surrounded the bank for what they assumed was a standoff with robbers inside, one suspect's body lay outside. When the incident ended, police confirmed he was dead, but did not release his identity. The robbers were discovered just before 7 a.m. when a silent alarm summoned police to the bank, <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said. The first policeman to arrive, <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connel </PERSON>, encountered a robber dressed as a bank guard. `` Of course, the officer thought he was a security guard,'' <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said. `` He went into the bank and was confronted with a handgun. The gun was pointed at his head. He was disarmed and tied up.'' That officer was followed by police Lt. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Miles </PERSON>, who exchanged shots with the suspects and suffered minor wounds that would have been more serious except for his bulletproof vest, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said. `` The officer who had been held hostage broke away and as he went out of the bank, exchanged shots,'' <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said. Four bank employees were taken out a side door by police. Police arrested one man outside the bank, and called for a Spanish translator to mediate between authorities and the person or persons they believed were inside the bank, <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said.

 Housing construction fell 2.1 percent in May to the lowest level since the last recession in 1982, the government reported Friday, but analysts said declining interest rates will turn the industry around in coming months. Mortgage rates peaked at 11.22 percent in March and fell to 10.2 percent by last week, causing many analysts to anticipate a jump in housing construction last month. But after the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> on Friday reported a decline in housing activity in May, economists said the drop in rates had come too late to help last month, but predicted improvement in months ahead. `` It seems to us that the drop in interest rates occurred late in May and continued in June, so the drop really was not felt in the May figures,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenblatt </PERSON>, an economist for the <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>. `` The impact of interest rates, which we expect to trend downward for the rest of the year, will have a positive effect on -LRB- housing -RRB- starts and we should see an appreciable pickup in the fall,'' <PERSON> Rosenblatt </PERSON> said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Berson </PERSON>, chief economist for the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, agreed, saying that `` we expect single family units to start going up in the next several months.'' Until recently, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> had boosted interest rates for over a year as it sought to restrain economic growth in an attempt to restrain inflation. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tuccillo </PERSON>, chief economist for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Realtors </ORGANIZATION>, said many builders thought last month's drop in mortgage rates might have been temporary. `` Further interest rate declines in June will provide the evidence needed to bring the markets around,'' he said. `` We expect the June numbers for housing starts to be higher.'' At the same time, some analysts were not so sanquine about the immediate future. `` Consumer sentiment generally is slackening,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Seiders </PERSON>, chief economist for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Homebuilders </ORGANIZATION>. `` It does n't seem the trend is getting any better, particularly single family units,'' contended real estate economist <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Summichrest </PERSON>. `` I do n't see anything more than a dropoff for the rest of the year.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported that new homes and apartments in May were built at a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.31 million units, down from 1.34 million in April when construction fell 5.0 percent. The pace in May was the slowest since the 1.30 million rate in December 1982 and represented the fourth consecutive monthly decline, the longest string since activity slowed for five months in a row from February through June 1987. Commerce said construction of single-family homes was off 4.6 percent in May to an annual rate of 980,000 units, after rising 4.7 percent in April. The April pace followed drops of 4.7 percent in March and 14.2 percent in February. Apartment construction, meanwhile, rose 6.1 percent last month to an annual rate of 331,000 units. Construction of multi-family units had fallen 27.1 percent in April and 1.8 percent in March. The Northeast led the overall decline in housing construction last month, down 9.7 percent to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 186,000 units. Declines also were recorded in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>, down 8.9 percent to 245,000 units, and the South, down 1.7 percent to 516,000 units. Construction was up 7.4 percent in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> to an annual rate of 364,000 units. Applications for building permits, a barometer of future housing activity, turned up 0.1 percent in May after a 8.5 percent hike in April. They had fallen the three previous months.

The headquarters are about 100 yards from where the dynamite was found. Officials ordered an evacuation of people within 2,000 feet of the site, between one-third and one-half mile, said fire Capt. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Roble </PERSON>. The affected area is just east of the downtown and about five blocks north of Interstate 76.

<HEAD>Consumer Prices Take Another Steep Jump in May</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NANCY BENAC</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Americans paid more for food, clothing and gasoline last month, pushing the Consumer Price Index up a steep 0.6 percent, the government said Friday in a report analysts cited as evidence of a stubborn inflation problem. Consumer prices, which had advanced an even stronger 0.7 percent in April, have risen at an annual rate of 6.7 percent so far this year, compared with price increases of 4.4 percent during 1987 and 1988. `` It's not a pretty picture,'' said economist <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Markets </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` The basic message here is that inflation is tenacious and it's not going to painlessly melt away.'' At the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, presidential spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> called the May price increase `` disappointing'' but said administration officials `` continue to believe that inflation will remain low and under control.'' While prices rose in every major category last month, the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> attributed about one-fourth of the overall May increase to a 3.9 percent uptick in gasoline prices. That gain came on top of a startling 11.4 percent increase in gas prices during the previous month, the largest jump on record. Analysts said the latest inflation report makes it unlikely that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> will act again in the near future to reduce interest rates. The central bank in March 1988 began a 15-month campaign in which it nudged interest rates upward in an attempt to curb inflation by restraining economy growth. Last week, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> slightly eased its grip on the money supply in the belief that the slowing economy would help to tame inflation. `` I think the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> can not ease again any time soon,'' <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> said. `` It's going to have to see a whole lot of economic weakening before it can ease again.'' New evidence of the drag that higher interest rates have been on economic growth became available Friday when the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported that construction of new homes and apartments declined in May for the fourth straight month. Housing starts declined 2.1 percent last month to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 1.31 million units, the lowest level since the 1982 recession. May's rise in the Consumer Price Index was heavily influenced by a 0.6 percent increase in costs for food and beverages. Prices for fruits and vegetables shot up 3.2 percent and poultry costs rose by a like margin. Energy costs, meanwhile, increased 1.6 percent in May, after shooting up 5.1 percent in April. The uptick in both months was largely due to the surge in gasoline prices. Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, all other consumer prices still were up a solid 0.5 percent in May after rising 0.2 percent in April. Many analysts believe these figures represent the `` core'' level of underlying inflationary pressures in the economy. `` Reports of inflation's demise have been grossly exaggerated,'' said economist <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Berson </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. `` The core does n't appear to be subsiding and, with the economy running close to full employment, will edge up as the year goes on.'' Apparel prices also showed a strong increase in May, rising 0.8 percent after a 0.3 percent rise in April. Smaller-than-usual price declines for women's and girls' clothing were largely responsible for the seasonally adjusted increase. <PERSON> Stacy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kottman </PERSON>, research coordinator for the <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forecasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, said last year's `` fashion bust'' may have created pent-up demand for clothing this year that allowed retailers to delay seasonal markdowns. <PERSON> Kottman </PERSON> said that despite the persistence of inflation in May, price increases could return to the 4 percent range later this year as upward pressure on food and energy costs eases. `` It's not a good report, but we can look forward to a plateauing of this increase,'' <PERSON> Kottman </PERSON> said. `` In the last half of 1989, the -LRB- inflation -RRB- range will come down.'' The various May price changes left the overall Consumer Price Index at 123.8 percent of its 1982-84 base. This means that a hypothetical selection of goods costing $ 100 during the base period would have cost $ 123.80 last month, 70 cents more than in April. In a separate report, the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Americans' average weekly earnings, after adjusting for inflation, fell 1.3 percent in May after rising 0.5 percent a month earlier Average weekly earnings in May, before adjusting for inflation, were $ 331.20, up 3.4 percent from a year earlier. Taking the 5.4 percent inflation rate for urban workers into account over the 12-month period, real weekly earnings were down 1.9 percent.

 Relations between the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> have never been better, the president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bishops </ORGANIZATION> said today. `` I believe that the bridge between <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is stronger than it has been in recent memory,'' said Archbishop <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> May </PERSON> of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>. May spoke after a morning Mass that opened the annual spring meeting of the nation's 300 bishops. His address also expressed support for a document that proposes ways to resolve disputes between bishops and theologians. The bishops are scheduled to vote Saturday on the proposal, which has been criticized by the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> for appearing to place bishops and theologians on equal levels. The bishops also were expected to tackle other controversial topics, such as normalizing relations with <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. The tone of May's talk contrasted markedly with a speech given by his predecessor, Archbishop <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Malone </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Youngstown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, before a bishops' meeting in 1986. <PERSON> Malone </PERSON> spoke of a growing disaffection among segments of the church in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> with <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>. May said today he believes relations have improved because of a series of encounters among the two groups, including the pope's <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> visit in 1987, meetings with individual bishops last year, and a March meeting of cardinals and archbishops with <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> officials. The recent meetings showed that `` whatever differences there are have to do with approach and not with doctrine,'' he said. May also appealed for the bishops to approve a proposed document on doctrinal responsibilities that has drawn substantial criticism from the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>. He said the document submitted by the bishops<ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Doctrine </ORGANIZATION> tries to foster legitimate diversity in theology, while upholding the authority of the magisterium, or church hierarchy. In March, the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> said the proposed document, which advocates the `` rights'' of theologians to lawful freedom of inquiry and expression of scholarly opinion, gives the impression bishops and theologians are on an equal footing, and `` tends logically to the erection of a second teaching authority in the Church.'' The most celebrated dispute in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> involves the Rev. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Curran </PERSON>, a priest who lost his license to teach moral theology at the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for his opposition to some church teaching, particularly in the area of sexual ethics. The bishops also are scheduled to vote on a statement calling for a normalization of relations between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurley </PERSON>, spokesman for the <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Archdiocese </LOCATION>. The four-day meeting at <ORGANIZATION> Seton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> ends Monday.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said today it expected to go ahead with plans for a new plutonium refinery in <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> despite a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel's recommendation that the department be stopped from starting construction next year. `` We still stand on our position that -LRB- it -RRB- is a very important and vital project,'' said <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaliniak </PERSON>, a department spokeswoman. A special panel of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> voted in closed session Thursday to recommend delaying the start of construction at the plant, which the department contends will assure supplies of plutonium for nuclear weapons. The panel's decision adds to congressional pressure on the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration to seek negotiations with <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to ban production of nuclear weapons materials. The panel, chaired by Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Spratt </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-S.C. </LOCATION>, recommended slashing $ 75 million from the administration's 1990 budget request for the plant, known as the Special Isotope Separation project. The panel also stipulated that none of the $ 121 million that would remain for the project in 1990 could be used for construction or site preparation, said <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Fant </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Spratt </PERSON> aide. The plant is scheduled for construction at the federal <ORGANIZATION> Idaho </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineering </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION>, near <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>. It would use a yet-to-be-developed laser technology to convert fuel-grade plutonium to weapon-grade material for nuclear weapons. The <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> had planned to begin preparing the site for construction this month. It already has spent $ 588 million on development of the technology. The Spratt panel was created earlier this year to review the administration's plans for modernizing the problem-plagued weapons program and cleaning up its wastes. The panel advises the <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, and its recommendations will go to a regular <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on military procurement. An environmental group opposed to the <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> project hailed the panel's decision as a sign that `` the tide has turned against'' the project, expected to cost $ 3.1 billion. `` The plant has never been needed and it will never be needed,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Snake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> River </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement issued from <LOCATION> Boise </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, after the <PERSON> Spratt </PERSON> panel acted. Energy Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Watkins </PERSON> has lobbied hard for the project, which he contends is needed to ensure an adequate supply of weapon-grade plutonium in the late 1990s. <PERSON> Fant </PERSON> predicted the full <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> would go along with the <PERSON> Spratt </PERSON> panel's recommended cuts. Opponents of the project, including many leading members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, contend the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has more than adequate supplies of plutonium and that embarking on additional production would hurt chances for new superpower arms control deals. A group of 29 scientists and arms control experts last month urged <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to reconsider the <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> project, saying it was not needed for national security and would undermine <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> efforts to limit the spread of nuclear weapons. <PERSON> Spratt </PERSON> said earlier this week that he opposed starting construction in <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> in 1990, saying, `` while the requirement for plutonium is real, it is not compelling.'' Reflecting a view widely held in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Spratt </PERSON> said delaying construction would `` buy time'' for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to negotiate arms issues with the Soviets. <PERSON> Spratt </PERSON> also said a delay would allow time to complete a critical set of experiments on the isotope separation technology. He said the tests could not be finished before next fall. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> are considering bills aimed at compelling the administration to seek negotiations with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to ban plutonium production. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> opposes the bills. The Soviets have expressed interest in a mutual ban. The administration also is encountering stiff congressional opposition to its plans for building two nuclear reactors _ one in <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION> and another in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> _ to produce tritium, a radioactive gas used in making nuclear warheads. The Spratt panel decided to recommend authorizing the $ 303 million sought by the administration for development of the new tritium-producing reactors in 1990, <PERSON> Fant </PERSON> said. A bid by Rep. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Schroeder </PERSON>, D-Colo., to cut $ 100 million from the program was defeated in a close vote, <PERSON> Fant </PERSON> said

<HEAD>Radical Agriultural Reforms Needed to Prevent Hunger</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH G. SEWARD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A member of parliament on Friday predicted a famine if radical agricultural reform is not undertaken in the next year, and he blamed bureaucrats for the miserable performance of Soviet farms. Other members of the parliament, the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION>, told a news confernce that agricultural reform must be a top priority, but said widespread hunger was unlikely `` I am sure that if radical transformations are not undertaken next year there will be famine waiting for us,'' said deputy <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Tikhonov </PERSON>, an economist. <PERSON> Tikhonov </PERSON> noted that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is forced to import potatoes even though large tracts of land are well-suited to raising a substantial crop. He also criticized low agricultural productivity that results in chronic shortages of meat, fruit, vegetables and grain needed for flour. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> also must import grain. He said the country may have to reduce imports because of a shortage of hard currency. Despite attempts at agricultural reform in President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s economic revival program, such products as meat, sugar, butter and potatoes are rationed in many parts of the country. <PERSON> Tikhonov </PERSON> said the key to improving farm production lies in land reform and reducing the massive state bureaucracy. `` Administrators are responsible for the crisis,'' he said without elaborating. The state controls distribution of seed, gasoline, farm machinery and fertilizer. The <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s policy-making <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> in March approved a policy of leasing land to farmers for 50 years, but maintained the state and cooperative farms that many blame for shortages. Politburo member <PERSON> Yegor </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON>, who heads a party commission to redress agricultural problems, was criticized as incompetent at the session of the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that ended last week. <PERSON> Oleg </PERSON> <PERSON> Bogomolov </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> and a parliament deputy, told the news conference economic reform must begin with agriculture and that peasants must be given land. Commenting on <PERSON> Tikhonov </PERSON>'s prognosis, <PERSON> Bogomolov </PERSON> said, `` While the possibility of famine exists, I do n't think it is a probability.'' <PERSON> Bogomolov </PERSON> said a lack of agricultural reform could have destabilizing effects on the economy in general. <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> Abalkin </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economics </ORGANIZATION> and a parliament deputy named to head a new government commission on economic reform, said he did n't think the word `` famine'' was `` quite right,'' but did not offer his own prediction.

 <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> today rejected a $ 10.7 billion buyout offer from <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION> previously planned tender offer for <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> that values <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> at more than $ 12.4 billion. The move comes amid a complicated, three-way ba. and launched attle for Time, which had announced a merger with <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> before <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> jumped in with its own bid for Time that was launched June 7. <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> said today it will proceed with its unwanted $ 175-a-share bid. Time and <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> had been expected to try to salvage their deal, which would create the world's largest media company. After the announcement, <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> stock jumped $ 3.87 -LCB- to $ 59.50 a share on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION>'s slipped $ 3.87 -LCB- to $ 167.62 -LCB- a share. Paramount stock was down $ 1 to $ 58.50 a share. Paramount's unsolicited $ 175-a-share offer was not in the best interests of the company because it is financially inadequate and highly conditional, <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> said. Time said it would pay r either company. In addition, <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> filed a lawsuit to block Paramount from taking any steps `` to disrupt the merger'' of <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The suit, filed at federal court in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>, charged securities laws violations and sought a preliminary injunction to prevent Paramount from `` aquiring or attempting to acquire any shares of <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION>'s stock'' and `` making or attempting to make any tender offer'' for Time's securities. The lawsuit charged that <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> made false and misleading statements in its tender offer. Paramount, calling Time's bid for <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> `` a defensive device, pure and simple,'' said it would continue its pursuit of Time. `` From the standpoint of Time shareholders, we do n't see how it begins to compare with our offer of $ 175 a share in cash for all share,'' <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> said. Securities analysts said the bid for <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> does little to resolve Time's battle with Paramount. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Appert </PERSON>, the media analyst for the investment firm C.J. <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grenfell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said Time still has the problem of `` figuring out a way to get to its shareholders value that is equal'' to the $ 175 a share <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> has offered. One way for Time to increase shareholder value would be to pay a special cash dividend. But <PERSON> Appert </PERSON> doubted whether Time could afford to acquire <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> and pay the dividend. He said the decline in <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION>'s stock price today indicated Wall Street is skeptical that the Time bid for <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> will be successful. If the market thought the bid would be successfully completed, he said Time's stock price would be down `` substantially more.'' Time and <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> agreed in March to merge in an all-stock deal under which <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> stockholders would get a share in the new company, <ORGANIZATION> Time-Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, for each <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> share while <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> shareholders would get 0.465 of a share of the new company for each of their <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> shares. In today's statement, <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> reiterated that it is not for sale. `` We are convinced that remaining independent and combining operations with <ORGANIZATION> WCI </ORGANIZATION> will best serve the interests of Time, its stockholders and its other constituencies,'' Time Chairman <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Munro </PERSON> said. Time said its board turned down the <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> offer because the bid was highly conditional in terms of obtaining the required $ 14 billion in financing and securing regulatory approval, which <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> said Paramount might never receive. `` An extended delay in the closing of the tender offer would substantially reduce the present value of the offer to <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> shareholders,'' Time said. Paramount, formerly called <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, announced its bid for Time on June 6, just 2 -LCB- weeks before <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> shareholders were to vote on the proposed merger. The tender offer was formally launched the next day. Time and <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> did not immediately say whether their shareholder meetings, scheduled for June 23, would take place. Since Paramount announced its bid there has been intense speculation on Wall Street over what steps Time and <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> would take to preserve their planned merger. A Time tender offer for <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> was among the options the two companies were expected to explore. On Thursday, <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> sent a letter to the <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> board, complaining he had not heard from the company, and indicating he might be willing to sweeten his offer, reportedly to pressure the Time board. In a separate development Thursday, Time and <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> said <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> city officials approved the proposed transfers in ownership of the six cable franchises in the city owned by either Time or <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>. Time and <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> together own cable systems serving about 5.5 million subscribers, but must get permission from local cable authorities in each case to transfer the ownership to the new company.

 A spokeswoman said Friday that the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> was disappointed that Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> failed to promise unconditionally to tear down the Berlin Wall. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, drawing praise Thursday from West German officials, said the wall between <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> could come down `` when those conditions that created it fall away.'' `` We noted President <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s remarks that the wall could come down some day,'' said <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON>. `` We just wish he would drop the words ` some day,''' she added. `` The West consistently has called for the wall to come down immediately,'' she said. The most recent such appeal was made by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in a speech he gave in the West German town of <LOCATION> Mainz </LOCATION> earlier this month. `` It is disappointing that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said that the wall could only come down'' when conditions that created a need for it disappear, Ms. <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said. `` The wall can never be justified.'' <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> has maintained the 100-mile wall is needed to prevent skilled workers from leaving the country and endangering the economy. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has responded that the wall drives a wedge between the <LOCATION> German </LOCATION> people and perpetuates tensions in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, winding up a visit to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, told reporters that `` the wall was raised in a concrete situation and was not dictated only by evil intention.'' It `` can disappear when those conditions that created it fall away,'' he added. West German officials praised the remarks, saying <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s willingness to discuss the matter suggested a new phase in the Kremlin's dealings there But Ms. <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> disagreed, saying `` such a statement represents what <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> himself calls ` old thinking.''' The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration has urged the reform-minded <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> leader to demonstrate new thinking by allowing more domestic liberalization and relaxing Kremlin control over its allies.

<HEAD>State Department Criticizes Israel</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> criticized <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> Friday for closing down the offices of a prominent Palestinian intellectual blamed for directing an 18-month uprising against Israeli rule of the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. The criticism came as Soviet and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials held a second day of talks on ways of advancing peace talks between <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, the 1.7 million Palestinians under its control and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s Arab neighbors. The talks at the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> are a continuation of the periodic consultations between the superpowers begun by the previous <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> administration to foster cooperation in various parts of the world. But <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials say this time the discussions on the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> could result in a role for the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in the so-called <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> peace process, which has so far been orchestrated mostly by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` The Soviets have been making some positive comments in recent months that could give them a concrete role,'' said one official, who asked not to be named. <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> declined to discuss specifics of the talks, saying only they had been `` constructive.'' The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> wants the Soviets to use their influence with the hardline <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> states like <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, as well as the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, to push forward Arab-Israeli peace talks. But it continues to insist the Soviets can only become active partners in the dialogue if they renew the diplomatic ties they broke with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in 1967. <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s decision to shut the offices of <PERSON> Sari </PERSON> <PERSON> Nusseibeh </PERSON>, an Islamic philosophy professor and journalist with close ties to <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, was counterproductive to its recent proposal for elections of <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> negotiators in the occupied territories. `` We are disturbed by actions such as this,''' she said. `` At a time when <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has put forth a positive and constructive initiative aimed at reaching out to Palestinians, it's hard to see how this step can be helpful.'' If, as <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> contends, <PERSON> Nusseibeh </PERSON> has engaged in `` illegal activities, he should be afforded an appropriate, open judicial proceeding,'' <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> added. The Nusseibeh case, which has attracted wide attention because of his ties with Western journalists, is likely to come up in talks Friday between <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials and <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> Justice Minister <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Meridor </PERSON>.

 Authorities took Western reporters to Tiananmen Square today and told them that soldiers did not shoot any demonstrators there. One army general said troops did fire into the square because they were forced to use violence to clear the area of pro-democracy protesters. Then the general reversed himself and said soldiers did not shoot at protesters. In other developments: _ The leading national daily lauded the hard-line tactics of senior leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON> and appealed for `` unity of thinking'' in a sign that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s rulers intend to stamp out all political dissent _ An aide to Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> said members of the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> leadership were guilty of supporting the demonstrators _ British officials said <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> authorities have ordered two British journalists to leave the <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> within 24 hours _ The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> criticized <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> for expelling two <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> journalists earlier this week The government previously said troops did not fire a single shot in <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>, which soldiers and tanks cleared of thousands of protesters when the crackdown began on the night of June 3-4. The government has not commented on shooting elsewhere in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. Gen. <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Zhiyun </PERSON> told reporters today that troops were forced to use violence to enter the city and clear <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> because `` people who did n't know the truth'' blocked them on the outskirts of <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. `` But still there were some thugs, they -LRB- were -RRB- still provocative to the troops. At this time, some of the soldiers in our troops directed their fire into the square,'' he said during the first news conference for Western reporters since the crackdown began. At another point <PERSON> Li </PERSON> said of the deaths: `` It is not from any instances from the soldiers directing their guns at the people. This incident never happened within the area of <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>.'' He did not clarify the contradiction. News agencies were not allowed to attend the news conference. Associated Press reporters viewed a videotape by <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> television that showed <PERSON> Li </PERSON> speaking in Chinese through an army translator. The government's call for unity by the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> came as the state moved to expunge opposition through arrests, to put out the blaze after it ran through a protest barricade, killing six people The three were the first to receive the death sentence of more than 1,000 people arrested since nationwide protests broke out after the crackdown in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. Most of those arrested have been workers, but the government has also issued all-point bulletins for 21 student leaders. Only three of those have been arrested or reported to authorities. The People's Daily editorial praised the `` keen insight and scientific judgment'' of the 84-year-old <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> in his June 9 address to military officers involved in the attack in the capital. The government variously says 200 to 300 people, mostly soldiers, were killed. Unofficial Chinese and Western intelligence reports say troops fired on unarmed crowds and killed up to 3,000. The editorial said the rebellion in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> has been put down but `` some people still harbor ideological hangups. `` Therefore, it is necessary to seek unity of thinking covering the whole party and the whole people by seriously studying the important speech made by <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON>.'' In an interview with <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> news </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Yuan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mu </PERSON>, an assistant to Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON>, said today that `` certain individuals'' in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s leadership were `` guilty of supprting counterrevolutionary turmoil. `` But their questions will be dealt with soon and will be made public,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON> has not been seen in public since the day before Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> declared martial law on May 20. <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> expressed sympathy for the students. The newspaper said <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> must abide by `` one center and two basic points.'' The center, it said, is the party and the people. It defined the two points as principles of communist rule and socialism in addition to continued open-door and reform policies. The editorial indicated the ruling party will no longer tolerate criticism of its policies, as it did to a limited extent in the months before the crackdown. In his June 9 speech, <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> protesters rallied under the slogans `` down with the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'' and `` overturn Although many did praise Western democracy, their stated goals were to open a dialogue with the government, guarantee a free press, and end corruption among officials. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> said in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> that <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> authorities today ordered two of its journalists to leave the country within 24 hours. Reporter <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> <PERSON> Mann </PERSON> and cameramen <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Elphinstone </PERSON>, both based in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, were detained on Wednesday while filming the aftermath of the unrest in <LOCATION> Sichuan </LOCATION> province in western <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, and had been held under house arrest in their hotel, <ORGANIZATION> ITN </ORGANIZATION> said. Chinese authorities accused them of violating martial law regulations, which ban coverage of the protests.

 The tiny Dusky seaside sparrow has become the nation's first bird to become extinct since the endangered species list was created in 1966, conservationists said Friday. Along with that sad conclusion, conservationists who spent the past week hiking through miles of chest-high grass and muddy streams said they were virtually certain that three unaccounted-for hybrid descendants of the Dusky have also died. `` They are gone, all of them,'' said curator-ornithologist <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Cook </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Walt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Discovery </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, where the hybrids were bred.

<HEAD>Bush To Prosecutors: No Deals With Criminals Who Use Guns</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Federal prosecutors on Friday got orders to be `` especially vigilant'' on stern prosecution of violent offenders as President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> directed them not to make deals with criminals who use guns. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> continued touting the crime package he delivered to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> this week, by inviting the nation's 94 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorneys to the White House Friday morning and later having lunch with a group of law enforcement agency heads. In remarks to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorneys, the president said, `` We're going to up the stakes for those who calculate that our criminal justice system is a crapshoot where the risks are worth the rewards And when criminals think about reaching for a gun, they're going to know _ and they're gong to learn _ that they will do time. Hard time.'' Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> distributed guidelines to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorneys to implement the president's approach. <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> wrote: `` In all but exceptional cases such as those in which the defendant has provided substantial assistance to the government in the investigation or prosecution of crimes by others, federal prosecutors will seek conviction for any offense involving the unlawful use of a firearm which is readily provable.'' The guidelines said that sentencing should reflect `` the totality and seriousness of the defendant's conduct.'' `` The specific affirmation of these policies by the president requires that you be especially vigilant about their full implementation in your district,'' <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> wrote. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> called the prosecutors `` the commanders at the frontlines'' and urged them to help `` put away the nation's most wanted.'' `` The situation in our streets has been aptly compared to a shooting war,'' he told the gathering in the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Room </LOCATION> of the White House. The events Friday were to keep the spotlight on the $ 1.2 billion legislation he sent to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday with his anti-crime proposals. The package calls for $ 1 billion in new prison capacity, in addition to hiring 1,600 new prosecutors to work under the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorneys and 825 new federal agents. It also calls for doubling the mandatory penalty for use of semi-automatic weapons in drug or violent crimes to 10 years.

<TEXT>
 A jury began deliberating federal perjury charges against <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> Friday after hearing a prosecutor describe the former congressman as a liar who `` was willing to deal with the devil'' _ but only in private. The jury got the case about 2:30 p.m. and planned to deliberate about an hour before going home. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON> said deliberations will continue Saturday. In his closing statement in the 4-week-old trial, Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Gillen </PERSON> said <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> knew he was negotiating for an illegal money deal, made plans to cover his tracks and then lied repeatedly about it to a grand jury investigating money laundering. Defense attorneys said <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> was guilty of poor judgment in considering the money deal, but never did anything wrong and did his best to recall the details for the grand jury. <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> was indicted on nine counts of perjury for lying to a grand jury on Feb. 2, 1988, about his negotiations with an undercover agent posing as a money launderer and with a <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> associate concerning an $ 850,000 loan to finish building the former congressman's luxurious home. <PERSON> Gillen </PERSON> noted that <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> told the grand jury he could n't recall being told the money was drug-related and said he had `` walked away from it, basically.'' The prosecutor pointed out that in a Sept. 13, 1987, meeting with the agent and <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> associate <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> LeChasney </PERSON>, <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> was repeatedly told the money was drug-related, but continued to deal. `` He will deal with the devil,'' <PERSON> Gillen </PERSON> said. `` He sat there, and listened to it, and he did n't walk away.'' <PERSON> Gillen </PERSON> scoffed at the notion that <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> did n't recall that meeting with undercover agent <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Mullaney </PERSON> at <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>'s posh <LOCATION> Greenbriar </LOCATION> resort. `` Do you think you would remember,'' <PERSON> Gillen </PERSON> asked the jury, `` if you took a walk with a man you believed to be a criminal, at one of the ritziest resorts in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>? And he tells you narcotics dollars are involved ... what he does violates currency laws? `` Do you think you would remember? Do you think you could ever forget?'' <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON>, who did not testify in his own defense, sat still, jaw clenched, as <PERSON> Gillen </PERSON> accused him of lies. <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON>'s lead defense attorney, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Hendrix </PERSON>, admitted to the jury that <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> is `` guilty of poor judgment, foolishness, stupidity and just plain being dumb.'' But he attacked the credibility of LeChasney, an admitted con man who testified for the prosecution, and pointed out that former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, advising <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> before his grand jury appearance, urged a postponement because of <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON>'s fatigue. `` Did you believe <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>? Did you find him a credible man?'' <PERSON> Hendrix </PERSON> asked. `` If you did, that's reasonable doubt on every count.'' <PERSON> Gillen </PERSON> angrily noted that <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> was granted a postponement of his appearance but refused in order to keep to his schedule. Defense attorney <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Thrash </PERSON> accused the government of `` inviting <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> into a perjury trap'' in order to `` add a <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> congressman to the trophy case.'' Thrash argued that, in his grand jury testimony, <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> acknowledged many of the things he is accused of misleading the grand jury about. And he said that while <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON> `` is a sinner ... he's not a criminal.'' `` In the name of God,'' Thrash whispered to the jury, `` let this nightmare end _ now.'' <PERSON> Swindall </PERSON>, under the cloud of the perjury indictment against him, lost his congressional seat in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>'s eastern suburbs to Democrat <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> last November.

 An ancient Chumash Indian village with artifacts dating back at least 5,000 years has been discovered by workers bulldozing a college campus site where a new building was planned.

Archaeologists have long searched for the village contemporary Chumash knew of as <PERSON> Mupu </PERSON>. They determined in 1976 that Chumash artifacts were buried around the small <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> college, nestled in a largely rural area 50 miles northwest of downtown <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. `` The bulldozer made its first pass and brought up bones,'' said C.W. <PERSON> Clewlow </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Ancient </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprises </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a cultural resources consulting firm in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Monica </LOCATION>. `` The remains have been removed and reburied by the Chumash, who have been wonderfully cooperative about the whole recovery,'' said <PERSON> Clewlow </PERSON>, a former chief archaeologist at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Clewlow </PERSON> had been involved in the search since 1976.

Dr. <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Turnock </PERSON> has fought the <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> testing program from the outset and has said repeatedly that the results do not justify the expense. Turnock and a colleague at the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> say in a study published Friday that they found that of the 70,846 marriage license applicants tested for AIDS in the first six months of the program, only .011 percent were infected with the AIDS virus. <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> is the only state that requires the tests prior to issuing marriage licenses. In 1987, 33 states considered similar legislation, but only <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> adopted it. <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> repealed its law after six months, according to the article in Friday's Journal of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. Illinois adopted the law in 1986, spurred by those who said the testing would prevent the spread of the AIDS virus among heterosexuals and their children. A move to repeal premarital AIDS testing law is pending in the state <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and may come to a vote next week. The period <PERSON> Turnock </PERSON> studied was from January to June, 1988. In a more recent examination, he found that of 150,000 marriage applicants tested through November 1988, 23 tested positive for the virus. `` The Illinois experience with premarital testing provides a strong argument against widespread mandatory or publicly supported HIV antibody screening of low prevalence population,'' the authors wrote. The authors also noted that the number of marriage licenses issued during the first six months of the program dropped 22.5 percent, as about 10,300 residents traveled to other states to get married. That cost <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> $ 77,250 in revenue, they said.

 At least two more Chinese diplomats in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> have been granted refuge here, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> sources said today. Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> deplores the persecutions of Chinese demonstrators but has no current plans to impose further sanctions on <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. Two diplomats in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> last week were given <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> permission to remain in the country. A <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official speaking on condition of anonymity said today `` there have been additional Chinese officials who have asked for protection in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' Such diplomats are covered under <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s recent order that grants any Chinese citizen permission to stay in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> until June 1990, the official said. The Chinese diplomats have not formally asked for asylum, but could do so in the future, the official said. He source declined to specify the number of Chinese diplomats involved, and said he could not confirm a report that two diplomats in the <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> had sought such protection. Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> has been negotiating with Chinese Ambassador <PERSON> Han </PERSON> <PERSON> Xu </PERSON> to resolve a dispute over the Chinese dissident <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> <PERSON> Lizhi </PERSON> and his wife, who are being shielded in the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. Speaking of administration plans with regard to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, White House press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said, `` We continue to watch the situation. We'll continue to measure it as we go forward. Sanctions are always a part of that review, but we have nothing to announce.'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, speaking a day after the Chinese government sentenced some protesters to death, declined to characterize <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s reaction to the current effort by <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> to rewrite the story of the bloody protest and its claim that no demonstrators were killed. But he said anyone who has seen the television reports knows what happened, despite the Chinese propoganda attempts. `` Those matters all speak for themselves ... The pictures and the reality of the reporting has been so dramatic that these kind of efforts stand beside them so starkly that I would n't even want to try to diminish that by giving it words,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> read from a prepared statement, saying, `` The persecution of people for the exercise of basic human rights such as the freedom of expression, freedom of association, freedom of the press is of course deplorable.'' Further, he said, `` The aspirations expressed by the people killed in <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> and those who are being persecuted today will not be stilled by harsh repression.'' `` We believe that dialogue and reform, not arrests and show trials, are the route which offer the best hope for stability in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>.'' The comments bolstered those of a top administration official Thursday that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> still can do business with <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON> despite his military crackdown and the massacre of hundreds _ perhaps thousands _ of people. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has been reluctant to affix blame for <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s bloodshed but has said it would be `` extraordinarily difficult'' for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to have normal relations with officials responsible for the massacre of students and workers participating in pro-democracy protests. However, the administration official, a top policymaker in <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s inner circle who spoke on condition of anonymity, said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ties with <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> involve `` a very important relationship with a very important country. Despite the crackdown, the official said, `` <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has come a long way since 1972'' when <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> re-established ties with <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. The official called <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> `` a great, important country in the world, and we have great stakes there.'' `` I think they have made a decision that they're going to restore order and that they're going to try to rediscipline the system,'' the official said. `` It is not so clear that they have made a major reversal in course and will not resume a path like they were on before. I think it's premature to make that decision.'' The official appeared open to continued contacts with <PERSON> Deng </PERSON>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s senior leader, who has praised the military for its bloody assault against Chinese citizens. `` He is the head of a very major country. There are lots of heads of government and state who do things that we do n't like that we do business with,'' the official said. `` Are you suggesting we should not have done any business with -LRB- Soviet leaders <PERSON> Nikita </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Khrushchev </PERSON>, -LRB- <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>, anybody who has done anything wrong?'' the official asked. Saying it was premature to say <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has abandoned reforms, the official added, `` It is not so clear that they have made a major reversal in course and will not resume a path like they were on before.''

 Thousands of radical students hurling rocks and firebombs battled riot police in five cities Friday, the second day of widespread anti-government campus protests. About 30 people were injured. Violent clashes between students and riot police broke out on campuses in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kwangju </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Taejon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chonju </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Taegu </LOCATION> after protesters were blocked from marching into the streets, police officials said. Officials estimated about 5,000 students were involved in the protests of the government of President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> Tae-woo. Students, hurling rocks and firebombs, surged out of their schools after campus rallies, but police did not fire tear gas. Protesters yelled: `` Punish <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> Tae-woo!'' and `` Down with dictatorship!'' Fierce fighting erupted at <ORGANIZATION> Hankuk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in eastern <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, where about 2,000 students from seven colleges fought police with more than 1,000 firebombs. Police hurled back rocks thrown by students but did not use tear gas. About 30 students and police were injured in the two-hour clash, but there were no reports of arrests, police said. Student leaders called for the overthrow of <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> and demanded that they be allowed to take part in a youth festival next month in communist <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. `` March to <LOCATION> Pyongyang </LOCATION>!'' students chanted as they beat drums and waved flags. Students at <ORGANIZATION> Hankuk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> marched out of the campus and attacked riot police blocking the road with wooden clubs and iron bars. Protesters then attacked with firebombs and several officers were set ablaze, but the fires were quickly put out by other troopers. Protesters knocked down parts of the school's wall and hurled the debris at police. Police set up iron barricades in the streets to hold students back during the fighting that lasted more than an hour. The students and allied dissident groups have littlepublic support because of their extremist views and violent tactics. In the southeastern city of <LOCATION> Taegu </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>'s hometown, about 50 students attacked a government party office with about a dozen firebombs, destroying windows. Eleven students were arrested. The fighting marked the second day of widespread campus clashes in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> and other cities and indicated radical students had abandoned a self-imposed ban on firebombs. Major student groups said they would stop using the weapons after seven riot police were killed in a May 3 campus clash. Student leaders, who refused to be identified, said they had been forced to use firebombs as self-defense against police attacks. But the fighting Friday all appeared to have been started by students when police blocked the marches. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s government has refused to allow the students to take part in next month's 13th World Youth Festival in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. The two nations are bitter rivals and <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> has accused <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> of inciting the unrest.

 Thousands of blacks stayed away from work and school Friday to mark the 13th anniversary of the <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION> township riots, in which police opened fire on black schoolchildren protesting education policies. The riots brought a new level of militancy to the anti-apartheid movement, and the government does not recognize the June 16 Soweto Day holiday declared by blacks and recognized by most major employers. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government observed the anniversary with a call for the release of imprisoned black leader <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>. At the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> called on <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> to eliminate apartheid. An estimated 500-700 blacks were killed in nationwide riots that erupted after police fired on children marching in <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION> to protest being taught in <LOCATION> Afrikaans </LOCATION>, the language of the white Afrikaners who control the government. Vandals on Thursday smashed the tombstone of <PERSON> Hector </PERSON> <PERSON> Pieterson </PERSON>, a 13-year-old who was the first person killed June 16, 1976. Friends said <PERSON> Pieterson </PERSON>'s mother found the smashed headstone at a cemetery in <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION> when she arrived to place flowers on the grave Friday. `` The event will remain forever etched in letters of stone and gold in the history of this land when the children said, ` Enough is enough,''' Anglican Archbishop <PERSON> Desmond </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutu </PERSON> told a church service in the black township of <LOCATION> Manenberg </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>. `` When you perpetuate injustice, oppression and exploitation, you are not just taking on ordinary human beings, you are fighting against God,'' he said. Police used tear gas to disperse 3,000 people who attended a rally at the <ORGANIZATION> Regina </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mundi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION>, the black township of 2.5 million outside <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>. The crowd of about 3,000 sang, chanted and danced. Police had a water cannon outside but did not use it. Police also fired tear gas to break up a church service outside <LOCATION> Durban </LOCATION>, witnesses said. A group of blacks apparently attempting to enforce the work stayaway made a blockade of burning tires and fatally stabbed a black motorist in <LOCATION> Guguletu </LOCATION>, a township outside <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>, police said. Police reported several buses were stoned and set afire in <LOCATION> Natal </LOCATION> province, where officers armed with rifles rode trains and escorted commuter buses to make sure those who wanted to work could. In <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Durban </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>, black commuter traffic was less than half the weekday average, according to various estimates. Bus stops, railway stations, and taxi stands were empty. Black schools nationwide were deserted. Buses in <LOCATION> Durban </LOCATION> traveled under police escort to prevent attacks by black militants attempting to enforce the work stoppage. In the past few years, major employer organizations, such as those in the steel, garment and supermarket industries, have included June 16 as a paid holiday in their contracts with unions. Other businesses, such as mines, have adopted a no-work, no-pay, no-punishment policy. Hundreds of small white-owned shops and cafes throughout the country have similar policies or close for the day. Almost all black-owned businesses close. The original goal of the marching schoolchildren has been achieved: they now can choose which language they are taught in. But other complaints about black education have not been addressed. The government recently abandoned its plan to make black and white education standards equal in 10 years, saying the booming population of black children and reduced government revenues makes it impossible. The government spends five times as much for every white child's schooling as it does for each black pupil. At the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickering </PERSON>, speaking as president of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, said the council condemned the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> African </LOCATION> government for its use of force in <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION> and urged <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> to eliminate apartheid. Under apartheid, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s 5 million whites exercise political and economic control over 28 million blacks. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> renewed the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> call for the release of <LOCATION> Mandela </LOCATION>, the 70-year-old <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> leader sentenced to life in prison in 1964 for sabotage and conspiracy to topple the government.

 The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> chairman welcomed on Friday <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s arrest of a decorated Army general on corruption charges as a potential turning point in the country's approach to narcotics problems. South American drug dealers have been making increasing use of Cuban air space and territorial waters for U.S.-bound narcotics deliveries, an activity that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials last week said strongly suggested the collaboration of Cuban authorities. <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> is directly in the flight path between <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> and south <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, and the number of suspicious northbound flights through Cuban airspace has increased in the past several months, according to administration officials. The <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> also has detected an increase in air drops of drugs into Cuban territorial waters. The cargo is then picked up by speedboats for delivery to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ports, the officials said. `` To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time the <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> government has admitted involvement of Cuban officials in drug smuggling operations,'' <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said of the arrest of Gen. <PERSON> Arnaldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON>. The Cuban party newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Granma </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> had been taken into custoday because he engaged in `` grave acts of corruption and dishonest use of economic resources.'' <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> is a veteran of fighting in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> and also served as commander of Cuban forces in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> in the mid-1980s. According to <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON> <PERSON> Fermoselle </PERSON>, a Cuban exile and an expert on the Cuban military, <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> was awarded the title `` Hero of the Revolution'' in 1984. Ms. <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> noted that the June 15 edition of <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Commmunist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> newspaper had accused <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> and and other officials `` of making contacts with international drug traffickers and reaching agreements with them.'' She also pointed out that <ORGANIZATION> Cuba </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> reported that two armed force officers and four ministry of interior officers had been arrested, and quoted the report as saying that `` it is possible that <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> and his accomplices cooperated in drug trafficking operations near <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> territory.'' The spokeswoman said the administration hopes `` the charges against <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> and the other officers will be investigated and, if found true, will be prosecuted to the fullest extent possible.'' Meanwhile, Sen. <PERSON> Claiborne </PERSON> <PERSON> Pell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-R.I. </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> chairman, said, `` This arrest could open the way for mutually beneficial cooperation between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> to combat the narcotics trafficking that is taking place in the sea and air space that we share.'' <PERSON> Pell </PERSON> earlier proposed that the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> and the Cuban border patrol cooperate on narcotics interdiction.

 Throngs of Hungarians paid homage Friday to <PERSON> Imre </PERSON> <PERSON> Nagy </PERSON> and others executed for leading the anti-Soviet revolt of 1956, which <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>'s new communist leaders now call the origin of their liberal reforms. After hours of ceremonies, the remains of the former premier and four associates were interred again, 31 years after they were put to death and buried in unmarked graves on the same spot. Speeches at the gravesides and at an earlier ceremony in Heroes' Square reflected both sorrow about a national tragedy and the spirit that drove the 11-day revolt ended by Soviet tanks on Nov. 4, 1956 In the square, the coffins were dispayed on a special platform. A sixth coffin, empty, was set above them to symbolize all the others who died in the uprising and subsequent reprisals. `` If we can muster enough courage, then we can put an end to communist dictatorship,'' said <PERSON> Viktor </PERSON> <PERSON> Orban </PERSON> of the independent youth group, <ORGANIZATION> FIDESZ </ORGANIZATION>. He demanded the withdrawal of Soviet military forces from <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. `` This day marks the change of an era,'' <PERSON> Imre </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecs </PERSON>, who was a student leader in 1956, told the crowd. `` We are burying a regime that was bad from the start, which was rejected by the nation, which was forced upon us and which has proven bankrupt in every regard.'' People joined hands across the square and said, with <PERSON> Mecs </PERSON>: `` We swear that we will never again be slaves!'' At <PERSON> Nagy </PERSON>'s grave, <PERSON> Tibor </PERSON> <PERSON> Meray </PERSON>, a journalist who has lived in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> since 1956, praised him and his associates as the fathers of communist reform. `` From <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>, from <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> to the Peking youth ... those movements all have their point of departure with you,'' <PERSON> Meray </PERSON> said at plot 301 in <LOCATION> Budapest </LOCATION>'s Rakoskeresztur cemetery. `` The roots of what is happening in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> now go back to you,'' he said. `` The epicenter of the earthquake shaking the Communist world is here in plot 301.'' Official Stalinist versions of history are being re-examined throughout the Soviet bloc, inspired by <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s `` glasnost'' policy of openness and the Soviet leader's own criticism of <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s excesses In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Tutwiler </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> sees the honoring of <PERSON> Nagy </PERSON> `` as part of a larger process, that of <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> coming to grips with the truth of its past ... as the country moves further along the path of freedom toward democracy.'' Those buried with <PERSON> Nagy </PERSON> were his defense minister, <PERSON> Pal </PERSON> <PERSON> Maleter </PERSON>; Minister of State <PERSON> Geza </PERSON> <PERSON> Losonczy </PERSON>; the head of his secretariat, <PERSON> Joszef </PERSON> <PERSON> Szilagyi </PERSON>, and journalist <PERSON> Miklos </PERSON> <PERSON> Gimes </PERSON>, a close associate. All but <PERSON> Szilagyi </PERSON>, who was put to death two months earlier, were executed June 16, 1958. A year ago, police used clubs to disperse a demonstration on the 30th anniversary. The change began in February, when the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> decided the 1956 revolt began with a popular uprising and was not a counterrevolution as previously held. On Wednesday, a government statement described <PERSON> Nagy </PERSON> as an `` outstanding statesman.'' <PERSON> Orban </PERSON>, the student leader, mocked the official change of heart. `` We can not understand the party leaders and statesmen who saw to it that we were taught from books that falsified the revolution, and now rush to touch the coffins as if they were good luck charmsk,'' he said. The crowd applauded. <PERSON> Janos </PERSON> <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON>, who became party chief when the revolt was crushed, was absent from Friday's ceremony. It was televised live and brought thousands of exiles hoem from abroad, some for the first time since 1956. <PERSON> Kadar </PERSON>, 77 and said to be ailing, lost the party leadership a year ago and was stripped of his last political posts in May. Politburo reformer <PERSON> Imre </PERSON> <PERSON> Pozsgay </PERSON> and Premier <PERSON> Miklos </PERSON> <PERSON> Nemeth </PERSON>, two rising political stars, laid a wreath at Heroes' Square and stood in honor guard around <PERSON> Nagy </PERSON>'s coffin. State TV and the official news agency <ORGANIZATION> MTI </ORGANIZATION> estimated the crowd at 250,000. <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Palmer </PERSON> was among foreign dignitaries attending. Absent were <LOCATION> Romania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Albania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, whose military assault on student demonstrators recalled 1956 for many Hungarians. Many with personal memories of the uprising. Younger people wore black armbands bearing the national colors red, white and green, and <PERSON> Nagy </PERSON>'s photograph or `` 56.'' <PERSON> Bela </PERSON> <PERSON> Kiraly </PERSON>, who commanded the paramilitary national guard under <PERSON> Nagy </PERSON>, said he had vowed not to return from exile in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> `` until and unless the <LOCATION> Hungarian </LOCATION> people -LRB- could -RRB- express their homage to <PERSON> Imre </PERSON> <PERSON> Nagy </PERSON> and his fellow martyrs. Today is that glorious day.'' `` The Stalinists forced Bolshevik ideas and the Soviet system upon the Hungarians,'' he declared to the crowd. `` They forged shackles out of ideology and put the Hungarian nation into irons.'' Large Hungarian flags hung in Heroes' Square, with holes cut in the center and filled with black cloth. During the revolt, many rebels cut out the Soviet hammer and sickle that was then part of the national flag.

 A man described by an attorney as having lived two lives left two women claiming to be his widow and fighting over his $ 8 million estate. A trial is scheduled to start Monday in <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on which of two wills left by <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> is valid. <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, 75, of <LOCATION> Anniston </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Flossie </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, 62, of <LOCATION> Tallahassee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, claim to have been married at the same time to <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, a real estate developer and farmer in <LOCATION> Calhoun </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. Both women say they learned that their husband had two wives only after his death. After <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> died last year at 77, <PERSON> Flossie </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> presented a will she said he wrote in 1969 placing most of his estate in a trust fund for her and their two children, said A.W. Bolt, an attorney for <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bolt </PERSON> said <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> is contesting the will on grounds that <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> was `` under undue influence'' of <PERSON> Flossie </PERSON> when he wrote it. <PERSON> Bolt </PERSON> said a 1959 will leaving the estate to <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> was found three weeks ago. She and <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> had no children. <PERSON> Bolt </PERSON> said <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> lived two lives, spending weekends and holidays with Flossie in <LOCATION> Tallahassee </LOCATION> and weekdays on the farm with <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON>. After about 30 years of marriage to <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bolt </PERSON> said, <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> met the other woman in 1959, when she and her husband worked as tenant farmers on his property. <PERSON> Bolt </PERSON> said <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> soon became entangled with <PERSON> Flossie </PERSON>, that <PERSON> Flossie </PERSON> divorced her husband and, with her daughter, moved in with the <ORGANIZATION> Davises </ORGANIZATION>. `` <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> started noticing <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> and <PERSON> Flossie </PERSON> fondling one another,'' <PERSON> Bolt </PERSON> said, and she insisted that the other woman move out. Instead, <PERSON> Bolt </PERSON> said, <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> had <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> institutionalized three times for `` imagining things.'' He said that while <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> was under the influence of medication, <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> had her sign a post-nuptial agreement that essentially cut her out of any inheritance. <PERSON> Flossie </PERSON> claims <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> married her in 1960, and two years later moved her and her daughter to <LOCATION> Tallahassee </LOCATION>. `` He bought her a home, set her up and supported her the rest of his life,'' <PERSON> Bolt </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> said she never knew about her husband's marriage to <PERSON> Flossie </PERSON>. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Burnham </PERSON>, <PERSON> Flossie </PERSON>'s attorney, said his client had thought her husband divorced <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> before their marriage.

 <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s leadership intensified efforts Friday to absolve itself in the deaths of pro-democracy protesters. A government spokesman also acknowledged for the first time there was a split among <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> officials over how to deal with the popular uprising. Also on Friday, nearly 100 more people were arrested nationwide for taking part in the protests _ including a fourth person named on a wanted list of 21 student leaders _ and the government ordered two more Western reporters to leave the country. An army spokesman, Gen. <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Zhiyun </PERSON>, said for the first time that soldiers fired into Tiananmen Square the night of June 3-4, but later contradicted himself. `` Some of the soldiers ... directed their fire into the square,'' <PERSON> Li </PERSON> told selected Western reporters during a news conference at the Great Hall of the People. At another point, however, <PERSON> Li </PERSON> said of the deaths: `` It is not from any instances from the soldiers directing their guns at the people. This incident never happened within the area of <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>.'' Reporters who were not allowed to attend the news conference obtained the comments by watching a CBS News videotape. <PERSON> Li </PERSON> spoke through an official translator and did not clarify the remarks. Before the news conference, the military took selected Western reporters on their first tour of the square since the fighting. The government campaign appeared aimed at demonstrating that protesters were not shot while they were inside the 100-acre square, the symbolic center of power in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. Although Tiananmen Square was the focus of the demonstrations, reporters on the scene said most of the shooting was on <LOCATION> Changan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Avenue </LOCATION>, the main road to the square. But there were conflicting reports during the confused fighting in the darkness and some students reported shooting inside the square. Other shooting incidents were reported from the edges of the square and at the bridge at <LOCATION> Muxudi </LOCATION>, the western gateway to the inner city. Reporters saw many wounded students treated at tents set up by protesters in <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>. The heaviest fighting occurred on the road to the square and the government has previously acknowledged that some soldiers shot civilians to death while pushing their way toward <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION>. But officials have insisted that no shots were fired when troops entered the square with tanks, and that no one died there. The government says the fighting killed nearly 100 soldiers and police, and about 100 civilians. Chinese witnesses and Western intelligence estimate the death toll may have been as high as 3,000. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s evening TV news showed crews disinfecting the square, repairing the pavement and replanting bushes. It did not say when it would be reopened. Soldiers held solemn memorials for troops killed in the fighting. Shrines were set up on the streets where several soldiers died, and TV showed residents bowing in front of pictures of the dead. Government spokesman <PERSON> Yuan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mu </PERSON>, asked in an interview with NBC News about the fate of Communist Party General Secretary <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON>, said: `` It is true that certain individuals in the top <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> leadership are guilty of supporting the counterrevolutionary _ of supporting turmoil.'' `` But their questions will be dealt with soon and will be made public,'' he said. He did not mention <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> by name. The party chief has not been seen in public since May 19, when he visited student protesters occupying <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> and tearfully appealed to them to go home. He said with apparent sympathy that the problems they had raised, including official corruption, would be resolved with time. Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> declared martial law in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> the next day. Sources later said senior leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON>, joined by aging conservatives, stripped <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> of his power, but that he had yet to be formally removed from office. Yuan skirted a question on whether <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> might invade the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> to arrest dissidents <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> <PERSON> Lizhi </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Shuxian </PERSON>, who took refuge there after the army marched into <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION>. `` He must be brought to justice. We will deal with him according to legal procedures,'' <PERSON> Yuan </PERSON> said. The translator stumbled on the reply, saying <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> had been served `` a death _ an arrest warrant.'' The official media continued its attacks on the protesters and on <PERSON> Fang </PERSON>, who is accused of plotting to overthrow the party; he did not participate in the demonstrations. Hardliners called on the nation to study the `` penetrating analysis'' of <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> on the true goals of the seven-week, student-led movement for a freer society. The party newspaper, the People's Daily, said: `` This is the most powerful ideological weapon for lancing every kind of ideological pimple.'' It described the students and their supporters as `` a gang of political hoodlums, the evil remnants of the Gang of Four and other dregs of society.'' The Gang of Four were the radical leaders of the 1966-76 violent far-left Cultural Revolution. The number of arrests reported since the crackdown began climbed past 1,185. Among arrests announced Friday was <PERSON> Ma </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaofeng </PERSON>, a 24-year-old student from the <ORGANIZATION> Beijing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Film </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> who was a leader in the independent student union that organized the protests. A radio report said <PERSON> Ma </PERSON> surrendered in southeastern <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Guangdong </LOCATION> province That left at large 17 of the 21 student leaders named on a wanted circular distributed Tuesday. The government gave two journalists from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> 24 hours to leave the country. <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> <PERSON> Mann </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Elphinstone </PERSON>, both in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> on temporary visas, had been filming the aftermath of protests in the southwestern city of <LOCATION> Chengdu </LOCATION>. Another ITN reporter was ordered expelled from <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> last week. Two Beijing-based reporters, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Pomfret </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Pessin </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, were scheduled to leave <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> on Saturday after being ordered out. Chinese authorities accused all of the journalists of violating martial law regulations, which ban coverage of the protests. The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> issued a statement in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> deploring the expulsions. `` It is essential ... that reporters or organizations such as The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> have the access and opportunity to report,'' said <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>, executive editor of The <ORGANIZATION> Philadelphia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inquirer </ORGANIZATION> and committee chairman. `` We urge the leaders of the People's Republic to reinstate <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Pomfret </PERSON> and to increase, not decrease, access to events in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>,'' he said.

 An army general said Friday that the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> fired on unarmed civilians when it entered Tiananmen Square because soldiers were provoked by `` thugs. But at a confusing news conference, Gen. <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Zhiyun </PERSON> later contradicted that statement, saying soldiers did not shoot at the protesters. The government invited selected journalists to attend the news conference, the first since it began its crackdown on the pro-democracy movement, and a subsequent tour of the square. News agencies were not allowed to participate. Associated Press reporters obtained <PERSON> Li </PERSON>'s remarks by viewing a videotape made by <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>. He spoke through a translator. <PERSON> Li </PERSON> said troops were forced to use violence to enter the city on June 3-4 because `` people who did n't know the truth'' blocked the soldiers on the outskirts of <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. He said soldiers in tanks and armored personnel carriers `` exercised restraint'' in trying to clear student-led demonstrators from <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION>. `` But still there were some thugs,'' <PERSON> Li </PERSON> said during the news conference in the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hall </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> the </LOCATION> <LOCATION> People </LOCATION> near the square. `` At this time, some of the soldiers in our troops directed their fire into the square and especially those troops that have wounded or dead soldiers within their troops. `` The rest of the soldiers started fire to those thugs who were provocative to them.'' But at another point <PERSON> Li </PERSON> said of the deaths: `` It is not from any instances from the soldiers directing their guns at the people. This incident -LRB- soldiers firing on citizens -RRB- never happened within the area of <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Li </PERSON> did not clarify the contradiction. The government previously had denied that a single shot was fired in <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION>, but had not commented on shooting elsewhere in the city. The government's actions Friday appeared to be part of a campaign aimed at demonstrating that protesters were not shot while they were inside the 100-acre square. Although Tiananmen Square was the focus of the demonstrations, reporters on the scene said most of the shooting was on <LOCATION> Changan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Avenue </LOCATION>, the main road to the square. But there were conflicting reports during the confused fighting in the darkness and some students reported shooting inside the square. Other shooting incidents were reported from the edges of the square and at the bridge at <LOCATION> Muxudi </LOCATION>, the western gateway to the inner city. Reporters saw many wounded students treated at tents set up by protesters in <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Li </PERSON> said protesters in <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> attacked soldiers with sticks and threw stones and bricks, and that snipers fired on them from buildings on the edge of the square. `` Some of the soldiers were beaten until they fainted, and even some were beaten until death.'' <PERSON> Li </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said nearly 100 soldiers and police died and that thousands were injured, while about 100 civilians died and nearly 1,000 were injured. It did not account for the discrepancy with government figures issued last week that said nearly 300 people died altogether. Chinese witnesses and Western intelligence sources said the death toll may have been as high as 3,000. Reporters in the square the night of the crackdown said there appeared to be less firing there than in other parts of the city. There were reports in the <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> media that tanks rolled over tents in which students were sleeping, and that soldiers later burned the bodies. Western reporters said they only saw tanks roll over piles of bedding, but were not sure if people were crushed. Reporters saw soldiers firing indiscriminately at crowds as the troops moved toward the square. Western reporters fled the square shortly after the army began moving in. Students had occupied the square for several weeks before the crackdown. Tiananmen is in the center of <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> and is the symbolic heart of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. On one side stands the former <ORGANIZATION> Imperial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palace </ORGANIZATION>, on another is the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hall </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> the </LOCATION> <LOCATION> People </LOCATION>, the seat of government. It remained closed to pedestrians on Friday.

<HEAD>Japan, Hong Kong Join Worldwide Effort To Ban Ivory Trade</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARI YAMAGUCHI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> announced Friday they will end most ivory imports as part of a worldwide effort to protect African elephants, in danger of being hunted to extinction. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> were considered particularly critical to any effective reduction in ivory demand. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> is the largest importer and consumer of ivory, accounting for 40 percent of the world market. <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> is heavily involved in making ivory carvings for reexport. Conservationists estimate African elephant populations have dropped by half to two-thirds in the past decade, from 1.5 million in 1978 to between 400,000 and 700,000 today. Ivory exports have increased from 300 tons a year in the 1950s to more than 800 tons annually this decade, they say. The <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> said the Japanese ban will take effect Monday. It will exclude raw African ivory specially certified under an international agreement. Such ivory accounts for about 13 percent of the imports. <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> announced a moratorium on all raw ivory imports but said traders and importers who had entered into contractual agreements before Friday were exempt. Their pledges came one day after <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> said it will ban ivory imports. Since June 4, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the 12-nation <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>, and <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> also have imposed bans on ivory imports. `` It's been a real snowball effect,'' <PERSON> Jorgen </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomsen </PERSON>, senior program officer for elephant conservation at the World Wildlife Fund, said Friday. The 102-nation Convention on <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> in </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Endangered </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Species </ORGANIZATION> will consider a worldwide ban on ivory imports at a <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> meeting in October. Conservationists feared that prospects of a worldwide ban could lead poachers to a frenzy of elephant killing unless interim measures were imposed by major importing countries now. Ivory is used for the signature stamps popular in many Asian nations, and for jewelry, piano keys and carvings. Though some African countries still permit limited exports of the certified ivory, four major producers _ <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tanzania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Gambia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Somalia </LOCATION> _ have called for a total ban on trade in ivory. They say such action is needed to stem the swift decline in the population of African elephants. <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>, which banned hunting of African elephants a decade ago, last year began using police and paramilitary units its war with poachers. An aerial survey last year found an estimated 20,000 elephants remaining in <LOCATION> Kenya </LOCATION>, which 15 years ago had a population of 121,000. Poachers have killed most of the big male elephants in some countries and are switching to females and young beasts, according to a conservationists' report this month based on material from biologists, conservationists, economists and trade specialists. As a result, three times as many elephants must be killed to provide the same amount of ivory as 10 years ago, the report said. Most ivory is added late in life among males. <PERSON> Tamotsu </PERSON> <PERSON> Ishibashi </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ivory </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Craft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cooperative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said the ban will hurt <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s traditional ivory-carving industry. `` The majority of ivory craftsmen have passed their techniques of carving ivory from generation to generation, and the new restriction certainly will affect them severely,'' Ishibashi said in a telephone interview. About 25,000 ivory craftsman work in 80 Japanese workshops, producing $ 13.8 million worth of ivory products every year.

<HEAD>Panel Seeks to Slow Medicare Growth with Rules Reforms</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DEBORAH MESCE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee approved legislation to considerably limit the ability of physicians to refer Medicare patients to laboratories or clinics in which the doctors have a financial interest. The measure is part of a package of nearly $ 3 billion in Medicare savings for fiscal 1990 that attempts to curb soaring growth in the program. It also includes a major overhaul of Medicare spending on physicians and an unprecedented cap on payments to doctors in the program. The package was approved 11-0 in a closed session Thursday night by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> health subcommittee and details were released Friday by the subcommittee staff. It now goes to the full committee. The physician ownership-referral measure, sponsored by Rep. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Stark </PERSON>, D-Calif., chairman of the subcommittee, would allow clinics and laboratories with physician ownership to continue operating, but they would have to register with the government They also would continue to be subject to current law, which bars direct payments for referrals. For new joint ventures, however, the bill would prohibit physicians from referring Medicare patients to a facility in which the doctor or an immediate family member has an ownership or investment interest. Exceptions could be made for a facility that could show it provides a service unavailable elsewhere. A report by the <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> Inspector General earlier this spring found that patients of physicians who have a financial stake in clinical labs received 45 percent more lab services than Medicare patients in general. Outlays under the federal health care program for the elderly would rise from $ 98.6 billion in the current fiscal year to $ 111 billion in the fiscal year that begins Oct. 1. Without the cutbacks, <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> would cost $ 114 billion next year. <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> spending has been increasing about 15 percent annually since 1980. <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, said this week that <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> spending on physicians has increased 16 percent annually over the past 10 years. Savings would be achieved by squeezing hospitals and physicians but leaving intact benefits for the 33 million people enrolled in the program. However, the subcommittee's package recognizes the current financial dilemma faced by many rural and urban hospitals. All hospitals would see an increase in <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> payments next year, under the panel's recommendation. However, rural and inner city hospitals would get larger increases than suburban hospitals. Physicians would also take a hit, with reimbursement for some medical procedures considered `` overpriced'' being cut by up to 15 percent. These procedures include coronary bypass surgery and cataract surgery. The physician payment overhaul was approved by the subcommittee on Wednesday with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration backing. The cornerstone of the plan is a national spending target that would limit Medicare payments to physicians. This feature is opposed by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which says it would ration health care. The two other parts of the plan would raise reimbursed charges for family practioners and internists while lowering them for surgeons, eye doctors and other specialty practices and limit the amount physicians can charge their Medicare patients beyond the reimbursed charge. <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> told a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee Thursday the administration supports the three elements of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee's package. But he said the administration would oppose a change in the physician fee schedule `` if it is not linked to a volume control mechanism such as an expenditure target.''

<HEAD>House Strips Exemptions From S&amp;L Bill but They're Not Dead Yet</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, operating under an ethics microscope, stripped special interest exemptions from a savings and loan bailout bill at the last minute, but they may resurface in an anticipated blitz by industry lobbyists. Before House members approved the $ 157 billion taxpayer-financed <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L rescue just before midnight Thursday, provisions aimed specifically at benefiting <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Citicorp </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Paine </PERSON> <PERSON> Webber </PERSON> and several other financial houses suddenly were removed. However, lawmakers and outside observers expect the provisions to come up again when <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> negotiators meet later this month to iron out differences between their two versions of the legislation. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approved its bill in April. `` It's so unlike the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to do something like that,'' <PERSON> Bert </PERSON> <PERSON> Ely </PERSON>, an independent consultant on the <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L industry, said of the 11th-hour removal of the provisions. `` But I know they're going to come back up in conference because the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> bill has a bunch of amendments like that.'' House Speaker <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, D-Wash., and Rep. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said Friday they hope to have the bill ready for President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s signature by July <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> experts who have examined the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> version say they count about 40 `` special interest'' provisions in it intended to benefit specific insurance companies, banks, <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls or other financial institutions. The biggest, according to Rep. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Leach </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Iowa </LOCATION>, is a provision that would allow <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, to exceed federal restrictions on how many high-risk, high-interest junk bonds S & amp; Ls can own. According to <PERSON> Leach </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> provision was inserted at the behest of <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, which has the largest portfolio of junk bonds of any S & amp; L in the country. <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> also was involved in the junk bond deal that helped bring about <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Democratic Whip <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>'s resignation. <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>, who left <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> Thursday, made about $ 6,880 in four months in 1986 after an executive of the <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L bought the bonds and held them for <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> until the congressman could raise the money, partly through a loan from the S & amp; <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Leach </PERSON>, a leading <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> proponent of making S & amp; Ls as well as banks and other financial institutions meet much stricter accountability standards, was the primary force behind knocking the special interest provisions out of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> bill. In a parliamentary move that caught both many Democrats and fellow Republicans by surprise, he asked _ minutes before lawmakers were scheduled to vote on final passage _ that the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> send the bill back to its <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> with instructions to immediately return it without the provisions he was opposing. `` Frankly, it was something that I had had in the back of my mind for three or four days,'' he said in an interview Friday. `` It's because of the greatest legislative lapse of this century that we have this problem If we're going to ask the public to pay for it to the tune of $ 500 for every man, woman and child, people here should make it clear there are no special benefits to the large and well-heeled. As the bill was structured when it went to the House floor, only Republicans were allowed to offer amendments weakening <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s demand for strong regulatory requirements. Under the debate procedure set by the Democratic-controlled <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rules </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, Democrats were allowed to introduce and pass several `` reform'' amendments. Among them were a measure opposed by <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's largest underwriter of junk bonds, to forbid all S & amp; L investments in the high-risk securities and a measure opposed by the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> to establish $ 1-million-a-day civil fines for bank fraud When the vote on <PERSON> Leach </PERSON>'s motion began, Republicans automatically supported it as a protest and Democrats at first voted against it. But soon Democrats started switching their votes. When the final vote was tabulated, <PERSON> Leach </PERSON> won 411-8. `` The sentiment among a lot of Democrats was that he was right,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, who had been criticized by members of both parties close to S & amp; L interests as being the `` administration's pawn'' in seeking tougher regulations on the industry. <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> called <PERSON> Leach </PERSON>'s use of the parliamentary tactic one of the most successful he had ever seen. <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> said Democrats had no choice but to go along with it so they could say, `` Look, we're on the high road, too. We're not for these special interests and giveaways.'' Democrats who had sponsored the special exemptions _ among them Reps. <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> <PERSON> Hubbard </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnard </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> _ `` did n't realize until it was too late'' what was happening, <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> said.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> unit set up six years ago to test weapons was criticized by a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> panel Friday for hiring defense contractors to do the tests. `` We wanted a tough junkyard dog who would stop bad weapons. However, what we seem to have created is just another layer to the Pentagon bureaucracy,'' Sen. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Pryor </PERSON>, D-Ark., said in prepared remarks at a hearing of a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Governmental Affairs subcommittee `` <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has been so disappointed in the testing office that some have spoken of eliminating it.' `` Six years after setting up the testing office, <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is still sending poorly tested weapons to the troops and spending billions due to misleading or incomplete test reports,'' he said. Rep. <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Boxer </PERSON>, D-Calif., added in a statement that `` it is no secret that the -LRB- testing -RRB- office has been a terrible disappointment to many members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The staff of the federal services subcommittee chaired by <PERSON> Pryor </PERSON> compiled a report on the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s Office of Operational Test and Evaluation, the top weapons testing office. Data came from the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, the congressional watchdog agency, from the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s inspector general, and from other sources. `` Contractors with ties to weapons being tested regularly review test plans, analyze test results and and prepare test reports,'' <PERSON> Pryor </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> TRW </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Applications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> or <ORGANIZATION> SAIC </ORGANIZATION> have been hired under an $ 85 million contract to provide a wide variety of technical support `` across the full spectrum of test and evaluation activity,'' the report said. <ORGANIZATION> TRW </ORGANIZATION> is the 11th largest weapons supplier to the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> and the fourth largest contractor working on the Strategic Defense Initiative, the report noted. The testing office insists that its staff is making all the decisions and the firms are merely providing support, but the report said <ORGANIZATION> TRW </ORGANIZATION> has `` contact with a wide variety of other DoD projects and contractors ... -LRB- and -RRB- it is difficult to understand how this firm can be used to perform objective, independent operational testing.'' At the <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> headquarters of <ORGANIZATION> TRW </ORGANIZATION>, the firm's media relations office said everyone who could comment was traveling. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Conahan </PERSON>, assistant comptroller general in the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, told the panel that `` testing has not been comprehensive, realistic or rigorous; nor has there been sufficient oversight of the testing and evaluation function by top management'' of the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. To improve testing, <PERSON> Conahan </PERSON> said officials in his agency `` strongly support the need for having some ... results available early in the acquisition process before production commitments are made.'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Krings </PERSON>, the head of the 50-person office who has announced he is retiring, defended the testing operation, saying the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> `` has made tremendous strides'' to ensure that equipment sent to the troops is safe and effective. He cited a number of cases in which organized tests have affected weapons, but he said some weapons ca n't be `` subjected to full up operational testing until a considerable monetary commitment has been made.'' <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has not always been forthcoming with the money, he said. While he praised the goal of an independent testing office, <PERSON> Krings </PERSON> said, `` The price of independence is a constant attack from those who would leave you independent from all but them.''

<TEXT>
 Premier <PERSON> Andreas </PERSON> <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> ended his election campaign with a giant rally Friday, urging 500,000 supporters to give his <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> another term to complete reforms begun eight years ago. Recent opinion polls have indicated, however, that the conservative <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> will get about 47 percent of the vote in Sunday's election, compared with 36 percent for the Socialists. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> said 25 parties are participating, including anarchists, fascists and the Coalition of the Left and Progress, a new alliance of the Moscow-oriented <ORGANIZATION> Greek </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Greek </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Left </ORGANIZATION> party that is the country's the third-largest political organization. If neither major party wins a majority in the 300-member unicameral parliament, the Coalition could become a power broker. Some polls give it 14 percent of the vote. Both New Democracy and the Socialists have said they would reject Communist support in forming a government. <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> told the cheering crowd in Constitution Square the Socialists need four more years to finish their tasks and prepare `` for the challenge in 1992,'' when <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> and the other 11 members of the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> drop internal economic barriers and become a single market. `` The four years leading to 1992 ... to a united <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, compels us to develop technology to a great degree,'' he said. People in the crowd waved flags of green, the party color, and sang along with music blaring from giant loudspeakers before <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON>, 70, appeared on a platform in front of the Unknown Soldiers Tomb. Approaching the platform, he was accompanied by his 35-year-old mistress, former airline hostess <PERSON> Dimitra </PERSON> <PERSON> Liani </PERSON>. <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> said they will marry soon. His divorce from his American-born wife <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> became final June 9, and on Friday their lawyers submitted the documents necessary for the <ORGANIZATION> Greek </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orthodox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> to end their 38-year marriage. Fireworks exploded above the square and lit up the darkened skies, giving the rally a carnival atmosphere. <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> shouted into the microphone, but the noise of the crowd drowned most of his speech. Departing from prepared remarks, the premier attacked <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION> and its leader, <PERSON> Constantine </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitsotakis </PERSON>. `` They can not defeat us with their slander and mudslinging,'' he said. The reference was to allegations that he and ranking members of his party were involved in a $ 200 million embezzlement scandal at the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crete </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> has denied any wrongdoing, but at least eight ministers in his adminstration have resigned, including Deputy Premier <PERSON> Agamemnon </PERSON> <PERSON> Koutsogiorgas </PERSON>. New Democracy finished its campaign Thursday night in the same square. No campaigning is permitted Saturday.

 Prosecutors trying to avoid a clash over national secrets said Friday they will narrow the Iran-Contra indictment against former <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> Adviser <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>, while <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>'s lawyer said he'll try to force President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to testify. Defense attorney <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Beckler </PERSON> said the government's plan to adjust but not drop a broad conspiracy charge `` does n't make any sense,'' but the judge said it depends on the specifics of the prosecution motion, which wo n't be submitted until next week. <PERSON> Beckler </PERSON> said he wants to subpoena <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> because <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> `` had substantial contact with both of these individuals throughout this offense as outlined in the indictment.'' Associate independent counsel <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> <PERSON> Mixter </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Greene </PERSON> that after the charges are narrowed `` there would be no reason to involve'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in the trial. Independent counsel <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said the prosecution will seek dismissal of theft and wire fraud charges, which deal with the diversion of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> arms-sale proceeds to the Nicaraguan rebels, and portions of the broad conspiracy charge against <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>. Later in the day, <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> filed a motion to dismiss the three charges against arms dealer <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>, who is scheduled to be tried separately in November. In court papers, <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said he wished to avoid the same legal fight over state secrets that loomed in the <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> case, particularly because of the reluctance of federal agencies to give <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> access to classified documents to prepare his defense. <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> is also charged with conspiring to pay an illegal gratuity to former White House aide <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON> by arranging to set up a $ 200,000 Swiss bank account for his children and by financing installation of a $ 13,800 security system outside <LOCATION> North </LOCATION>'s suburban <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> home. He also faces charges of lying to the 1987 congressional hearings on the Iran-Contra affair. The move to drop the major Iran-Contra charges against <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> foreshadows the ultimate dismissal of those counts against his former business partner, <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON>, who is also awaiting trial. After the <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> hearing, <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> indicated outside the courtroom that the government's motion would seek to preserve portions of a wide-ranging conspiracy charge dealing with obstruction of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Thus, the government appears prepared to scuttle the portion of the 38-page conspiracy count dealing with the diversion of profits to the Contras. <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said he is trying to avoid the kind of protracted battle over classified material that threatened to derail the prosecution of North. North, a former <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> aide, was convicted of three felonies in the Iran-Contra affair and faces sentencing next Friday. He tried unsuccessfully to require <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to testify at his trial. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> quashed subpoenas for both men. <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON> said that the trial record contained no proof <PERSON> North </PERSON> received authorization from <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to engage in illegal conduct, and that <PERSON> North </PERSON> failed to demonstrate that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who was <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s vice president, had any relevant information. However, <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>, unlike <PERSON> North </PERSON>, met daily with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, and so may have more solid legal grounds for asking the former president to testify. <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> said that if he attempts to prosecute the charges against <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> in their entirety, <PERSON> Greene </PERSON> might rule that vast amounts of now-classified material might be required at the trial. Objections by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence agencies to introducing such material led to scuttling of the entire conspiracy charge as well as the theft charge against <PERSON> North </PERSON>. <PERSON> Beckler </PERSON> expressed concern to <PERSON> Greene </PERSON> that <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> is n't planning to seek dismissal of the entire conspiracy charge against <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>. The lawyer suggested that <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> `` thinks he may be solving'' problems but that his move `` does n't make any sense.'' <PERSON> Greene </PERSON> responded that if <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> decides to drop 5 percent of the conspiracy count, then `` we have a big problem'' concerning the use of classified information. But if <PERSON> Walsh </PERSON> seeks dismissal of 95 percent of that count, there wo n't be a big problem, the judge added. The remaining four counts against <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON> accuse him of obstructing and making false statements to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in connection with <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s secret resupply operation for the Contras and a 1985 arms shipment to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Greene </PERSON> did n't set a trial date but did say he wanted to avoid November and December when <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> may go on trial.

 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> admitted for the first time Friday that a tank of radioactive waste exploded at a nuclear weapons plant nearly 32 years ago, showering particles over nearly 400 square miles and forcing 10,000 people to evacuate. Before the Chernobyl power plant explosion on April 26, 1986, Western specialists called the disaster in the southern <LOCATION> Ural </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> the world's worst nuclear accident. A secret <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> file made public in 1977 quoted Soviet sources as saying hundreds of people were killed. The Western accounts said the explosion created a vast radioactive wasteland one-third the land area of <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, or about 400 square miles. Thirty rural villages vanished from Soviet maps, fishing was banned in lakes, dams were built to contain radioactive waterways and rivers were diverted with canals, according to the Western accounts. But the official news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said Friday no casualities had resulted. It quoted <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> Nikipelov </PERSON>, first deputy minister for medium machine-building, as telling a news conference a `` chemical explosion'' occurred in September 1957 near <LOCATION> Kasli </LOCATION>, about 870 miles east of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. A tank of radioactive waste exploded at a military plant where atomic weapons were to be built, `` forming a radioactive trail 105 kilometers -LRB- 65 miles -RRB- long and 8 to 9 kilometers -LRB- roughly five to 5 -LCB- miles -RRB- wide,'' said <PERSON> Nikipelov </PERSON>, whose ministry administers military-related nuclear programs. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said 2 million curies of radioactive elements were released, and `` more than 10,000 people were urgently evacuated from the contaminated zone.'' In comparison, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> noted that 50 million curies of radiation were released in the Chernobyl explosion and fire in which 31 people were killed. The 1979 accident at <LOCATION> Three </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mile </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> power plant in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> released 14 curies, a measure of the amount of radioactivty contained in a material. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> analysts have calculated that the Urals accident spewed out more radiation than that produced by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> atomic bombing of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. The effects of the accident lasted for decades, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> indicated. It said economic activity resumed in the area only by 1978, and even then only in 80 percent of the contaminated zone. The remaining territory was turned into a reserve. Radiation returned to safe levels in the area only by 1974, and lakes and other waterways remain contaminated, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> did not say when or where <PERSON> Nikipelov </PERSON> gave the news conference, nor did it say which radioactive particles were released or whether the atomic weapons plant is still operating. Some Western reports have said the accident happened at the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s first nuclear production facility, in <LOCATION> Kyshtym </LOCATION>, about 20 miles south of <LOCATION> Kasli </LOCATION>. The complex or a replacement is believed to be still producing plutonium. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said the accident was kept secret so long in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> because it occurred at a military plant. President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policy of glasnost, or openness, has brought to light other disasters long hushed up. In April, a Soviet magazine reported for the first time that an ICBM exploded in 1960, killing the chief of Soviet rocket forces and incinerating many other people. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said disclosure about the 1957 accident `` poured oil onto the fire'' of a debate about building an atomic power plant in the southern Urals. <PERSON> Nikipelov </PERSON> defended the plant's construction, claiming it would help purify water contaminated by radiation by evaporating it. Since Chernobyl, Soviet public opinion has turned against harnessing the atom for electricity. Several nuclear power projects were canceled because of protests. The Urals accident was first disclosed in 1972, when <PERSON> Zhores </PERSON> <PERSON> Medvedev </PERSON>, a Soviet biochmist now living in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, wrote that hundreds of people probably died of radioactive poisoning after nuclear wastes near the first Soviet atomic power plants exploded. <PERSON> Lev </PERSON> <PERSON> Tumerman </PERSON>, a physicist who emigrated to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, said in a 1976 interview that he visited the area in the early 1960s and found it was `` empty land,'' almost like a lunar view. <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> documents say another nuclear accident, an explosion, occurred at <LOCATION> Kyshtym </LOCATION> in 1960 or 1961.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> called on <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> counterpart <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> on Friday to join him in writing an ethics code to steer politicians away from dirty campaigning. <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> said <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> should join him in supporting a proposal President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will soon send to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` American politics is in trouble,'' said <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, who was attending the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> Chairs summer meeting. `` Voters are sick and tired of attacks, dirty tricks, phony phone banks and rumor mongers.'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said he sent an invitation to <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> asking for a meeting as soon as possible. `` I believe the two major parties can make a difference by setting new standards of conduct in the profession of politics,'' he said. <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>, in a statement issued in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, did not refer directly to <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>'s call for a campaign code but said he would consider meeting with him if the Democratic chairman endorsed a campaign reform proposal <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is preparing to send to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. `` The best thing <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> and I can do is to work with our respective congressional delegations for quick passage of this legislation,'' <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> said. Democrats, however, are working on a campaign reform package of their own. <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> also said he would like any such meeting with <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> to include discussion of rules for congressional redistricting to take place following the 1990 census. Both parties are spending heavily trying to gain control of legislatures that will redraw congressional districts in states that lose or gain seats in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> because of population shifts. The indirect exchange between the party chairman came a week after <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> called for <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>'s resignation because of a <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> memo attacking new <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>. The memo compared <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>'s record with that of Rep. <PERSON> Barney </PERSON> <PERSON> Frank </PERSON>, D-Mass., who is homosexual <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodin </PERSON>, who sent the memo, resigned as <ORGANIZATION> RNC </ORGANIZATION> communications director and said <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> did not see the document in advance of its distribution. On Friday, <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> stood by his suggestion that <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> resign but said he also believed it important for the party chairmen to discuss campaign conduct. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> also said, `` President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has to step up and lead his troops. His troops are out of control. The <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leadership has become the princes of dirty politics, dirty practices and negative campaigning.'' He declined to say exactly which issues should be addressed in his proposed campaign code but said a non-partisan group probably would be needed to enforce any such guidelines.

<TEXT>
 A federal judge enjoined the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> on Friday from randomly checking 24 drivers and computer specialists for drug use, ruling the tests would be an unwarranted invasion of privacy. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pratt </PERSON> issued a preliminary injunction barring the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> from beginning the random drug testing program on Monday. But <PERSON> Pratt </PERSON> upheld the agency's plan to proceed Monday with the testing of employees suspected of using illegal drugs. `` Such testing shall be based on reasonable, articulable and individualized suspicion that a specific employee may be under the influence of drugs while on duty,'' <PERSON> Pratt </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Pratt </PERSON> issued the injunction in a lawsuit brought by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employees </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, which represents 2,200 <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> employees at the agency's <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> headquarters. <PERSON> Pratt </PERSON> rejected the government's contention that because the drivers and computer specialists handled classified documents they held sensitive positions that would subject them to random drug testing. The judge noted that these employees `` have never been subjected to ongoing security checks or strict job controls once their security clearance has been determined.'' `` They are not required to routinely disclose information concerning their medical or financial circumstances and are not required to undergo routine physical examinations for work,'' <PERSON> Pratt </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Pratt </PERSON> also noted a `` complete absence of any history of drug-related accidents, safety violations or a single incident of blackmail or bribery involving employees in these positions.'' <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Amy </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said government attorneys are `` reviewing the opinion and studying our options.'' The lawsuit is one of a series brought by various employee organizations following then-President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s `` drug-free workplace'' initiative. Federal court orders enjoining random drug testing of <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> attorneys and civilian <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> employees are being reviewed by a federal appeals court here.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> proposed $ 1.13 million in civil penalties against <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Friday because the company allegedly failed to promptly inform the agency it was manufacturing a new chemical substance Such notification is required under federal toxic substances control laws.

The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> said Dow, based in <LOCATION> Midland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, accumulated 227 separate violations because of the reporting lapses involving the new chemical product, a clear plastic called polycarbonate.

<HEAD>Bush Sends Negotiators To Reopen Arms Talks With Soviets</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BARRY SCHWEID</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Diplomatic Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has decided against major shifts in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> negotiating position when talks resume next week with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to reduce long-range nuclear weapons arsenals by up to 50 percent. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said Friday there would be only `` relatively minor changes'' from the stand the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration took at the bargaining table in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> before negotiations were suspended seven months ago. `` The previous administration left an excellent foundation on which to build,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> convened a meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday before formulating instructions to <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Burt </PERSON> and <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>, who head the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> delegation for the strategic arms reduction and space-defense talks. Among the items the president took up with his key advisers was whether to shift the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> position on mobile missiles. The chairmen of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Armed Services committees, Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, D-Ga., and Rep. <PERSON> Les </PERSON> <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Wis </LOCATION>., wanted to push for a ban on mobiles with multiple The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> position in the talks last year was that all mobile missiles should be outlawed until ways are found to keep track of them and make sure any negotiated reductions are carried out. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said that remained the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> position in the negotiations with the Soviets. But he stressed that on mobile missiles and other weapons questions, `` we do reserve the right to review these matters and make changes on an ongoing basis.'' Overall, the spokesman said, ` ` there will be a considerable degree of continuity in the approach of this administration. While the talks formally reopen on Monday, negotiations do not begin until Wednesday. That leaves time for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to make changes in the instructions he gave to <PERSON> Burt </PERSON> and <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>. But a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said he did not expect the president to revise the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> position in the days ahead. The talks are aimed at reducing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet long-range bombers, land-based missiles and nuclear submarines by 30 percent to 50 percent. Earlier, a senior administration official also said the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> team is taking an optimistic view about the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION>'s approach to the negotiations. The official said the Soviets `` have indicated in their rhetoric ... they are eager to get back to talks and that they have a positive attitude. We'll see.'' When the negotiations were suspended last November, about 90 percent of the work was completed. The talks have been on hold ever since as <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> took office and ordered a review of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy on national security issues. The unfinished 10 percent of the agreement contains some of the thorniest issues, such as weapons ceilings, limits on air - and sea-launched cruise missiles, verification, and how to deal with mobile missiles A senior <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> official told reporters that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> negotiators would seek to turn the talks immediately to verification issues. `` Intead of treating verification as the caboose on the train, and treating it at the end or after the end, during ratification debates, I think that we will probably see an effort to bring that to a higher priority and get serious movement going on things that could substantially advance our ability to verify this agreement when it is done,'' said the official, speaking on condition that he not be further identified. The Intermediate Nuclear Force Treaty, ratified by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> last year, drew complaints from some senators that it would be hard to verify, although it allows unprecedented on-site inspection of Soviet and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military sites. Of particular concern under the proposed START treaty, said the official, was the ability of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to verify the number of Soviet mobile missiles. The Soviets have fielded two such systems, the SS-24 and the SS-25, whereas the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has not yet developed one. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has asked <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to provide money for two mobile missiles, a rail-based MX, with 10 warheads, and the so-called Midgetman, with one or two warheads. `` Whether under START it's going to be more desirable to permit mobiles or to continue to seek the ban on them is something that we may not be able to determine'' until the verification issue is settled, said the official. When the arms talks resume, parallel talks will begin again on space-based defenses against ballistic missile attacks. Both the senior officials who spoke to reporters said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` has indicated he is not going to make a 90-degree change in direction.''

 Governing parties in the 12 <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> nations will lose ground in the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> if results in seven member states that vote Sunday match those of the five that voted Thursday. Unofficial projections of Thursday's ballotting in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> showed gains for opposition candidates, with conservative parties often the main losers. The <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- Common Market -RRB- nations to vote Sunday on the 518-seat <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> are <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Luxembourg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. Official results from Thursday's balloting will not be released until voting has been completed Sunday. Exit polls and other surveys indicated this voter swing Thursday: <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> _ The opposition <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> trounced Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> which has been in power for a decade. A <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> poll gave <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> 51 of the 78 seats allotted to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and the Conservatives 26. Labor had held 32 and the Conservatives 45. <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> _ Prime Minister <PERSON> Felipe </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> will lose 2 of its 28 seats in the <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> has 60 seats. The conservative <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> also lost 2 seats, dropping to 15, as did the centrist <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> losing 2 and holding 5. A Communist-led coalition won 4 seats, 1 more than it had. Several other parties made slight gains. <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION> _ Prime Minister <PERSON> Poul </PERSON> <PERSON> Schlueter </PERSON>'s Conservatives may lose 2 of its 4 seats with the Socialists going from 3 to 5 seats. <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION> is allotted 16 seats in the <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Strasbourg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. The People's Movement Against the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION>, which wants a referendum on <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>'s membership, lost at least 1 of its 4 seats, according to the polls. Other seats were scattered among various parties and coalitions. The <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION> _ Prime Minister <PERSON> Ruud </PERSON> <PERSON> Lubbers </PERSON> and his <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> gained 1 seat for a total of 9 but their conservative coalition partners lost 2 of their 5 seats and the Socialists held all 9 seats. <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> _ It has 15 seats in the Parliament but the ballots are not be counted until Sunday and the news media did not carry predictions. Polls indicated that when all of the elections are complete the Socialists, with 166 seats, will strengthen their dominant position. The centrist <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> hold 112 seats and also were expected to gain. <PERSON> Green </PERSON> and environmental parties, with 20 seats, also should do well, especially in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. Conservative parties were expected to suffer the losses. Thursday's turnout generally was low, though turnouts for the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> usually are. It was 35 percent in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, compared to 32.5 percent in 1984; the <ORGANIZATION> Netherlands </ORGANIZATION> 48 percent, down from 51 percent five years ago; <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION> dropped to 46 percent from 52.4 percent in 1984, and <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> recorded 65 percent compared to 69 percent in 1987 when elections were held there and in <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>. The two nations joined the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> in 1986. Polls have consistently shown that the Parliament's role in <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> affairs is largely unknown to most of the people in the 12 nations. As a result, the election campaigns are dominated by national rather than pan-European issues. The <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> meets one week per month in <LOCATION> Strasbourg </LOCATION>.

 A <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> spokesman on Friday said the party will need to institute reform to overcome its stinging defeats in democratic parliamentary elections earlier this month. His pledge followed a party pep talk given by Prime Minister <PERSON> Mieczyslaw </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON>, himself a loser in the June 4 elections. <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> analyzed the losses in preparation for the second round of voting Sunday. <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Bisztyga </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s policy-making <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, told a news conference: `` We are aware that increased social support for the party in the future, especially support by youth, must be linked with further democratization of the system and economic reforms.'' In other developments Friday: _ A small band of young protesters shouting anti-Soviet slogans from the steps of a <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> church hurled gasoline-filled bottles toward police, who detained several before the demonstration dispersed without further incident and apparently without injuries _ President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> called <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> leaders courageous patriots for their recent steps toward democracy and reiterated a promise of economic aid as he ended a three-day state <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> acknowledged in a televised speech to <LOCATION> Wroclaw </LOCATION> party members Thursday night that the party underestimated the vigor of the Solidarity-led opposition's campaign and was too slow to shed Stalinism in favor of reform. The speech followed intensive consultations within the party leadership and the rank-and-file members after the setback suffered in the June 4 elections, the most democratic in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> since World War II. `` Counting on favorable results in the first round of the elections proved to be a mistake,'' he said. `` Could this have been avoided? In part yes, if we would have noticed the threatening dangers, but we did not notice them.'' Sunday's runoff is for candidates who failed to receive majorities on June 4. Most of the races will be for seats reserved for the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> or its allies in the Sejm, or parliament. Candidates of the independent Solidarity movement won all but one of the 161 seats open to the opposition in the 460-member parliament. They won 92 of the 100 seats in the new, freely elected <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, with the remaining eight to be decided Sunday. Only three party coalition <ORGANIZATION> Sejm </ORGANIZATION> candidates _ reformers supported by Solidarity activists in their regions _ won first-round victories. And 33 of the 35 top government officials on a `` national list'' of unopposed Sejm candidates did not receive the required 50 percent of votes cast. The defeated <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> says he will not run again for parliament Sunday under a plan worked out with the opposition to fill the 33 seats and maintain an agreed-upon 65 percent <ORGANIZATION> Sejm </ORGANIZATION> majority for the Communist coalition. However, he left open the possibility of continuing as prime minister, which is possible under Polish law. The new government and possible changes in party leadership are expected to be the main topic at a party plenum this month. The party is expected to confirm Gen. <PERSON> Wojceich </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> as its candidate for president, a new post to be filled by the vote of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and the Sejm. The president is to name the new prime minister. The plenum will `` deeply'' analyze the electoral defeat, <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Rakowski </PERSON> said public dissatisfaction with the government and living conditions `` has made many Poles judge us one-sidedly and to pin exaggerated hopes on the opposition.'' He said the `` aggressiveness'' of the opposition's campaign took many party leaders by surprise, according to a translation provided by the state-run <ORGANIZATION> PAP </ORGANIZATION> news agency.

<TEXT>
 Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> said Friday his <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> troops will attack Syrian supply routes in retaliation for the shelling of a tanker carrying gasoline destined for <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s besieged Christian enclave Syrian artillery fire set the tanker ablaze Thursday evening as it approached the Christian port of <LOCATION> Tabarja </LOCATION>, 15 miles north of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. `` Roads leading to capitals of occupation -LRB- forces -RRB- will not be safe henceforth,'' <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> said in a statement broadcast by government radio. `` We shall confront this foreign enemy with the courage of a warrior at the front.'' <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s 40,000 soldiers in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> receive supplies over a network of roads from <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Syrian </LOCATION> capital about 50 miles east of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. Attacks on the roads would be a dramatic escalation of the 3-month-old confrontation between <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s forces and a Moslem alliance of the Syrians and Druse militiamen, which has largely consisted of artillery duels. At least 372 people have been killed and 1,450 wounded since the fighting began March 8, two days after <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s Christian army units blockaded illegal ports operated by Moslem militias. The general describes the Syrians as an occupation force and has declared a `` war of liberation.'' President <PERSON> Hafez </PERSON> <PERSON> Assad </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> has had soldiers in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> since 1976, the year after the Lebanese civil war began, under a peacekeeping mandate from the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>. Christian gunners have shelled the supply routes several times in recent weeks, mainly in the Syrian-controlled <LOCATION> Bekaa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> east </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> did not say what other methods of attack he might use, but commando raids, land mines and car bombs are among the possibilities. Syrian forces have blockaded the 310-square-mile enclave where 1 million Christians live since the early days of the confrontation, and shell the Christian-held coast north of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> to stop supplies arriving by sea. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>'s gunboats tried in vain to salvage some of the 660,000 gallons of gasoline from the tanker. The vessel still was burning on Friday. Gunboats rescued 13 of the 14 crew members after they abandoned ship and the other man is missing and presumed dead, police reported. Syrian shellfire destroyed fuel depots in the Christian enclave March 30, creating a fuel shortage that has grown more acute. Dozens of small cargo ships carrying supplies and weapons provided by <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s main Arab rival, have reached Christian ports successfully but others either have been hit by Syrian fire or turned back because of it. The tanker was shelled several hours after three Lebanese cargo vessels used to run food supplies to the Christians were blown up in the port of <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION>, 25 miles south of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION> is predominantly Sunni Moslem. The Sunnis have stayed out of the fighting and merchants in <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION> have been shipping food to the Christian ports by night. A cease-fire proclaimed by the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> in April has been violated regularly. <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s government and army have been split on sectarian lines since a political crisis arose last September. At the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> on Friday, <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> protested <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> air raids, even as <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> conducted another raid against a Palestinian guerrilla base. <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s permanent <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> representative, <PERSON> Rachid </PERSON> <PERSON> Fakhoury </PERSON>, protested a raid on Wednesday against <PERSON> Bshamun </PERSON>, southeast of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, in which he said several people were killed or wounded. <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> warplanes Friday attacked targets at <LOCATION> Rashidiyeh </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Police said two children were wounded in a house near the beachside guerrilla base of <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> terrorist leader <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Fatah-Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, exercising its authority under the Voting Rights Act of 1965, objected Friday to state legislation creating two judicial circuits and 48 <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> judgeships in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>. The objection renders the judgeships `` null and void,'' said <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilde </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> attorney. An <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> lawsuit challenging <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>'s method of election of all <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> judges as racially discriminatory is pending in federal court. The Voting Rights Act requires that <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> and other Southern states submit all voting or election changes to the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, which must determine that the changes have neither a racially discriminatory purpose or effect before they can take effect. The 48 judgeships covered by the department's objection Friday _ out of 137 total <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> judgeships in the state _ were created since passage of the Voting Rights Act in 1965, Ms. <PERSON> Wilde </PERSON> said <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Burstion-Wade </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the civil rigts division of the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, had no immediate comment on the department's action. But <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> Attorney General <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowers </PERSON> said he had been notified of the department's objection and was studying it. `` I'm not sure what this means,'' he said. Ms. <PERSON> Wilde </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s objection was based on <PERSON> Bower </PERSON>'s refusal to provide the department with requested information on the racial makeup of the new judicial districts. The lawsuit pending in <LOCATION> Brunswick </LOCATION> challenges the at-large method <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> uses to elect <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> judges. In an at-large election, two or more judges are chosen by the voters of an entire jurisdiction created by the state.

 The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration has granted refuge to at least two more Chinese diplomats based in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> sources said Friday. Earlier this week, two diplomats in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> announced they intended to defect. Confirmation of the action came as nearly 100 more people were arrested in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> for taking part in pro-democracy protests and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s leaders increased efforts to absolve the government in the deaths of protesters. Also, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> action occurred as Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> worked to resolve a standoff with the Chinese over the decision to shelter Chinese dissident <PERSON> Fang </PERSON> <PERSON> Lizhi </PERSON> in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. A <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said that besides the two Chinese diplomats in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, `` there have been additional Chinese officials who have asked for protection in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' Any Chinese official who does seek to remain in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will be allowed to do so, the official said. The official said the Chinese diplomats involved have not formally asked for asylum, but could do so in the future. He refused to give a specific number who have sought refuge, nor to confirm a report that a husband and wife, both diplomats in the <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, were the diplomats in question. <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>, quoting unidentified Chinese and diplomatic sources, identified the two Friday night as <PERSON> Han </PERSON> <PERSON> Guohong </PERSON>, secretary to the ambassador, and her husband <PERSON> Zhang </PERSON> <PERSON> Chiwei </PERSON>, an attache in the press office at the embassy in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Rains Soak the Southeast</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 The rains that never came last year pelted the Southeast with a vengeance as record storms soaked farmers' fields, washed out roads and sent some people searching for higher ground Friday. Rivers driven up by as much as 14 feet forced officials to close several highways throughout <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and to evacuate the town of <LOCATION> Dunlow </LOCATION>, with <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> workers kept out until late afternoon by high waters. Showers and thunderstorms continued into the afternoon from the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> panhandle and northern <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> across <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> panhandle. Rainshowers and thunderstorms developed over <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> and rain was scattered over northern <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>. Severe thunderstorm watches were posted over portions of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, eastern <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Delaware </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, eastern <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, southeast <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state, southwest <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> and northern and central <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. There were flood watches in parts of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> and much of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Montgomery </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, where 6 inches of rain fell in four days, firefighters had to use a boat Friday to rescue a bed-ridden woman and four children from a wood-frame house. The home, flooded knee-deep in water, was located in a low-lying area. In <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, authorities said several bridges washed out along dirt roads, and one road was under water. A section of Mobile's <LOCATION> Battleship </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Parkway </LOCATION> was closed for about three hours because of water over the road. Tree limbs downed by storms during the evening rush hour Friday in <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, created havoc with traffic and knocked out power. During the morning, wind gusts toppled a tree onto a mobile home at <LOCATION> Kinsey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>.

 The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> issued a travel alert Friday to call attention to stepped-up anti-terrorist precautions at <LOCATION> Frankurt </LOCATION> airport in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and the conclusion of authorities there that terrorist attacks `` can not be ruled out.'' The department did not advise travelers to avoid the airport, believed by many investigators to have been the place where a bomb was placed on the Pan American jetliner that exploded over <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> in December with 270 deaths. The alert quoted from a statement issued by German officials from the state of <LOCATION> Hesse </LOCATION>, which said: `` Security measures at <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> airport remain at a high level. This is primarily due to the aggravated situation in the Arab region. Terrorist actions, especially in the area of the <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> airport, can not be ruled out. The security measures tie in with an investigative proceeding against a terrorist organization which has become active in the <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> area.'' In a similar announcement Tuesday, police in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> said they were searching for Palestinian terrorists who might be planning attacks in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> Kraus </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> police spokesman, said the search and security alert was linked to `` recent activities of terror groups in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>'' and there appeared to be a connection with the conviction of <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> hijacker <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>, a Lebanese Shiite Moslem, was sentenced to life in prison after being convicted by a <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> court in May on charges of air piracy and murder in the 1985 <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> hijacking. A <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> diver was killed and 39 Americans were held for 17 days during the ordeal. Federal prosecutors have said they believe the suspected terrorists to be members of a group called the <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palestine-General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>. The Syrian-supported group has been mentioned as a prime suspect in the bombing of <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> Flight 103. Police raids last October uncovered weapons and explosives and 14 Palestinians were arrested. Warrants have since been issued for four of the suspects. <PERSON> Kraus </PERSON> said police suspect other members of the group are still at large in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>.

 About 7,500 people were evacuated from their homes and businesses for about three hours Friday while authorities burned nine cases of old dynamite found by a warehouse cleanup crew. The evacuees included 4,000 employees at <ORGANIZATION> Goodyear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Rubber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. In addition, 150 residents of the <LOCATION> Middlebury </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Manor </LOCATION> nursing home were taken to two high schools and hospitals, said police Capt. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitmire </PERSON>. Workers at <ORGANIZATION> Guran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Concrete </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Supply </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> found 450 sticks of dynamite after prying off the lid of a container in a warehouse, said fire Capt. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Robles </PERSON>. Authorities were alerted about 11 a.m. The evacuation was ordered about an hour later when the bomb crew decided the best way to handle the dynamite was to slowly burn it in a dirt bunker, <PERSON> Robles </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Elmer </PERSON> <PERSON> Guran </PERSON>, one of the company's owners, said the dynamite had been in the warehouse for about 20 years but was not sure where it came from. `` From what we can tell it was part of an acquisition of a construction company that went bankrupt in 1969,'' said The dynamite was burned shortly after 3 p.m. Flames shot 15-20 feet high, but there was no explosion. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Testa </PERSON>, deputy fire chief, said the evacuation was necessary because there was a small chance of an explosion. `` You hate to do some of the things necessary, but you are dealing with people's lives,'' he said. The evacuation order took in a mostly industrial but partly residential area within 2,000 feet of the dynamite. It also shut down an <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Edison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> substation, cutting power to 4,170 residential and business customers, said spokesman <PERSON> Bud </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>. In addition, natural gas service in the neighborhood was shut off, officials said. `` Everything went amazingly well,'' said <PERSON> Sue </PERSON> <PERSON> Gregg </PERSON>, administrator of the nursing home, although some of the patients did n't want to go. When they got to the high school, they had lunch and a singalong, she said. The evacuation was the second in <LOCATION> Akron </LOCATION> this year. About 2,000 residents were evacuated following a chemical train derailment Feb. 26. It also was the second time in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> since 1986 that residents had to be evacuated because of dynamite. In October 1986, about 1,700 residents of <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>' east side were forced to flee their homes temporarily after employees of a storage company found a dozen 50-pound cases of unstable dynamite in a locker. Burning that dynamite without moving it caused about $ 40,000 in damage. The owner of the <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION> dynamite, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rieder </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, was sentenced to six months in prison, fined $ 1,000 and ordered to make restitution.

<HEAD>EPA Staff Recommends Ocean Dumping Permits, With Restrictions</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The staff of the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> recommended Friday that permits be issued to nine <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City-area </LOCATION> municipalities which dump treated sewage sludge in the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION>. An <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> hearing officer said authorities should be allowed to increase dumping sewage to five times their normal rates under bad weather, up to 15,500 gallons per minute. The report also recommends creating two barge tracks inside the dumping area, rather than the current single track, enabling more barges to use the dump site simultaneously. The permits would also reduce the time and distance that must remain between barges. `` I believe that these modifications ... while continuing to provide for maximum protection of the marine environment, result in a permit which is fully implementable,'' <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> hearing officer <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Caspe </PERSON> said in his report. `` I do not foresee any environmental condition which would result in its impracticability or its lack of environmental protection.'' The permits, which would be valid until March 17, 1991, must be approved by the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> regional administrator, said <PERSON> Herman </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>, an agency spokesman in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Currently, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Westchester </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nassau </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Counties </LOCATION>, and six sewerage authorities in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> dump more than 8 million wet tons of sewage sludge annually at a site 106 miles off the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> coast. They are the only municipalities in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> that dump sewage sludge in the ocean. The municipalities have been dumping under a court order issued in 1981, but the Ocean Dumping Ban Act of 1988 makes such dumping illegal after Aug. 14, 1989 unless the municipality has entered into an agreement with the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> to phase out the practice.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> objected Friday to <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> laws that created two judicial circuits and 48 elected <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> judgeships over the past 24 years. The action was disclosed in a letter to state officials from <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>, an acting assistant attorney general in the civil rights division. Under the 1965 Civil Rights Act, the objection renders the laws legally unenforceable until the department's objection is withdrawn or overturned in court But <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Burstion-Wade </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the civil rights division, said the department's objection does not prevent the 48 sitting judges from continuing to fulfill their duties, nor does it provide a basis for challenging their past decisions. The Voting Rights Act requires that <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> and other Southern states submit all voting or election changes to the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, which must determine that the changes have neither a racially discriminatory purpose nor effect before they can take effect. The 48 judgeships covered by the department's objection Friday _ out of 137 total <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> judgeships in the state _ all were created since passage of the Voting Rights Act. But the state of <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> did not submit any of the 48 judgeships to the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> for approval until after a 1986 <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling made it clear that the creation of elected judgeships was an election change covered by the Voting Rights Act. <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> said in the letter that the department's objection was based on the refusal of state officials to respond to requests for additional information needed to determine if the new judgeships and judicial circuits were free from racial discrimination. <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> said, however, that the department is `` ready and willing to reconsider'' its objection if the state provides the requested information on the racial makeup of the new judicial districts and the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>'s rationale for creating them. <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> Attorney General <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Bowers </PERSON> said he was studying <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>'s letter. `` I'm not sure what this means,'' he said. <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilde </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> attorney whose lawsuit challenging <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>'s method of election of all <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> judges as racially discriminatory is pending in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Brunswick </LOCATION>, said the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> action `` will strengthen my hand.''

 Prime Minister <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Haughey </PERSON> appeared to fall short in his fifth attempt to achieve a majority for hs party in parliamentary elections, state television said Saturday. The real surprises were the surge of the left, with gains for the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, and the collapse of the center-right Progressive Democratic party, the electoral partner of Fine Gael. Computer projections for the RTE network indicated that in Thursday's election <PERSON> Haughey </PERSON>'s Fianna Fail party won no more than 77 seats, a loss of three from its position when the Dail -LRB- parliament -RRB- was dissolved in May. Ballot boxes were opened Friday morning, and by early Saturday 122 seats had been decided: Fianna Fail 55, Fine Gael 38, <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> 12, Progressive Democrats 4, <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> 7, <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> 1, <ORGANIZATION> Green </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> 1, independent and others 4. <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Garland </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Green </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> winner, was the first of his party to win a seat in the Dail. If <PERSON> Haughey </PERSON> forms a coalition it would be the first time since 1969 that an Irish government won a second term. `` One of the disappointing things is that Irish politics may now become polarized between right and left,'' said <PERSON> Des </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Malley </PERSON>, the Progressive Democrat leader who won re-election. `` I think that would be a great pity.'' Fianna Fail's general secretary, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Wall </PERSON>, conceded that the best his party could do would be 82 seats, one short of a majority. `` Mr. <PERSON> Haughey </PERSON> is now a five-time loser,'' Fine <PERSON> Gael </PERSON> party leader <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukes </PERSON> declared. Fianna Fail won 81 seats in 1987 and held 80 when the Dail was dissolved. Fine <PERSON> Gael </PERSON> got 51 seats in 1987, <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> 12, the Progressive Democrats 14, <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> 4 and others 4. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Lenihan </PERSON> of Fianna Fail was the first confirmed winner. He missed the campaign to undergo a liver transplant at the Mayo Clinic in <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, but easily held his district in <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Haughey </PERSON> swept to a predictable victory in his own <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION> constituency. In <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>'s complicated election system, a quota is set in each constituency for the number of votes needed for election. Voters mark their ballots in order of preference, up to five choices. If no candidate reaches the quota, the vote `` transfers'' to the voter's second choice, and so on. About 77 percent of the 2.4 million eligible voters turned out Thursday in hot sunshine. <PERSON> Haughey </PERSON>, 63, has failed in four elections since 1979 to win a majority, relying on the support of splinter groups and independents. He called the latest election three years ahead of schedule when his poll ratings were high and he sensed a chance for a majority, but his ratings have dropped since. Despite his lack of a majority in the last parliament, <PERSON> Haughey </PERSON> was able to implement a sweeping austerity program to ease the country's debt and bring down interest rates.

 A union leader said Friday he was tortured by police agents who held him captive for four days and threatened to kill him if he reported the incident. <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Tomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazariego </PERSON>, a leader of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Salvadoran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION>, said he was seized Monday after he left the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> where he went to pick up a visa for a trip to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. He was released Thursday night. A communique issued by the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION>, an agency that deals with security, confirmed <PERSON> Mazariego </PERSON> had been detained and said he suffered slight injuries while resisting police who took him into custody. <PERSON> Mazariego </PERSON>, who sought the visa after he was invited to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to address several union meetings, gave this account of his detainment in an interview with The Associated Press: After he left the embassy accompanied by a friend `` I noticed they -LRB- police -RRB- followed me in two cars. `` Armed men with rifles and dressed in civilian clothing detained me violently and fired at my companion, who tried to impede the capture. ... They did not identify themselves and hit me when I protested.'' `` After they captured me they blindfolded my eyes and I stayed that way the whole time. They put a hood on me and kicked me in the knees and the feet. `` They wanted to apply electric shock, but the apparatus did n't work and they kicked me again I hurt all over.'' He showed the bruises on his legs. He was not allowed to sleep and his captors `` tried to get me to admit participation in attacks by urban guerrillas of the <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Farabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>.'' The <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION> is a coalition of leftist groups battling the U.S.-backed government. The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> communique said <PERSON> Mazariego </PERSON> was questioned about belonging to a rebel organization and claimed he is a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION>. That group purportedly is a branch of the <ORGANIZATION> Salvadoran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and one of the armed organizations in the <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION>. The communique said <PERSON> Mazariego </PERSON> has been under investigation since 1987. <PERSON> Mazariego </PERSON> said that while he was being interrogated and beaten, the police agents told him `` the former government was too slow and with the arrival of -LRB- President <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON>, they now have complete license to finish with all the unions, which they called facades for the <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION>.'' <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON>, leader of the conservative <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>, was installed in office June 1 after his party defeated the incumbent <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> in the March elections. <PERSON> Mazariego </PERSON> said the police agents tried to link the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Salvadoran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>'s largest labor organization, with the <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION> and asked him about three union leaders, <PERSON> Humberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Centeno </PERSON>, <PERSON> Marco </PERSON> <PERSON> Tulio </PERSON> <PERSON> Lima </PERSON> and <PERSON> Julio </PERSON> <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> <PERSON> Portillo </PERSON>. He said the `` torturers'' told him <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Centeno </PERSON> `` should not still be alive ... and when an opportune times, they -LRB- police -RRB- will act.'' <PERSON> Mazariego </PERSON> said when the blindfold was removed and he was freed his captors told him he would be killed if he made any complaint. <PERSON> Denys </PERSON> <PERSON> Everingham </PERSON> of Local 1034 of the <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Trenton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, said Tuesday that <PERSON> Mazariego </PERSON> had been scheduled to speak at a union meeting in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> on Thursday.

 More than 20,000 coal miners in six states stayed off the job Friday in an expanding wildcat strike that one union official said was being directed by <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Trumka </PERSON>. Miners in <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> joined the walkout, which began Monday in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> in sympathy with 1,600 miners on strike in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> against The <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> officials gave conflicting indications of whether they are responsible for the wildcat strike, which the companies say violates the 1988 national contract the union signed with the <ORGANIZATION> Bituminous </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Operators </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. In <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, 2,300 miners were on strike, less than 14 percent of the state's total. <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> 2 President <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> <PERSON> Molnar </PERSON> said union officials planned to tell each of the district's 52 local unions by telegram that their members should report to work as usual. <PERSON> Molnar </PERSON> said he could not predict whether the miners would obey. But in <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, District 20 international executive board member <PERSON> Tommy </PERSON> <PERSON> Buchanan </PERSON> said the final decision on whether <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> miners will join the strike will be with <PERSON> Trumka </PERSON>. `` It might be two days. It might be a week. It will start whenever it comes down from the union president,'' <PERSON> Buchanan </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Buchanan </PERSON> said earlier there is a `` 100 percent chance of a sympathy strike'' by the district's 5,000 members. <PERSON> Trumka </PERSON> did not return telephone calls Friday. <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Corcoran </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> was not in his office and has not returned phone calls this week. About 5,000 miners on Friday attended a rally in <LOCATION> Ebensburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, near <LOCATION> Johnstown </LOCATION>. Meanwhile, in <LOCATION> Hazleton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, union officials organized miners who could leave on short notice from <LOCATION> Trumka </LOCATION> to picket in support of the <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> strikers, said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Ray </PERSON>, District 25 president and an acting member of the union's international executive board. The walkout has affected about two-thirds of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>'s 24,000 miners, industry officials estimated, including 2,500 <ORGANIZATION> Consolidation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> miners and 1,000 <ORGANIZATION> Island </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Creek </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> employees Some non-union mines and coal-related businesses, including barge-loading docks and power plants, also were hit by bands of roving pickets. About 650 <ORGANIZATION> Westmoreland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> workers went back to work in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> Friday, but about 790 <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Creek </LOCATION> miners went on strike in that state at the same time, company spokesmen said. <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> has about 12,000 miners. About 200 Consolidation miners at <ORGANIZATION> Arco </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, joined the strike on Friday, a company spokesman said. At least 1,390 workers were off the job Friday at seven <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> mines. <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> Local 5179 leaders ordered workers to return to their jobs at <ORGANIZATION> Old </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ben </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s No. 1 mine near <LOCATION> Spurgeon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, during a meeting Friday, but local president <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Griffith </PERSON> said he was unsure whether workers would obey the order. Company officials also refused to comment. <PERSON> Lester </PERSON> <PERSON> Weist </PERSON>, chairman of the local's mine committee, said the members were ordered back to work because the work stoppage violates the contract. `` No local issues are involved,'' he said. `` The stoppage was not initiated on the local level, and at this point we're unsure of what level it was initiated.'' He said union members on the midnight shift apparently received phone calls that they were on strike until further notice. In Terre Haute, <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> 11 spokesman <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> television program `` 48 Hours,'' whose program Thursday night focused on the <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> strike, apparently sparked the <PERSON> Spurgeon </PERSON> miners to walk off the job. About 290 miners at <ORGANIZATION> Peabody </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holding </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s Camp No. 1 mine in <LOCATION> Morganfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, did n't report for work Friday, company spokesman <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Clarke </PERSON> said, but they represent less than 1 percent of the state's 32,000 miners. The largest contingent of striking miners in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> was at the <ORGANIZATION> Rochester </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> operations in central <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, where 1,600 workers failed to show up, company spokesman <PERSON> Hank </PERSON> <PERSON> Waneck </PERSON> said. The original strike by <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> miners began in April when <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> dropped out of the <ORGANIZATION> Bituminous </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Operators </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> to negotiate with the union independently. The two sides have failed to reach an agreement despite 16 months of negotiations.

 Israeli troops shot and killed three Arabs and wounded at least 13 in clashes in <LOCATION> Rafah </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> Friday, and soldiers used rubber bullets and clubs to curb a riot outside a <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> prison, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said. The army said it was investigating events in the occupied territory. It confirmed one death but said it had no information about the other two. In the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Tulkarem </LOCATION>, masked youths Friday attacked a fellow Palestinian accused of collaborating with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, stabbing him with a knife and firebombing his car, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> news reports said. The army confirmed that <PERSON> Bassam </PERSON> <PERSON> Akhras </PERSON>, 26, was slightly wounded. The 18-month revolt against <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation has killed 520 Palestinians and 22 Israelis. Army Chief of Staff <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Shomron </PERSON> said on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has the military force to quell the uprising but will not resort to extreme measures to end the violence. Israeli columnist <PERSON> Zeev </PERSON> <PERSON> Schiff </PERSON> wrote in the <ORGANIZATION> Haaretz </ORGANIZATION> daily on Friday that right-wing politicians have pressured the army to adopt more brutal measures and to treat <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> as `` bona fide enemy soldiers.'' The army so far has rejected the call, refusing to do the politicians' `` dirty work,'' <PERSON> Schiff </PERSON> said. Troops in <LOCATION> Rafah </LOCATION> fatally wounded Valid <PERSON> Omar </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Abed </PERSON>, 23, in the abdomen and he died at <LOCATION> Nasser </LOCATION> hospital in <LOCATION> Khan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yunis </LOCATION>, hospital officials reported. The army confirmed the death, saying <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Abed </PERSON> was shot during a demonstration in which Palestinians hurled stones and metal bars at soldiers. <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said the death touched off riots at the crowded <LOCATION> Idna </LOCATION> neighborhood and army reinforcements poured in. Palestinian reports and <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Amir </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuad </PERSON> <PERSON> Nasser </PERSON>, 25, died of a gunshot wound to the head and 17-year-old <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Abed </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabbo </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Oun </PERSON> was fatally shot in the head and abdomen, and that both were immediately buried in <LOCATION> Rafah </LOCATION>.

 The government lost a dry run of a $ 300 million lawsuit brought by neighbors of a federal uranium processing plant and now will have to decide whether to settle the case, an <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said Friday. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Spiegel </PERSON> used a non-binding, hurry-up procedure called a summary trial to encourage a settlement. The eight-member jury decided Thursday to recommend a $ 136 million award to residents who claim they were hurt by contamination from the Feed Materials Production Center in <LOCATION> Fernald </LOCATION>, 18 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION>. The jury ruled that <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lead </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> operated the plant in a way that caused neighbors to suffer emotional distress and lowered property values. National Lead, which operated the plant from 1951 through 1985, was sued with parent company <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lead </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> argued that the companies could not be liable because they carried out the government's directions. <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> lawyer <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Gill </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said the government would pay any settlement of the case because of an indemnification clause in its contract with the operator. If there is no settlement, the case goes to actual trial Aug. 15 before <PERSON> Spiegel </PERSON>. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Will </PERSON> <PERSON> Callicott </PERSON> said officials would have to confer with <PERSON> Gill </PERSON> next week before responding to a statement by <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Chesley </PERSON>, lawyer for the 14,000 plaintiffs, that he would consider a settlement offer. `` We're going to have to assess what the most appropriate course of action for us is,'' <PERSON> Callicott </PERSON> said. The department admitted in documents filed with the court that the government sometimes told the operators to emphasize production and not worry about environmental protection or regulations. The plant is one of several government nuclear weapons facilities around the country whose safety has been challenged, prompting expensive cleanups and interruptions in production. In <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> agreed with authorities Friday to tighten federal monitoring of the Rocky Flats plant, where investigators are looking for evidence of illegal waste dumping. Residents around <PERSON> Fernald </PERSON> said in their lawsuit that radioactive contamination from the plant has polluted soil, air and water in their environment, causing them mental stress and making their homes undesirable. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Carpenter </PERSON>, a staff lawyer with the Washington-based Government Accountability Project, a non-profit watchdog group, said he thought the jury's verdict did not go far enough. <PERSON> Carpenter </PERSON> said he investigated the plant for several years on behalf of disgruntled workers and found negligence and inattention to worker health and safety. `` They went too far at <LOCATION> Fernald </LOCATION>, definitely, and the lapse was inexcusable,'' <PERSON> Carpenter </PERSON> said. The Energy Department estimates that 383,000 pounds of radioactive uranium oxide dust has been released from faulty exhaust-air filters since the plant opened. Government lawyers said the material has not endangered residents or harmed property. <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Materials </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> has operated the plant since January 1986.

 The centrist <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> denounced as repressive and unconstitutional on Friday a proposed law by the new rightist administration to crack down on those who disagree with it. The governing <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nationalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>, known as <PERSON> Arena </PERSON>, has called the legislation a `` law in defense of the democratic process.'' It proposes fines and prison sentences for those who oppose the government or its policies, including journalists and those who take part in protest marches. <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> leaders gave reporters a copy of the proposed law, which executive committee member <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Perdomo </PERSON> called `` the preamble to total repression in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON> <PERSON> Mena </PERSON>, party secretary-general and one-time presidential nominee, told a news conference the measure was unconstitutional and would `` violate the most elemental guarantees and individual rights.'' <PERSON> Arena </PERSON> was scheduled to submit the bill for congressional approval on Thursday but did not. Arena members did not explain at that time why the legislation was not submitted and refused to discuss details with reporters. <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON>'s new president is <PERSON> Arena </PERSON> member <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cristiani </PERSON>, who assumed power June 1 from <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrat </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON> <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> after winning big in March elections. <PERSON> Gloria </PERSON> <PERSON> Salguero </PERSON> <PERSON> Gross </PERSON>, a high-ranking <PERSON> Arena </PERSON> member and assembly deputy, told reporters Thursday the assassination of <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> member <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> <PERSON> Porth </PERSON> on June 9 `` is a call to reflect and we must give an answer within the constitution, within the arms of democracy.'' <PERSON> Arena </PERSON> holds a congressional majority. Arena officials and the military blamed the killing on the <ORGANIZATION> Farabundo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla group, or <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION>. The Marxist-led <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday issued a communique denying responsibility. The guerrillas said the 73-year-old minister of the presidency probably was shot on June 9 as a result of factional fighting within the government. The <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION> has fought the U.S.-backed government for nine years. <PERSON> Perdomo </PERSON> said Friday, `` We are worried that a repressive law such as this could in one given moment bite down on the social and political forces of this country, taking away the space we have to oppose and fight for the interests of the great majority.'' The bill would establish fines for the <ORGANIZATION> FMLN </ORGANIZATION> and what the government considers to be rebel-related groups that engage in armed actions, sabotage, strikes or public demonstrations that `` clog traffic on principal roadways, avenues or streets of the a city, impeding the passage of people or vehicles.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> pointed to one article they said denies freedom of the press. It would makes it illegal for reporters to send outside the country news or information `` destined to upset the constitutional or legal order, the tranquility or security of the country, the economic or monetary regimen.'' The government will move against publishers and broadcasters `` who use in their journalistic pages or on radio and television transmissions such news or information,'' the legislation says. The document says the legislation would augment a law already on the books banning `` the existence of armed groups of a political, labor union or religious character.''

 An Organization of American States mission to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> failed in its second attempt to persuade the government and opposition to agree to hold negotiations on the country's political crisis, officials said Thursday. <PERSON> Diego </PERSON> <PERSON> Cordovez </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION>'s foreign minister and veteran <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> negotiator in the <LOCATION> Afghan </LOCATION> conflict, said `` it is necessary and urgent'' that <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s conflicting sectors open a dialogue.

 The administration is hailing the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> version of savings and loan bailout legislation as a major victory for taxpayers after the resounding defeat of an attempt to weaken President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s key reform proposal. Shortly before 11 p.m. Thursday, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> capped a 13-hour session by voting 320-97 to solve the worst financial crisis since the Depression with the most expensive government bailout in history. It will cost, according to the congressional <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, $ 285 billion over 30 years _ $ 157 billion of that from taxpayers. The legislation also includes a series of what <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has labeled `` never again'' provisions.

 Human rights groups claim <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> military courts that try Palestinians for such things as throwing stones at soldiers are biased because both judges and witnesses are army comrades. The groups also maintain that <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers brought before the same courts on charges of abusing Palestinians get proportionately lighter sentences than the Arabs. The military rejects the claims. `` Palestinians throw stones often to kill. Soldiers act in response to the violence,'' said Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Amnon </PERSON> <PERSON> Straschnow </PERSON>, head of the military court system. He maintained the trials are fair. He said several hundred Palestinians have been acquitted in stone-throwing cases, even when soldiers identified the accused. `` We are conducting justice under fire,'' <PERSON> Straschnow </PERSON> said in an interview. `` This may not be a classic war, but it is a kind of war. But we try to balance this security problem which is unprecedented, on the one hand, with the need to honor individudal rights.'' One recent day in the military court in <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION>, a 15-year-old Palestinian, <PERSON> Munzer </PERSON> <PERSON> Zaatari </PERSON>, was convicted of throwing stones at soldiers in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> village of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ram </LOCATION> on May 9, although he insisted he was in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> at the time. The military judge, Maj. <PERSON> Shlomo </PERSON> <PERSON> Isaacson </PERSON>, decided on the guilty verdict even though a key witness, a soldier, contradicted his own previously written statement about the location of the arrest. <PERSON> Isaacson </PERSON> sentenced <PERSON> Zaatari </PERSON> to 10 months in jail, although no one was hurt in the stoning incident. `` These actions have turned into a plague on our country which must be uprooted,'' the judge said. `` I did n't do anything,'' the jean-clad <PERSON> Zaatari </PERSON> shouted as a soldier led him out of the courtroom. In an adjacent courtroom the same day, Maj. <PERSON> Jonathan </PERSON> <PERSON> Livni </PERSON> acquitted <PERSON> Ibrahim </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaber </PERSON>, 18, of charges of throwing stones at soldiers Nov. 16. He had been caught with a slingshot and a knife, but <PERSON> Livni </PERSON> based his decision on the testimony of a soldier who said he had recognized the stonethrowers from a distance of 150 yards. The trials were among dozens that are held daily to process most of the 35,000 Arabs who, by official count, have been arrested since the uprising began 18 months ago. Before the start of the rebellion, which has claimed the lives of more than 500 Palestinians and 22 Israelis, the military courts dealt mainly with cases involving armed attacks or terrorism. Today they are inundated with cases involving stonings, tire burnings, flag raisings, demonstrations. More than 13,000 Palestinians have been tried since December 1987, when the uprising began, compared to about 1,000 the previous year, according to army statistics. The average sentence has been a year in jail and a fine the equivalent of $ 500. Many of those arrested are released before being brought to trial and about 6 percent have been acquitted. Nearly 5,000 others are awaiting trial. Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> said 8,500 Palestinians are behind bars for uprising-related offenses excluding 4,000 security prisoners jailed earlier. He said the army intends to increase its prison capacity to accommodate 1,500 more. <PERSON> Straschnow </PERSON> said the heavy caseload has forced him to double the number of judges to six full time and 60 reservists on call. In April he also implemented a <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> recommendation to set up a new army appeals court to give Palestinians a second chance. `` It is an excellent example of the rule of law even in a difficult period like this,'' <PERSON> Straschnow </PERSON> said. However, as in the case of <PERSON> Zaatari </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> attorneys are reluctant to appeal, fearing they will set a precedent that will institutionalize harsh sentences for acts such as throwing stones. A human rights report by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> published in January said `` acquittals are rare'' for Palestinians in Israeli military courts. The civil rights group <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Haq </PERSON>, an Arab-run affiliate of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jurists </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>, said, `` Evidence of an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldier in military court is almost always believed in preference to the detainees.'' Another focus of criticism has been the wide use of so-called administrative detention in which activists are jailed for up to six months without trial. About 5,000 Arabs have been held without trial during the course of the uprising; 1,508 currently are held in such detention, according to the army. <PERSON> Straschnow </PERSON> said administrative detention was used only in serious cases where evidence could not be submitted in open court to protect the source, presumeably an informer or secret agent. `` We maintain the rules of standard and reasonable trial and due process,'' <PERSON> Straschnow </PERSON> said. He noted that trials are public and suspects are represented by lawyers. `` It's a hopeless case, this military system,'' said <PERSON> Osama </PERSON> <PERSON> Saadi </PERSON>, <PERSON> Zaatari </PERSON>'s Palestinian lawyer. `` It's arbitrary. The judges and prosecutors are on the same side, so one side's story is usually accepted more than the other,'' Of 67 Israeli soldiers who have gone on military trial, 36 were found guilty of misconduct, ranging from assault and battery to causing death by unnecessary use of beatings or shootings. The heaviest sentence has been 21 months for causing death. An additional 400 soldiers have been disciplined by their commanders with such punishments as loss of rank or position.

 Finding a new home is n't easy if you're 30 feet tall and weigh 50 tons But if your name is <PERSON> Ramses </PERSON> the Great, welcome mats come out all over. The question for Egyptian antiquities officials was which mat to choose and they now have decided the proper thing would be to bring <PERSON> Ramses </PERSON> back home from <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> to this quiet village on the edge of the desert, known in Ramses' time as <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>. The rose granite colossus of the warrior <PERSON> Pharaoh </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramses </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, who reigned in 1292-1225 B.C., was taken from <ORGANIZATION> Mit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rahina </ORGANIZATION> in 1954 to a platform in front of <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION>'s bustling central railway depot on orders of <PERSON> Gamal </PERSON> <PERSON> Abdel </PERSON> <PERSON> Nasser </PERSON>, who had taken power in a coup two years before. That decision proved a headache for the officials, however. They worried that exhaust fumes from heavy motor vehicle traffic would cause the statue to crumble and that the vibration from railroad and subway trains beneath it would cause it to crack. In the late 1980s talk turned to saving it. One suggestion was to move <PERSON> Ramses </PERSON> to the <ORGANIZATION> Giza </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pyramids </ORGANIZATION> and another was to put him on an artificial island in the Nile. In early June, however, a different course was decided. `` We decided to take him home, back where we got him,'' said <PERSON> Sayed </PERSON> <PERSON> Tawfik </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Egyptian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Antiquities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. When <PERSON> Ramses </PERSON> left <ORGANIZATION> Mit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rahina </ORGANIZATION> for the square renamed for him, <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> was a city of tree-lined boulevards. Today it's a megacity of 12 million people and growing. `` Poor Ramses,'' Egyptologist <PERSON> Gamal </PERSON> <PERSON> Mokhtar </PERSON>, a former chairman of the antiquities organization, said in <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION>. `` He was brought here at the request of ... President <PERSON> Nasser </PERSON>, who had overthrown the monarchy and wanted a symbol of ancient Egyptian power. Nobody questioned it. You did n't at that time. Nobody thought whether being in the city center was good for the statue. It is n't.'' <PERSON> Nasser </PERSON> died in 1970. The statue has to be moved not only for its safety but also the Pharaoh's dignity, <PERSON> Mokhtar </PERSON> said. `` Such statues never belonged in a public square,'' he said. `` They belonged in temples, facing the people, as a warning and reminder of the Pharaoh's might. `` When you come into <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> from the north, you see <PERSON> Ramses </PERSON>' backside That was never meant to be on public view. For one of <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s greatest Pharaohs, this is n't proper.'' <PERSON> Mit </PERSON> <PERSON> Rahina </PERSON> is a fitting place for <PERSON> Ramses </PERSON>. It is rimmed with date palms and swaying halfa grass, which, when it was called <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, brought fear and dread to adversaries throughout the ancient world. <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION> was <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s first true capital and later its military headquarters. Ramses II brought great power and wealth to <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>. He built more buildings and more colossal statues than any other Pharaoh. He had other capitals, but <PERSON> Ramses </PERSON> had special affection for <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, 17 miles south of <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION> is thought to have begun life as no more than a tiny fortress beside the Nile, protected by a white wall. In its heyday it stretched for miles and incorporated military barracks, temples, palaces, shipyards, weapons factories and craftshops. Its cemeteries extended for 50 miles and included the <LOCATION> Giza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plateau </LOCATION>, home of the pyramids. Historians record that its Temple of <LOCATION> Ptah </LOCATION>, the creator god and <PERSON> Memphis </PERSON>' patron, was a third of a mile long and a quarter-mile wide and fronted by monumental statues of <PERSON> Ramses </PERSON>. How many colossi of Ramses graced <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION> is not known, but records say at least 15 were at the Ptah temple alone. A fallen statue that would have stood about 45 feet, with fingernails the size of hands, lies toppled on its back. A third colossus is the centerpiece of the Ramses exhibit now in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, at the end of a tour of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Pieces of other statues lie among ancient <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>' ruins, red granite torsos and heads mingled haphazardly with weeds. Some are covered with dirt for protection from village children, who use the ruins for playgrounds. For part of the year the sacred texts, column bases and statues are trapped in marshes, salty water rising as high as 6 -LCB- feet, soaking and decaying all in its path. <PERSON> Tawfik </PERSON> said he believes the return of <PERSON> Ramses </PERSON> will mark a new beginning for the ancient city. `` When visitors come to <LOCATION> Mit </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rahina </LOCATION>, they stay only 30 minutes or so, just enough to see the fallen <PERSON> Ramses </PERSON> and the monuments on display,'' he said. `` We want to provide enough to keep them here all day.'' He said <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION> suffered because it was too important for too long. Lived in for 1,700 years by <PERSON> Ramses </PERSON>' time, the city was built largely of perishable mud-brick. Generations built on the fallen mud-brick houses of their forbears so that `` what we have now are ruins, not a complete city,'' <PERSON> Tawfik </PERSON> said. Except for the remnants of the once-magnificent temples, little of old <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION> remains in <LOCATION> Mit </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rahina </LOCATION>. `` The ancient Egyptian ... was mainly interested in the netherworld, the afterlife. This is where he put his major efforts,'' <PERSON> Tawfik </PERSON> said. `` This is why we have left so many examples of monuments for eternity but not so many for life.''

 Last summer, viewers of `` Evening at Pops'' tapped their feet to everything from <PERSON> Tchaikovsky </PERSON> to <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sondheim </PERSON>, <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Garfunkel </PERSON> to <LOCATION> Irving </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, not to mention conductor <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>' scores for `` Star Trek,'' `` E.T., The Exterrestrial'' and `` Raiders of the Lost Ark.'' After 20 years on <ORGANIZATION> PBS </ORGANIZATION>, the eclectic summertime perennial is one of the longest-running and most-watched public television programs. `` I do n't think its name is accidental,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> McGhee </PERSON>, program manager for national productions at <ORGANIZATION> WGBH-TV </ORGANIZATION>, which produces the series. `` ` Pops' is short for popular, right? It draws on a sort of mainstream popular musical vernacular and it does so in a musically intelligent way with people of great luster and accomplishment.'' Beginning Friday _ check your local <ORGANIZATION> PBS </ORGANIZATION> station schedule _ <ORGANIZATION> PBS </ORGANIZATION> will air a special 20th-anniversary `` Evening at Pops,'' taped at <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Symphony </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hall </ORGANIZATION>, the home of the Pops. The concert kicking off the 12-week season features humorist <PERSON> Art </PERSON> <PERSON> Buchwald </PERSON>, opera stars <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Merrill </PERSON> and <PERSON> Roberta </PERSON> <PERSON> Peters </PERSON>, comic-pianist <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Borge </PERSON> and piano duo <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> and <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Paratore </PERSON>. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> took over as Pops conductor in 1980 after the death of <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Fiedler </PERSON>. `` I do n't think it's complacent to point out that the popularity of the Pops does not seem to have diminished at all ... -LRB- but -RRB- we have to keep up the search for a new repertoire, finding new things, discarding things that no longer work,'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said in a recent interview. `` The Pops is famous for delivering a certain glowing, good feeling that it must produce each and every time out. The amazing thing is that it does.'' <PERSON> McGhee </PERSON> suggested that the show is so popular because it is `` a refuge from the violence and banality of the rest of television.'' `` Evening at Pops,'' runs from June through August. Half the 60-minute concerts are new, the rest are repeats. The Pops was born 104 years ago when the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Symphony </ORGANIZATION> performed its first `` Music Hall Promenade Concert.'' The Pops' first program promised: `` The Programme for these Concerts will be made up largely of light music of the best class.'' To draw summer crowds, the concerts offered electric lighting, instead of the more stifling gas lights which drew oxygen from the air, and cafe tables set up in a hall where alcoholic beverages could be consumed, a move considered risky by staid Bostonians. The <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION> reviewed the inaugural concert on its front page and declared, `` More than a ` sea-change' has come over Music Hall. The statue of <PERSON> Beethoven </PERSON>, which has witnessed many a strange sight, looked out last evening on a summer garden scene as Teutonic as though <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> were in -LRB- the -RRB- Fatherland.'' Newspapers came to refer to the summer shows as `` popular promenade concerts'' and from this came the truncated moniker `` pops.'' In 1969, the orchestra took to the airwaves and has been there ever since. Although under the baton of <ORGANIZATION> Williams </ORGANIZATION> since 1980, for many people `` Pops'' is synonymous with <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Fiedler </PERSON>. For 50 years, until his death in 1979 at age 84, the mustachioed maestro conducted embroidered classics as well as lush renderings of modern fare from Broadway, <LOCATION> Tin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alley </LOCATION> and even <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Elvis </PERSON> <PERSON> Presley </PERSON> and the Beatles are among the composers whose works <PERSON> Fiedler </PERSON> translated into Pops style. With his exuberant, almost baroque orchestration of well-known songs and symphonies, <PERSON> Fiedler </PERSON> has been credited with placing the Pops among the most recorded orchestras in the world.

 Two years ago, the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> tested a trout from the river and it had a dioxin level of 90 parts per trillion, more than three times higher than the consumption cutoff level recommended by the government. Sludge taken from the river has tested as high as 260 parts per trillion. `` If, after three years the company has met all of our requirements, we will issue them a discharge release permit,'' <PERSON> Marlar </PERSON> said. `` Meanwhile, as long as they continue to operate without a permit they are leaving themselves liable to possible legal actions.'' <PERSON> Blackwell </PERSON> estimated the compromise proposal would mean a 50 percent reduction of the mill's workforce over the next few years. He said it will cost Champion about $ 300 million to install the necessary technology. `` But,'' he added, `` it will allow us to remain in operation.

 When GIs came home after World War II, the nation looked to the great forests of the <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION> for lumber to build their houses. <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> mills responded, and still supply more than a third of the lumber and plywood used in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` There was always that one more shining hill covered with trees to the west,'' said <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> budget officer <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>. `` Now we find there's a <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> and we fell into it.'' From the western slope of the Cascade Range to the shore of the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>, this is the home of the Douglas fir, the towering king of the ancient forests whose structural strength tops all other lumber. It is also home to the Northern spotted owl, a 14-inch bird that could face extinction because, with rare exceptions, it wo n't nest or hunt anywhere but the dwindling virgin forests that are most prized for timber. While logs are tied up in the legal battle over how much of the national forests can be cut without killing off the spotted owl, record amounts of raw timber grown on private and state land are being shipped for premium prices to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> without ever seeing the inside of an American mill. `` If a log is of export quality, and is available to be exported, it will be exported,'' said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Mayr </PERSON>, owner of the <ORGANIZATION> Mayr </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> mill in <LOCATION> Hoquiam </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mayr </PERSON> has been reduced to counting his supply in months instead of years while watching a stream of logs being loaded onto ships in <LOCATION> Grays </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION> `` We want to put out logs to the highest value market In recent years the highest value has been offshore,'' said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, operations manager for <ORGANIZATION> Weyerhaeuser </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Coos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, where the region's leading exporter of raw logs has started a new mill to produce metric-dimension lumber for the Japanese home-building market Companies can generally get 25 percent more for export logs than they can in the domestic market, said <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> economist <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Flora </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>. Boom-and-bust cycles were known to the timber industry before the spotted owl entered the spotlight, but for the first time the pinch is from a shortage of logs rather than rising mortgage rates and dips in the housing market. Eighteen years ago, <PERSON> Brad </PERSON> <PERSON> Wentworth </PERSON> stopped off in the coastal town of <LOCATION> Gold </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> to see some friends on his way to college to study forest management. Now he's 37, a husband and father, and one of the 300 workers at Gold Beach Plywood who will be out of a job this summer when the mill shuts down. `` I got sucked into the mill because it was such good wages,'' <PERSON> Wentworth </PERSON> said. `` I kick myself in the butt now.'' Thirteen other wood products mills in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> have closed this year, putting nearly 2,000 people out of work as the industry enters a new era of high-priced timber in short supply. `` The mill is old and inefficient,'' said <LOCATION> Gold </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> mill manager <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Saunders </PERSON>. `` It would take about $ 3 million to bring it up. Why should we put in that kind of investment without knowing there is a stable supply of timber?'' The shortage of timber does n't come as a surprise, but its magnitude does. In 1976, <ORGANIZATION> Oregon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> forestry professor <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Beuter </PERSON> reported that little mature timber was left on private land and that the industry would have to depend on national forests, home to most of the old-growth timber, to make it to the next century, when second-growth trees planted before World War II would be ready for harvest. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>, director of resource services for <ORGANIZATION> Seattle </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Simpson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Timber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, had expected harvests in national forests to decline about 20 percent in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> this year as the <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> revised its long-range management plans He now fears it could drop 50 percent because old-growth forests have been ruled off-limits because of the spotted owl. `` Historically, a lot of the impetus for the management of federal lands in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> was to settle the West and develop it,'' said <PERSON> Beuter </PERSON>, now a consultant in <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>. `` We are sort of at the end of that era now. We are at the point of recognizing that cutting more timber is n't going to create new cities and new economic opportunity in the West. In fact, we are coming around to where saving the forests may create new economic opportunity.'' <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitelaw </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oregon </ORGANIZATION> economics professor, has been a leading proponent of the idea that the Northwest has more to gain from preserving its blue skies, green forests and clear water than from exploiting its resources. `` Most Oregonians receive two paychecks,'' he said. `` One is in dollars. The other comes from the environment. By accounting for all other amenities, I estimate that the environmental paycheck is worth $ 1.3 billion. The paycheck from the timber industry is $ 1.5 billion.'' In 1988, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> national forests supplied 5.4 billion board feet of timber, a third of the region's total harvest from all lands. Where the <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> management plans used in the 1980s allowed the annual harvest of 5.5 billion board feet, the limit in the 1990s will be closer to 4.7 billion. Unlike owners of private forests, the <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> by law may cut no more timber than it can grow back. It also has to provide for the needs of fish, wildlife, campers, hikers and water quality. Where it once had to answer only to the timber industry, the service now has a crowd of watchdogs panting over its shoulder. The governors of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> want to be sure there is enough timber to sustain the rural economy. Environmental groups demand preservation of old-growth forests. Academics have started offering new management techniques that follow the lead of nature. And there is new unrest inside the <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> DeBonis </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Willamette </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> timber sale planner, has organized the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employees </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ethics </ORGANIZATION>, with a mailing list of about 200. <PERSON> DeBonis </PERSON> wrote in February to <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> claiming the agency is in bed with the industry. `` The question we need to ask concerned citizens is, ` Why should the national forests be sacrificed to an overzealous and greedy industry that liquidated their own lands to make a fast cut?''' he said. <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>'s staff is preparing a detailed response to <PERSON> DeBonis </PERSON>' letter, said spokeswoman <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> <PERSON> Narlock </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> `` Maybe we need some of these things talked about It was a gutsy move on his part.'' <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> has acknowledged that the <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> has taken a beating in the courts under the National Environmental Policy Act, evidence <PERSON> DeBonis </PERSON> cites for his argument that too many trees are being cut. While loggers tie yellow ribbons to their trucks and demand more timber, the grim truth is jobs are disappearing, spotted owl or no spotted owl. `` The biggest source of change in employment has been the modernization and automation of the forest products industry,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Wilderness </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> economist <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Olson </PERSON>, who produced a study concluding the decline in timber jobs in the <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION> has little to do with cutting old growth in national forests. <LOCATION> Flora </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> economist, said in the 1970s he figured each 1 million board feet of timber translated into eight timber jobs. That's now down to 1.5 jobs in the high-tech mills and four to five jobs overall. Timber is virtually extinct as a factor in the economies of <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, but still vital in small cities and towns that grew up with it. <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>'s 68,700 wood-products jobs _ almost all of them outside the <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION> area _ account for 5.2 percent of the state's employment <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s 41,800 timber jobs account for 2.1 percent of its employment. In 1986, the most recent figures available, timber accounted for just 6 percent of <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>'s gross state product at $ 2.5 billion and 2.2 percent of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s, at $ 1.6 billion. But <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> economist <PERSON> Con </PERSON> <PERSON> Schallau </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Corvallis </LOCATION> argues timber has a greater impact than that, because it accounts for 38 percent of <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>'s basic economy _ bringing in outside dollars _ and 18 percent of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s. While economists may differ over timber's importance, they agree the places that will be hurt worst are towns like <LOCATION> Gold </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, population 1,500, with a payroll of $ 6 million from Gold Beach Plywood. `` If you live in a big city you've got a lot of choices,'' <PERSON> Wentworth </PERSON> said, `` but if you live here you've got to work in the brush or the mill.''

 One tip that <ORGANIZATION> Weyerhaeuser </ORGANIZATION> is taking bold steps with its newest sawmill is the bed of pansies in the log yard. <ORGANIZATION> Weyerhaeuser </ORGANIZATION>, a leading exporter of logs to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, has gone a step further to produce precision-sawn, metric-dimension lumber for Japanese home builders, for whom the appearance of wood for traditional post-and-beam construction counts more than the structural strength valued in the American market. `` We want to put out logs to the highest value market. In recent years the highest value has been offshore,'' said operations manager <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>. So the company scrapped an aging mill in North Bend on the southern coast and converted a cedar plant here into its mill of the'90s, called CBX. `` We're pulling out all the stops,'' said superintendent <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickey </PERSON> as he showed off the paved log yard, laser-guided saws, flowers and a new management style that emphasizes teamwork. `` We're spending $ 1 million on the upgrade. But high-tech also means fewer jobs. When <ORGANIZATION> Weyerhaeuser </ORGANIZATION> announced the CBX project in January, <PERSON> North </PERSON> <PERSON> Bend </PERSON> employed about 200 and produced about 65 million board feet a year, about 3 jobs per million board feet. The CBX crew of 69 can produce 45 million board feet a year, or 1.5 jobs per million feet. The mills that survive the current shakeup in the industry must be extremely efficient, and <PERSON> Dickey </PERSON> expects his hand-picked crew to lead the way. `` We're aiming to have this site be the model for the industry.'' To emphasize that point, <ORGANIZATION> Weyerhaeuser </ORGANIZATION> has installed catwalks for visitors. `` All the major Japanese trading companies have been here once or twice,'' said <PERSON> Dickey </PERSON>, who is learning Japanese. While <ORGANIZATION> Weyerhaeuser </ORGANIZATION> took the obvious steps of upgrading the physical plant at CBX, it also is going where no sawmill has gone before in its contract with the International Woodworkers of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. `` Basically, it lets people work as teams rather than in individual job situations,'' said <PERSON> Milo </PERSON> <PERSON> Summerville </PERSON>, field representative for IWA Local 3-261. `` Sometimes you have to give something like this a trial period to see if it will work.'' Lumber grader <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Esch </PERSON> is enthusiastic about being able to rotate through three positions rather than sticking to one job. `` It's kind of like being an immigrant in a new country,'' he said. <PERSON> Cheryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Howell </PERSON>, an 11-year veteran of the company, scored well on a hand-eye coordination test, and was cross-trained to run bark-stripping machinery and giant loaders in the yard. `` Before it's done, I expect to know how to run everything in here,'' she said. The first shift starts at 6:30 a.m., with workers and managers joining in 10 minutes of exercises, followed by as much as 45 minutes of talk as the crew helps make management decisions. To emphasize teamwork, <ORGANIZATION> Weyerhaeuser </ORGANIZATION> scrapped an old cleanup contract and made everyone, including <PERSON> Dickey </PERSON>, responsible for keeping the mill clean. <PERSON> Dickey </PERSON> is happy to get away from the old-style management approach he calls `` big brain-little brain.'' `` Generally you get dissatisfied employees because they are starved for information,'' he said. `` We're giving them a big piece of the operation.''

 In the rugged Illahe country where gold miners still pan creeks running into the <LOCATION> Rogue </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Siskiyou </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> is trying techniques from a movement known as the New Forestry. `` I see it as a major philosophical change rather than an incremental change,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> scientist <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON>, a leading spokesman for the movement. `` In terms of forestry practice, it is revolutionary.'' The New Forestry is gaining credibility in the midst of debate over how much national forest can be logged while preserving the old growth ecosystem. Pressure to log these forests has increased as private lands have been overcut. `` We need to make this crisis the basis for not just resolving the issue of how much old growth to leave, but perhaps more important, how do we manage our commodity lands over the long term,'' <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> said. `` People are looking for ways to harvest the forest and provide jobs, yet keep values that are important to the public,'' said Gold Beach District Ranger <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>. `` The public is interested in old-growth forest, interested in the species that inhabit the old growth forest. `` We think there is an opportunity for these New Forestry techniques to provide that middle ground.'' While most national forests in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> still are developing 10-year management plans, the <ORGANIZATION> Siskiyou </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> has fit the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forestry </ORGANIZATION> into its plan with a goal of balancing production against a healthy forest. The key to New Forestry is to save more of the forest's parts so what is left after logging has the best chance of surviving radical climate changes a growing number of scientists predict will come within the next 50 years. On the <LOCATION> Siskiyou </LOCATION>, the New Forestry is the basis for plans to start logging in the next couple years the 7,100 acres known as the Illahe Project, about 40 miles west of Grants Pass in southwestern <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>. `` As we move out from that large block of old-growth forest into areas previously harvested, we feather out the impacts,'' said <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>. `` We'll leave a certain amount of old-growth trees per acre. That number increases as you get closer to the undisturbed block of old growth forest.'' That differs radically from traditional practice of clearcuts of 20 to 40 acres scattered throughout the forest in hopes of diluting the impact. As scientists have learned more about how pieces of the forest interact they have found that scattered clearcuts fragmented the ecosystem, breaking it into pieces too small to function. They also have found it valuable to leave corridors linking the pieces of forest. Instead of clearcutting, New Foresters will leave dead trees and some live trees standing to give animals places to feed and live. Some logs will be left to rot and restore organic material to the soil. Planners say the New Forestry will mean a 5 percent cut in timber production over the 130-year harvest cycle. No decision has been made on how to approach slash burning, in which debris left by clearcutting is burned to return minerals to the soil, reduce fire danger, and make it easier to plant seedlings, <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said. When it comes to replanting logged-over land, the New Forestry suggests restoring the mix of species that were cut, to maintain a diverse genetic base more able to withstand future climatic change, rather than filling the land with one commercially valuable species such as Douglas fir. <ORGANIZATION> Oregon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> forestry professor <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Perry </PERSON>, also part of the New Forestry movement, said, `` The point is that whatever you do to take trees off it has got to be consistent with the adaptations of the forest that have evolved over millenia to cope with disurbance.''

 <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hornbeck </PERSON> aimed his truck up the winding mountain road and eyed the aged forest looming above. `` There is your pristine old-growth forest,'' said the logger, pointing to silver shafts of dead and dying trees within the green shag of hemlock, fir and lighter-colored cedar. `` To me, it's not beauty. It's a little bit pathetic. It's a forest that's overripe. `` It would have been logged by now, but it was pulled from the market because of the spotted owl, and I do n't think it will ever be logged now. If they take it away, it's a way of life that is gone, not just jobs.'' Whether, when, and where cutting may resume in many Northwestern national forests wo n't be known until <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Dwyer </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> decides whether to alter a March injunction temporarily halting the sale of 1 billion board feet of timber in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dwyer </PERSON>'s ruling came in a lawsuit challenging a <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> plan to set aside 374,000 acres as habitat for the Northern spotted owl. Environmentalists charged that the plan fails to set aside enough old-growth forest to ensure the owls' survival; <PERSON> Dwyer </PERSON>'s injunction expands the affected acreage Meanwhile, the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Fish and Wildlife _ which refused in 1987 to list the spotted owl as a threatened species _ reversed itself in March and decided the bird's dwindling habitat warrants giving it that status, a year-long process. Oregon Gov. <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldschmidt </PERSON> and state congressional leaders have called a summit meeting Saturday in <LOCATION> Salem </LOCATION> to try to resolve conflicts over the owl. The governor, the state's entire congressional delegation and representatives of government agencies and timber and environmental groups will attend. The prospect that the owl will be listed as a threatened species has added more doubt to the future of timber supplies. But there is much more at stake than board feet of lumber and a subspecies of spotted owls, said forest ecologist <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wilderness </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> office, who insists, `` I'm no tree hugger.'' `` We need to consider long-term impacts on biological diversity,'' said <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON>, noting that relatively little is known about virgin forests and interactions between plants and animals in them. `` I can see serious impacts if we give up that biological diversity found in an ancient forest, and by then it will be too late. ... It's not going to be just the spotted owl disappearing.'' The unique attachment of the owl to old growth is what put the bird in the middle of controversy. Biologists say that while the owl can use other forest land, it requires a certain amount of old growth for nesting and mating. If that old growth is too fragmented, the owl could spend so much time seeking food and shelter that it would n't have time or energy to mate. The <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> does n't know how much old growth is left, but <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wilderness </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> has estimated that less than 15 percent of the original old-growth forest remains in the owl's range from northern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> to southern <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>. What is left is so badly fragmented that much of it is worthless as habitat for the owl and other wildlife. `` People want to say, ` Let's sit down at a table and reasonably talk about this dividing of a loaf,' when in reality the loaf is all gone. What we are doing is squabbling over the crumbs,'' said <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Mount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> biologist now working for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION>. But <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, executive director of FFACTS, a group in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Skagit </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> organized this spring to defend the timber industry, said it's the livelihood of workers and their families that's at stake. National parks, wilderness areas, wild and scenic rivers and other set-asides have removed 53 percent of the federal forest lands in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> from the timber base, he said. `` We simply ca n't write off our industry.'' For example, six timber sales in the <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Baker </LOCATION> <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> covering half of the 2,200 acres set aside for one pair of spotted owls would have produced 47 million board feet of timber to keep local mills running for the next year. `` To us, that's our life,'' said <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>. `` To them, it's for one owl.'' <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerr </PERSON>, conservation director of the <ORGANIZATION> Oregon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, said timber jobs are going, owl or no owl. He cited a study by The <ORGANIZATION> Wilderness </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> estimating that the 71,500 timber jobs in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> in 1985 will shrink to half that by 2030 mainly because of increased mill productivity. Stopping the harvest of old growth altogether would eliminate only 6 percent of the timber and 2,300 extra jobs in that period, the study said. <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Sisco </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Audubon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, another <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> veteran, said the agency has bungled the works since 1978, when it picked the owl as the indicator species for the well-being of the old-growth ecosystem under provisions of the National Forest Management Act. About two-thirds of the sites the <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> identified in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> as owl habitats would affect lumbering, but `` their own data showed that 65 or 70 percent of the areas they said were spotted owl sites in wilderness -LRB- where logging is prohibited -RRB- did n't have any birds in them,'' <PERSON> Sisco </PERSON> said. On the west side of the Olympics, <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>, owner of the <ORGANIZATION> Mason </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lumber </ORGANIZATION> mill in Beaver, reiterated the doubts held by many in the timber industry that the spotted owl is threatened. Even if the owl's days are numbered, he said, it is not responsible to shut timber supplies down overnight. <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> complained that the fight over the owl vividly illustrates the growing urban-rural separation in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, where the Seattle-area economy has been fueled by a growing aerospace industry and computer-age businesses while the traditional forest industry has been pushed aside. `` You know,'' he said, `` There are people who have to get their hands dirty every day earning a living, and there are city people who think the forests should be their private playgrounds.''

 The 15-foot cross made of old-growth timber stands across from <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Leppell </PERSON>'s saw shop, where it was hewn. A half-dozen plastic owls are nailed to the crossbeam with a sign that says: `` Here lie the hopes and dreams of our children.'' The residents of this Olympic Peninsula logging town say they are being crucified by environmentalists and the government, which have closed, at least temporarily, thousands of acres of timber to preserve old-growth forest and one of its elusive denizens, the Northern spotted owl. `` Every way you turn, the government, the preservationists, big business, they all want your job,'' said <PERSON> Garth </PERSON> <PERSON> Leavitt </PERSON>, a log hauler. `` What do they want us to do? Move to the cities where there's no work and no place to live?'' Forks _ an isolated town of 3,000 on the western edge of the Olympic National Park, 150 miles from <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> _ sits in a broad valley surrounded by bare green hills that still bear scars of what modern loggers contemptuously call `` cut-and-run boys'' who took the timber but did n't bother to replant. Logging trucks roar down a main street of gas stations and small stores. Neighborhoods are dotted with swingsets, lush gardens and yards decorated with rusting saws and other logging tools. The air carries the peaceful aroma of burning cedar chips from nearby shake mills. But like timber towns across the <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>, Forks is n't peaceful. Yellow `` solidarity'' ribbons flutter on fenceposts and pickup truck aerials from Forks to <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Willamette </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>, where a Eugene man is selling hundreds of T-shirts that read, `` Save a logger, eat an owl.'' Organized by the timber companies, labor unions and local governments, millworkers and their families are turning out in massive demonstrations. About 1,500 participated in a log truck parade in the <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gorge </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Hood </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>. More than 1,000 rallied at the Oregon Capitol The pain from the shutdown of federal timber sales `` really has n't hit yet. There's still timber in the pipeline from sales before this thing got going,'' said Mayor <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>, adding that it probably will hit just before winter.

<HEAD>Kentucky Ruling May Signal New Life For School Finance Reform Movement</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 In 1964, a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> law student named <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Wise </PERSON> got the novel idea that school funding formulas based on unequal property taxes violated the constitution. Twenty-five years later, that legal theory by a fledgling lawyer has helped change the shape of school finance in some three dozen states. This month, <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> became the latest to feel its effects. That state's highest court ordered the legislature to come up with a new system of public schooling that gives rich and poor kids an even shake. As radical as that may sound, nearly three decades of experience with school funding reform suggests that change in <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> will be slow in coming _ and probably hard fought. By 1967, <PERSON> Wise </PERSON> had spelled out his theories in a book, `` Rich Schools Poor Schools.'' The idea, simple but elegant, was that funding formulas used by virtually all states deny children in poor communities `` equal protection of the law'' as guaranteed by the 14th Amendment. States, and even some educators, have countered that intangibles like dedication count more than money in creating better schools. Reformers like Wise insist that all the dedication in the world wo n't provide kids foreign language teachers and decent science labs. Only money can. Wise's 228-page book became the bible for the budding school finance reform movement. The cause won big victories in the 1970s when civil rights and equity topped the education agenda. One result: the average state share of education spending rose from 40.9 percent in 1970 to an estimated 50.2 percent in 1989, while the local share dipped from 51.8 percent to 43.6 percent, according to <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> statistics. The remaining share is federal aid. Finance reform faded through the 1980s as state money tightened, the property tax revolt spread, and the education reform debate shifted from equity to excellence. But the funding reform movement is showing signs of new life lately. That's especially true in some agricultural states where poor districts, already strapped by declining farm values and lower property tax receipts, nonetheless must meet state mandates for costly school reforms. <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> declared that state's school funding system unconstitutional in February. The Legislature opens a special session on Monday to meet a July 1 deadline to devise a new one. A similar challenge in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> is heading for that state's highest court, as is one in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>. A group of poor <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> districts have banded together to sue that state. In <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision did n't stop at ordering an overhaul of state school funding to make it fairer to poor children. It said the whole school system had to change, top to bottom. `` Lest there be any doubt, the result of our decision is that <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>'s entire system of common schools is unconstitutional,'' wrote Chief Justice <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Stephens </PERSON>. <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> and poor alike `` must be given the same opportunity and access to an adequate education,'' the court ruled in the case brought four years ago by a coalition of 66 `` property poor'' <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> districts. Wise and other school finance experts called the ruling a bombshell, probably the most sweeping of its kind. Yet history suggests change may not be as quick or dramatic as the ruling implies. `` Even when you win, you have to go to the state legislature and start all over again,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Veillette </PERSON>, a school finance specialist at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. It's been 16 years, for example, since <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>'s highest court ruled in <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Cahill </PERSON> that that state's financing system violated the state constitution's education clause guaranteeing a `` thorough and efficient system of free public schools.'' But inequities persist, and lawyers representing poor <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> students will reargue the case in state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> next September. Wise, now director of the <ORGANIZATION> RAND </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corporation </ORGANIZATION>'s Center for the Study of the Teaching Profession in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said that affluent <LOCATION> Moorestown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, spends $ 3,000 more per pupil than East Orange, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>. One result is that <LOCATION> Moorestown </LOCATION> provides one computer per 11 students, compared to one per 43 East Orange pupils <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> state education commissioners have criticized poor districts for the weak quality of schooling `` but have failed along with the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> to provide full equalization,'' Wise said. `` The powers that be would rather regulate than provide money.'' That does n't mean such lawsuits accomplish nothing. It does mean that the national scorecard has been uneven. The legal principles underlying the funding reform movement have fared badly in federal court. They flunked their biggest test in 1973 when the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> sustained <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>' funding system. It held that inequality was an unfortunate but unavoidable byproduct of the principle of local control over schools. That setback led reform advocates to focus on state courts where they found greater success. A recent study of school finance cases by <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Berne </PERSON>, associate dean of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Graduate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, found that state courts have overturned funding systems in 11 states since 1970: <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, and this year, <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>. The first big decision, <PERSON> Serrano </PERSON> vs. Priest in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> in 1971, has meant that per pupil spending is now virtually equal _ within $ 200 per pupil _ in 95 percent of that state's school districts. An added factor was property-tax slashing Proposition 13, which led the state to increase its share of education spending from 37.3 percent in 1970 to 69.1 percent in 1989 to help bail out cash-starved districts. But courts have sustained systems in 10 other states: <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Idaho </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>. Such states typically have defended their funding systems by citing the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> argument that the principle of local control of schooling justified wide spending discrepancies among districts. Many also cited `` effective-schools'' research suggesting that dedication and sound school leadership mean more to learning than money. Wise dismisses such arguments. No research has ever shown, he said, `` that a school with high expectations and no German teacher will produce students who speak German, or that a school with orderly classrooms and no laboratory facilities will train its students to be good scientists.'' The recent history of school finance reform shows, above all, that court rulings, even one so sweeping as in <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, are but a first step in a long, bitter and politically-charged process. As <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Morte </PERSON>, an education professor at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION>, pointed out in a study published in November: `` Initial responses by legislatures or state education agencies to court-ordered reforms have frequently been brought back to courts for later, and often protracted, rounds of deliberation.'' School funding formulas die hard.

<HEAD>Spill Changes Tanker Operations</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By BRUCE BARTLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A small navy of spill response vessels being assembled in Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON> is the most graphic evidence of the changes affecting tanker traffic since the nation's worst oil spill. `` We've had to scour the world for the equipment, and we're still recruiting,'' says <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Alyeska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pipeline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. The consortium of North Slope oil producers operates the trans-Alaska pipeline that carries one-fourth of the nation's oil supply, and the tanker terminal at <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION>. An interim plan <ORGANIZATION> Alyeska </ORGANIZATION> submitted in the face of criticism over its handling of the Exxon Valdez spill provides for a response team of 10 vessels and 48 people capable of skimming nearly 11,000 barrels an hour virtually anywhere in the sound within 10 hours. It also calls for more pilots and escorts for tankers, and Breathalyzer tests for tanker captains and crews. Crew members will be tested before entering the tanker terminal if guards suspect they are intoxicated. <ORGANIZATION> Alyeska </ORGANIZATION> already has denied three people access to their ships; drunken sailors previously were turned over to their captains. Captains now are tested an hour before they sail; if they fail they will be removed from their vessels and authorities will be notified. All those tested apparently have passed the test <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> describes as very unusual. `` I do n't think it's done anywhere else in the world,'' he says. Under a plan in effect March 24, when the <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valdez </ORGANIZATION> ran aground on <LOCATION> Bligh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Reef </LOCATION> and dumped almost 11 million gallons of oil, <ORGANIZATION> Alyeska </ORGANIZATION> promised to have people and equipment on scene within five hours. It took almost 12. Gov. <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Cowper </PERSON> threatened to shut down the pipeline if <ORGANIZATION> Alyeska </ORGANIZATION> did n't come up with something better, and six weeks later it offered the new plan. Before the spill, one tugboat accompanied loaded tankers through the Valdez Narrows into the sound. A state-licensed pilot got off short of <LOCATION> Bligh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Reef </LOCATION>. Under the new system, one tug and a 210-foot `` escort response vessel'' will accompany every loaded tanker to Hinchenbrook Entrance, leading from the sound to the Gulf of <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>. The escort vessel will have two skimmers, almost 14,000 feet of containment boom and storage capacity of 4,000 barrels. Seventy-five to 80 loaded tankers leave <PERSON> Valdez </PERSON> a month, <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> says, and <ORGANIZATION> Alyeska </ORGANIZATION> will have three escorts, enough to handle the tankers in the sound at any one time. State-licensed pilots will accompany tankers past <LOCATION> Bligh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Reef </LOCATION>, the last prominent obstacle between <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hinchenbrook </LOCATION>. From there, tankers must have a federally licensed pilot; some tanker captains also are licensed pilots. Once past Hinchenbrook, all pilotage restrictions are off. When traffic was backed up by weather or loading problems, tankers have always anchored at <LOCATION> Knowles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Head </LOCATION>, a sheltered area on the southwest side of the peninsula between the Port of <PERSON> Fidalgo </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gravina </LOCATION>, about 30 miles south of <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION>. Under the new system, two more vessels will be anchored there around the clock. One will be a tug with a barge capable of holding 140,000 barrels of oil. The other will have equipment to pump oil off a damaged tanker and a storage capacity of 180,000 barrels. Their only responsibility will be responding to a tanker accident. Two storage barges, with a combined capacity 136,000 barrels will be kept in <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION>. Each will carry absorbent material and 16,000 feet of boom. Two tugs will be stationed there to tow the barges to a spill and assist a grounded tanker. A vessel with boom deployment equipment will round out the fleet. Another 8,000 feet of boom will be stored at the tanker terminal, giving <ORGANIZATION> Alyeska </ORGANIZATION> a total of almost 39,000 feet _ almost twice as much as was immediately available for the Exxon Valdez spill. It is still unclear what the new measures will cost. `` Obviously it is in the millions of dollars. How many millions, we ca n't say yet,'' <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> says. One thing that has n't changed is <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> monitoring of tanker traffic. Lt. Cmdr. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Falkenstein </PERSON>, second in command of the Port of <LOCATION> Valdez </LOCATION> marine safety office, emphasizes that the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>'s role is purely advisory as an aid to navigation. `` We do not control their movements. We're not like air traffic controllers.'' The ultimate responsibility always rests with a ship's master, and federal law would have to change to give the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> more authority, he says. `` I do n't anticipate that we're going to begin controlling vessel movements.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> has asked for about $ 12,000 in computer equipment to improve its monitoring, but <PERSON> Falkenstein </PERSON> says he does n't forsee installation of stronger radar. He estimates the cost of providing radar coverage of the entire sound at $ 24 million, not including personnel and housing. Under ideal conditions, he says, the radar will reach just beyond <LOCATION> Bligh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Reef </LOCATION>. Ideal conditions are rare in Prince <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sound </PERSON>, and frequently radar coverage wo n't reach even to the reef. `` Tanker traffic in the port has not changed significantly'' from the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>'s perspective, <PERSON> Falkenstein </PERSON> says. `` It's not business as usual by any stretch. But our procedures have n't changed because there was nothing wrong to begin with.''

<TEXT>
 Pro basketball player <PERSON> Vern </PERSON> <PERSON> Fleming </PERSON> used to worry that when he was hit in the mouth his teeth would spill out onto the court. Years of neglect had left the <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacers </ORGANIZATION> guard's upper teeth decayed and loose Georgia Price never had real teeth, only soft tooth buds barely emerging from her gums where her baby teeth never came in. The <LOCATION> Bloomington </LOCATION> nurse, now 41, received her first dentures at age 3 -LCB- and a second set at 12. Both have found relief with permanent implants, teeth anchored on metal rods supported by frameworks hidden underneath the gums. `` I always thought how wonderful it would be to feel like I have teeth,'' Price said. `` I speak clearer now without my teeth flying across the room.'' Dental implants have been around since the early Egyptians but remain largely unknown among the public. More frustrated denture wearers are receiving them, though, as implants gain wider acceptance among dentists. A <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> conference last year said in a statement that the number of dentists performing implants had grown tenfold in five years and that 300,000 Americans a year will be getting implanted teeth by 1992. Implant dentistry was a $ 150 million industry last year, estimated Dr. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Guaccio </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, president of the 2,000-member <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Implant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dentistry </ORGANIZATION>. Some dentists caution that implants are n't for everyone, particularly those with overriding health problems and those who wo n't give the devices the care and cleaning necessary to prevent infection and prosthetic failure. Few people enjoy having to take dentures out at night, and some are embarrassed to let their spouses or others see them without their false teeth, said Dr. <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION>, who does 300-400 implants a year. `` They eat better, but it's way beyond that from a psychological point of view.'' Sixty percent of the respondents to a marketing survey last year had never heard of implants, said <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>, who directs the faculty at the <ORGANIZATION> Midwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Implant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, which has trained 600 dentists in implantology since 1981. Yet a survey three years ago by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> suggests many people could use them. Forty-two percent of Americans over age 65 and 4 percent of those aged 35 to 64 have no teeth, it reported. The growing older market, a wealthy segment of the population, provides implant dentistry with a tremendous opportunity for growth, and manufacturers have provided a variety of devices, <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> said. `` It's exponential growth. There are fewer and fewer patients we can not treat.'' The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> has reservations. `` In general the feeling is that implants can be used on a selected basis, depending on the patient and the patient's condition,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Wozniak </PERSON>, of <ORGANIZATION> ADA </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> laboratory on certification and product research `` It should only be done on people the dentist feels can properly maintain the implant. It requires meticulous oral hygiene after the device has been placed. So it requires a highly motivated individual.'' Infection around the implant would erode the bone where many of the devices are implanted; lack of adequate bone would immediately eliminate some patients from being implant candidates. One implant, subperiosteal, is not based in bone and consists of a wiry framework fitted between the bone and the gum. Depending on the type, implants can cost as little as $ 600 for a single tooth or as much as $ 10,000 for a full upper or lower arch, and some procedures are covered by <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION>. Most are performed as outpatient surgery. The <ORGANIZATION> NIH </ORGANIZATION> statement said there was little information on long-term effectiveness of implants and called for a national registry to collect data. However, it's generally considered 80 percent to 90 percent of implants are successful for at least five to 10 years. <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>, who inserted the 28-year-old <PERSON> Fleming </PERSON>'s subperiosteal implant, said it should last the rest of his life with proper care. Implants can last 20 years and more, said <PERSON> Guaccio </PERSON>, estimating that after 18 years, `` about 87 percent of the implants I've ever placed are still functioning in the mouth.''

<HEAD>Outlook For Sea Cows Bleak As Boat Traffic Increases</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A groggy volunteer crew of five gathered early New Year's Day and raced to where a 500-pound sea cow had been found with deep gashes from a boat propeller in its grayish-brown, leathery back. But the West Indian manatee was n't injured in the congested Intracoastal Waterway, it was the <LOCATION> Everglades </LOCATION>. `` It shows you they are n't safe anywhere,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Bossart </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> Seaquarium veterinarian and pathologist. Besides the unmistakable prop marks, the manatee had three fractured ribs and a punctured lung. The injuries caused a bubble to form inside the animal, leaving it floating helplessly. The manatee _ dubbed <PERSON> Marjory </PERSON> after <PERSON> Marjory </PERSON> <PERSON> Stoneman </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON>, a protector of the <LOCATION> Everglads </LOCATION> _ has been recovering at the <ORGANIZATION> Seaquarium </ORGANIZATION>, one of two marine parks _ the other is <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> <LOCATION> World </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION> _ in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> that are authorized to rescue the protected animal An estimated 1,200 of the prehistoric-looking creatures live in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, based on aerial surveys. The docile, plant-eating creatures, weighing more than 3,000 pounds and ranging from eight to 14 feet long, are found from northern <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> to as far north <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. They face a growing threat from <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s development boom. A total of 133 manatee deaths were reported last year, including a record 43 from being hit by boats; there were 39 boat-related deaths in 1987. The 45 deaths so far this year exceeds the 1987 period. Through March, 15 deaths have been blamed on boats, and 23 carcasses were recovered last month alone. `` Our guess is that the numbers increased through the'60s and'70s as there was more protection, but in the'80s they've held about steady,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Ackerman </PERSON>, a state marine mammal researcher. `` If that's the case, the fact that deaths are increasing is of considerable concern.'' Even if boat-related deaths were reduced, the manatee faces other obstacles such as a low reproductive rate and diminishing habitat, officials say. `` We're not that optimistic. ... Their ability to recover from any kind of problem is limited, even if everything was perfect,'' <PERSON> Ackerman </PERSON> said. The rehabilitation of injured manatees is a painstaking process that takes months. There is also the question of what awaits them and babies born in captivity once they are returned to the wild. `` There's no problem with breeding in the wild. The problem we have is habitat destruction,'' said <PERSON> J.P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Garner </PERSON>, assistant manager of <LOCATION> Homosassa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, where nine manatees are kept. Manatees rely on seagrass beds for food and have begun to congregate around the warm-water discharges of power plants, where boat traffic is often heavy. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Rose </PERSON>, a marine mammal coordinator for the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION>, said <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> is focusing efforts on tying manatee protection to county growth management plans. In addition, there has been an extensive campaign to increase public awareness about the creatures' plight. Singer-songwriter <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Buffet </PERSON> gave a big boost to the manatee cause eight years ago when he became chairman of the `` Save the <ORGANIZATION> Manatee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>,'' which now boasts an international membership of about 22,000. `` They have absolutely no ability to be aggressive,'' said <PERSON> Rose </PERSON>. `` People identify with them as the ultimate victim.'' More than five months after being picked up, <PERSON> Marjory </PERSON> remains in guarded but stable condition in a Seaquarium tank, <PERSON> Bossart </PERSON> said. `` She's feeling a lot better and is able to dive better.'' Unlike many others of the gentle mammals, she still has a fighting chance.

<HEAD>Occidental To Redevelop Oil Field Where 167 Workers Were Killed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> says it plans to redevelop the <LOCATION> Piper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alpha </LOCATION> oil field where 167 workers were killed last summer in the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> oil industry's worst disaster. <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday that its new single, fixed platform, would keep the main controls and sleeping quarters `` completely isolated'' from the drilling and processing equipment. Most of the victims of the July 1988 explosion and fire died in an accommodation area located near processing equipment. Some industry critics since have called on oil companies to remove living areas from drilling platforms. A public inquiry into the cause of the disaster is currently under way. <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> said it awarded contracts worth 175 million pounds, or approximately $ 264 million, to four British companies for the redevelopment. `` We are fully sympathetic towards the people still trying to come to terms with their grief following last year's tragic accident,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Brading </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> U.K. </ORGANIZATION>, whose parent company <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> is based in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. `` The company must also be mindful of its responsibilities to its 1,000 employees in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kingdom </LOCATION> and a further 2,500 people who will find jobs as a direct result of these contract awards.'' The company said it hopes to get the field back into production in 1992. The consortium operating the field, made up of <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Britain </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Lasmo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, have agreed on the plans for the project. The new rig will be designed to handle 120,000 barrels of oil a day for export via the existing pipeline system leading to the Occidental consortium's oil handling terminal at <LOCATION> Flotta </LOCATION>, in the <LOCATION> Orkney </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>. The old rig produced 160,000 barrels a day. <PERSON> Brading </PERSON> said that the platform's new design `` incorporates all of the lessons learned to date from the disaster and has the flexibility to include any recommendations ... following the conclusion of the Piper inquiry.'' `` Our intention is that the new production facilities will include state-of-the-art safety concepts and technology,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> said it shortly would submit the redevelopment plans to the government for approval. The contracts were awarded to <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Root </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vickers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> McDermott </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scotland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>; and <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Offshore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Insurance Firm Can't Meet Debt Payments</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Integrated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s stock price plunged nearly 50 percent after the insurance and mutual fund company said it was halting payment on $ 864 million in short-term debt. Integrated, which has $ 7.8 billion in assets, said Thursday the problem affects only the parent company and not its affiliates and subsidiaries nationwide, which would continue to make payments to creditors. On Wednesday, banks withdrew Integrated's access to short-term credit markets amid signs of weakening financial condition at the firm. Integrated said it did not have the money to pay off its debt, including some $ 373 million in commercial paper and loan shares that come due in the next 45 days. The debt payments amount to about $ 8 million a day. Integrated also has $ 491 million in short-term bank credit lines mostly payable on demand. The company's stock plunged $ 5.75 to close at $ 6.25 a share in <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> trading Thursday. Volume was 1.7 million shares, about four times the trading activity on Wednesday. The stock closed at $ 15.37 -LCB- on Tuesday. `` The company believes it has a short-term liquidity problem,'' Integrated spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Caouette </PERSON> said. `` We're working with a group of banks and ... negotiations are being closely held and they're progressing.'' Integrated, founded in 1969, is a diversified financial services company with operations in mutual funds and money management, limited partnerships, and life insurance and annuities. It has $ 1.1 billion in capital. Analysts said Integrated has fared poorly in recent years as it expanded but was unable to establish a foothold in the insurance field. The company also says it has had problems because of high up-front costs such as fees, commissions and carrying costs for investments later sold as partnerships. Integrated issued a statement saying it had scheduled a meeting of creditors and short-term credit suppliers for Monday to discuss reaching a debt restructuring package. Integrated has said it is trying to arrange new credit with some of its banks and exploring other sources of capital. On Wednesday, its investment banker, <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, halted sales of Integrated's short-term commercial paper. <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Poor </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, the debt-rating service, on Thursday lowered Integrated's rating on bonds, preferred stock and commercial paper affecting about $ 1.2 billion in securities. It was the second rating downgrade in two days.

But what is n't clear is whether loyal ex-colleagues will follow the Pied Piper of junk bonds to his new firm _ and how long the venture will last with <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> facing a lengthy jail term. <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>, 42, resigned Thursday after 19 years at <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>, where he began a wildly successful career that helped reshape corporate <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> in the 1980s through the pioneering use of low-grade securities called junk bonds. <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>, who made a reported $ 550 million in 1987, said he is forming a consulting firm to assist companies that want to raise money to start up, grow or stay in business. But he faces $ 1.85 billion in forfeitures of alleged illegal profits and a lengthy jail term if convicted on a 98-count fraud and racketeering indictment, the government's largest securities crime prosecution to date. People involved in <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>'s plans for the new firm, <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assets </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> does not intend to raid <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, junk bond division, which he founded and ran until his March indictment The principals in the new firm, which now has a handful of employees and a temporary <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> office, are not going to be `` <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> people,'' <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> associates said. But <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> still commands tremendous loyalty among some key junk bond employees and <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> clients, and no one is ruling out defections. <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> associates did not release details on his plans, including whether an affiliated brokerage would be formed. A <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the Wall Street giant does not anticipate conflicts with <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>'s new firm because it will not be in the brokerage business. Under <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>'s still-to-be-approved settlement of civil insider trading and other fraud charges with the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> and its employees are barred from doing business with <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>, directly or indirectly. The <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> official said the provision likely will be reviewed on a case-by-case basis, so some contact between the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> investment firm's clients and <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> may occur. For instance, <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> may be able to refer clients to <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> and vice versa but not receive any fees. <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>'s resignation ends the relationship between one of the most important financial players of the decade and the firm he helped boost from a second-tier brokerage to the nation's fifth largest. `` <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> made many important contributions to <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION>, and his resignation, although not unexpected, is a sad event,'' <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> stated. `` We wish him well in his new endeavor.'' <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> widely was credited with creating a $ 175 billion-a-year junk bond market. His pitchman sale of the bonds _ previously used mainly by companies with low credit ratings _ helped fuel the decade's corporate takeover mania by giving smaller companies and corporate raiders a tool for financing growth, mergers and takeovers. But the federal government alleges <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> used his powers through <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> to engage in a range of securities crimes, including schemes with now-jailed stock speculator <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>. He also is accused of insider trading in a separate <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> lawsuit. No settlement has been reached and no trial scheduled in that case. <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> had been on leave from <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> since his criminal indictment. His brother, <PERSON> Lowell </PERSON>, who also was charged in the case, announced Thursday he was quitting the firm to return to practicing law. `` I am naturally disappointed to be forced to leave <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> as part of the firm's settlement with the government, but I look forward to the opportunity of helping people build companies,'' <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> said in a statement. <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> joined <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> full-time in 1970 after graduating from the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pennsylvania </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Wharton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. In 1978, he moved <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>'s junk bond division to <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>'s trial in federal court in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> is set for next March. He is free under a $ 700 million bond package. Lawyers close to the case indicated <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>'s decision to resign was calculated. By quitting, <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> pre-empts the firm's agreement with the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> to dismiss him once the settlement is approved by a federal judge. With <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>'s resignation, lawyers may argue that parts of the <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> pact are moot and mount further challenges. They also are expected to challenge the provision barring <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> from doing business with the same clients.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Thermos </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> built its business on keeping hot drinks hot, but some construction workers who sip their lunchtime coffee from Thermos bottles say the company's sale to a Japanese firm leaves them cold. `` The Japanese are buying up <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Derryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Caldwell </PERSON>, a hardhat working downtown. `` We like American-made products because it gives jobs to Americans and helps our economy.'' Electrician <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Callahan </PERSON> said he'd stop buying Thermos products if new owner <PERSON> Nippon </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanso </PERSON> <PERSON> K.K </PERSON>. moves the company's manufacturing plants out of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. But <ORGANIZATION> Nippon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sanso </ORGANIZATION> has no such plans for Thermos, according to <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> Vice President <PERSON> Yasuo </PERSON> <PERSON> Kezuka </PERSON>, who helped arrange the $ 134 million purchase from <ORGANIZATION> Household </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The deal was announced Thursday. <PERSON> Kezuka </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Nippon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sanso </ORGANIZATION> will retain all of Thermos' operations, which include a propane-grill factory and corporate headquarters in <LOCATION> Freeport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, a factory in <LOCATION> Batesville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miss. </LOCATION>, two plants in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kingdom </LOCATION> and one in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. A Thermos plant in <LOCATION> Taftville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, is being closed and is not included in the sale, said <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Slade </PERSON>, Thermos' personnel director in <LOCATION> Freeport </LOCATION>. The company employs 1,900 people worldwide. <PERSON> Kezuka </PERSON> relayed a statement from <ORGANIZATION> Nippon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sanso </ORGANIZATION>, which already has a line of steel vacuum bottles, saying the company `` will try to make good synergy by combining the Japanese technique and the famous Thermos brand. They will try to keep a leading position in the housewares products area.'' <ORGANIZATION> Nippon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sanso </ORGANIZATION> is a major manufacturer of industrial gas and is diversifying into consumer products, Household International said. Thermos invented the glass vacuum bottle in 1907 and developed a large line of insulated containers for toting food and drink. Although it is best known for its bottles and lunchboxes, including the cartoon-character lunchbuckets that are still popular with children, Thermos also makes gas grills, insulated coolers and other household and recreational products. Household International, based in the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Prospect </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heights </LOCATION>, said it expects to close the cash transaction by the end of August. Thermos is the largest of six manufacturing subsidiaries put on the block by Household, which hopes to focus its business on financial services. It owns <ORGANIZATION> Household </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. Thermos had sales of about $ 194 million in 1988. Household said in January it planned to divest all of its manufacturing operations. In April it spun off to its shareholders three manufacturing companies: <ORGANIZATION> Eljer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Scotsman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Schwitzer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The company expects to sell its five remaining manufacturing companies by the end of the summer, said spokesman <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartney </PERSON>. They are: GC-Thorsen, <ORGANIZATION> Albion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION>, King-Sealy, <ORGANIZATION> Omni </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> WaterTest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Paramount Increasing Pressure on Time, Prods Board for Response</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, still awaiting a response to its unwanted $ 10.7 billion takeover bid for <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, has stepped up the pressure on the media giant by indicating it might sweeten its offer. But investors were unimpressed Thursday by the prospect of a higher bid for Time. The company's stock fell $ 3.62 -LCB- to $ 171.50 a share on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> on reports the Time board was leaning toward making a cash tender offer for <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> as a way to foil <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 175-a-share bid. Time and <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> previously agreed to merge in an all-stock deal. In a letter sent Thursday to <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION>'s directors, <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said, `` Since our offer commenced, no representative of <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> has contacted us to discuss our proposal.'' The Time board, which was considering how to fight Paramount and whether it could salvage Time's merger with <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>, seemed to be in no rush to reply to the offer or <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>' letter. Time spokesman <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Adler </PERSON> said the company had no comment on the letter and would not say when it would respond. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Sard </PERSON>, a spokesman for Paramount, an entertainment and publishing conglomerate, declined to comment on the purpose of the letter, saying it `` speaks for itself.'' However, observers said the letter was intended to pressure the Time board. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said Paramount might be willing to raise its bid if a review of Time's financial records justified a higher offer. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> called for a meeting between the two companies at which Paramount could examine Time's books. Time stock _ which has traded as high as $ 182.75 a share since the <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> bid was announced _ fell on the prospect of a Time bid for <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>, which cast doubt on the Paramount offer. Time has a $ 5 billion line of credit that it could use to help finance a bid. An offer for <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> was one of several options the Time board was believed to be considering. The others included a recapitalization of the company, a cash tender offer for Paramount or a continued pursuit of its planned merger with <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> also could launch a cash tender offer for Time. Stock in <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION>, formerly called <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, was unchanged at $ 59.50 a share Thursday, while <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> picked up 62 -LCB- cents to close at $ 55.62 -LCB- a share. Under the planned <ORGANIZATION> Time-Warner </ORGANIZATION> merger, <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> stockholders would get a share in the new company for each share they own while <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> shareholders would get 0.465 of a share of the new company for each of their <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> shares. However, if the two companies were to pursue their merger, it was widely expected the deal would have to be renegotiated because <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION>'s stock price has soared from the $ 126 level it fetched before Paramount announced its bid. In a separate development Thursday, Time and <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> said <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> city officials approved the proposed transfers in ownership of the six cable franchises in the city owned by either Time or <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>. Time and <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> together own cable systems serving about 5.5 million subscribers, but must get permission from local cable authorities in each case to combine their respective operations under a <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> umbrella.

<HEAD>Gerber, Bristol-Myers Plan To Market Infant Formula to Moms</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A pediatricians' group is upset with plans by the baby food maker <ORGANIZATION> Gerber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> to market a new infant formula directly to parents rather than through physicians. <PERSON> Gerber </PERSON> disclosed Thursday that it would break with the customary practice in the infant formula business by advertising its new Gerber Baby Formula in television commercials and direct mailings to parents starting in August. The new formula, which will be manufactured by <ORGANIZATION> Bristol-Myers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, already a big player in the $ 1.65 billion infant formula market, will be available starting in September. The proposed marketing approach immediately drew fire from the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pediatrics </ORGANIZATION>, which opposes advertising infant formula to consumers for fear that it would discourage breast feeding. `` I'm disappointed that <PERSON> Gerber </PERSON> _ with an impeccable reputation in the field of infant nutrition _ would resort to this tactic,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON>, associate executive director of the academy, based in <LOCATION> Elk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grove </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>. Gerber officials said their ads would emphasize that breast feeding is the preferred method for feeding infants They said it would also encourage mothers to talk with their physicians before deciding on a formula. The announcement was unusual in that it links <PERSON> Gerber </PERSON>, which has twice discontinued infant formula products, with a company that is already a major factor in that business. Bristol-Myers, based in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, claims a 37 percent share of the market, with products including <LOCATION> Enfamil </LOCATION> and ProSobee. <ORGANIZATION> Abbott </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> has about 52.3 percent of the market, while <ORGANIZATION> Amrican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> is third at 9.7 percent, according to <PERSON> Gerber </PERSON>'s figures. Under the agreement, Bristol-Myers will manufacture the new formula and be responsible for assuring the quality of the product, while Gerber market it. `` Infant formula is a logical extension to our 61-year dedication to helping parents feed babies,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Gerber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> division at the Fremont, Mich.-based company. <PERSON> Gerber </PERSON> makes about 180 baby food products. The formula will be available in powdered, concentrated liquid and ready-to-use liquid forms. <PERSON> Gerber </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Poole </PERSON> his company sold an infant formula called <PERSON> Modilac </PERSON> for about 10 years ending in the mid-1960s. It was discontinued because it was too costly to make and sell at a competitive price. He said <PERSON> Gerber </PERSON> had also made a special formula for infants who could not tolerate milk but discontinued it about three years ago. Bristol-Myers spokesman <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubber </PERSON> said his company approached <PERSON> Gerber </PERSON> about marketing a new line of formula. `` Gerber has a food reputation in this market. We feel they have a chance to strengthen our position in the market,'' he said. He said the Gerber product also will give Bristol-Myers another outlet for formula. Bristol-Myers sells its infant formula through pediatricians while Gerber Baby Formula will be sold in stores. Infant formula makers have generally avoided marketing directly to parents. But last year, <ORGANIZATION> Carnation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> came out with two formula products, Good Start and Good Nature, that were initially promoted directly to parents. The company has quit marketing <ORGANIZATION> Good </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Start </ORGANIZATION> to parents, reportedly under pressure from pediatricians and the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, but still markets Good Nature formula for older babies to parents. <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON> of the pediatrician's group said he `` can not help but wonder if there is a subliminal message here that says if you choose not to breast feed, here is an alternative just as good.'' <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON>, a spokesman for the Minneapolis-based advocacy group <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corporate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accountability </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Gerber </PERSON> has a built-in conflict by advocating breast feeding while selling a substitute. `` They will only make money when moms choose not to breast feed,'' he said.

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar today suffered its biggest single-day plunge in recent years against the Japanese yen, traders said, while stock prices gained moderately. The dollar closed at 145.05 yen, down from Thursday's closing of 151.30 yen. The 6.25-yen drop was reportedy the dollar's largest daily fluctuation between sessions ever, though an official of the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's central bank, said no records were available. Several traders contacted by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> said they could not remember a larger day-to-day loss. The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, which lost 489.90 points Thursday in its largest single-day loss this year, recouped 142.08 points, or 0.43 percent, to finish the week at 33,055.17. Volume traded on the first section totaled 500 million shares, up from 650 million the previous day. Traders attributed the dollar's retreat to concerted intervention overnight by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and European central banks in overseas markets. The <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> was reported to have sold $ 200 million to $ 300 million this morning to accelerate the currency's downward trend, they said. An official of <ORGANIZATION> Fuji </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, a major Japanese commercial bank, said the dollar `` made a major correction'' after weeks of excessive rallies against other currencies. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported Thursday the nation's merchandise trade deficit fell to $ 8.26 billion in April from March's revised deficit of $ 9.54 billion Stock dealers said trading was thin in anticipation of the release of further <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic indicators, including the nation's consumer price figures for May, due later today in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>

 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar rallied somewhat today in early European trading after plunging in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. Gold prices were higher. Traders said reports of coordinated central bank intervention _ intended to bring the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency down _ had tended to strengthen the dollar. They said sentiment remained much in favor of the dollar and attributed Thursday's substantial single-day drop in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to technical selling. `` The -LRB- dollar's -RRB- drop was just too much. Sentiment can not have changed so radically,'' said one Italian trader. He said the central bank intervention was n't heavy enough to affect rates and the dollar remained well bid. Another Italian trader noted that `` many European banks found the dollar at relatively cheap levels this morning and started buying the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. unit.'' The West German <ORGANIZATION> Bundesbank </ORGANIZATION> started the intervention early today and was followed by several other European central banks. However, traders said the intervention was modest. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, the dollar suffered its biggest single-day plunge in recent years today but rallied in later European trading. The dollar fell 6.25 yen to a closing 145.05 yen in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. Later in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it was quoted at a higher rate of 147.05 yen. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the dollar fell against the British pound. It cost $ 1.53075 to buy one pound, more expensive than $ 1.5195 late Thursday. Other dollar rates at midmorning, compared with late Thursday included: 2.0055 West German marks, down from 2.0235; 1.7290 Swiss francs, down from 1.7490; 6.8068 French francs, down from 6.8680; 2.2459 Dutch guilders, down from 2.2915; 1,451.50 Italian lire, down from 1,472.00, and 1.1985 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1993. Gold opened in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> at $ 365.80 a troy ounce, compared with late Thursday's $ 362.50. At midmorning, the city's five major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $ 365.35. In <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, the bid price was $ 365.80 compared with $ 361.71 late Thursday. Earlier in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, gold rose $ 5.10 to close at $ 366.67.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The administration is hailing the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> version of savings and loan bailout legislation as a major victory for taxpayers after the resounding defeat of an attempt to weaken President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s key reform proposal. Shortly before 11 p.m. Thursday, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> capped a 13-hour session by voting 320-97 to solve the worst financial crisis since the Depression with the most expensive government bailout in history. It will cost, according to the congressional <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, $ 285 billion over 30 years _ $ 157 billion of that from taxpayers. The legislation also includes a series of what <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has labeled `` never again'' provisions. In what the president identified as the heart of his proposal, it requires <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L owners to risk more of their own money in a capital cushion between S & amp; L losses and the government deposit insurance fund. `` The <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> taxpayers won a major victory today when the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION> voted for strong, tangible capital requirements for the nation's savings and loans,'' Treasury Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> said in a statement. `` We applaud the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> leadership for moving this bill rapidly through the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>,'' said <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>. The House action paves the way for a conference early next month with the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, which passed its S & amp; L bill in April, and for final enactment before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> goes on vacation in August. The sharpest conflict between the two chambers will likely be on their funding plans. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> would allow <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to keep some S & amp; L spending out of the budget deficit through a plan to sell bonds through a new quasi-private agency. But the Democratic-dominated <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> would swell the deficit by $ 44 billion, increasing pressure on the administration to agree to a tax increase, in a bid to cut long-term interest costs. On capital, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> would require S & amp; L owners to risk $ 3 in `` real money'' capital for every $ 100 in lending, while the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> standard is $ 1.50. Despite heavy industry lobbying, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, on a 326-94 vote, rejected an amendment offered by Rep. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hyde </PERSON>, R-Ill., which would have given 241 S & amp; Ls a chance, through an administrative appeal, to win exemption from new capital requirements <PERSON> Hyde </PERSON> was arguing on behalf of institutions currently benefiting from an accounting break known as `` supervisory good will.'' Regulators granted the $ 19.7 billion break to institutions, many of them in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, that took ailing institutions off the government's hands in the early 1980s Supervisory good will allows many of them to operate without risking any of their owners' money. <PERSON> Hyde </PERSON> said the government should keep its word, but his critics said the policy change was warranted because of the huge bill to taxpayers. Earlier this week, <PERSON> Hyde </PERSON> appeared to have a good chance of success, but Thursday morning <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> threatened to veto the bill if <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members adopted the amendment. `` There should be no mistake. This matter goes to the very heart of my determination to clean up the abuses of the past among the savings and loans, about which every voter is entitled to be outraged,'' the president wrote.

 <ORGANIZATION> G.D. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Searle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> has agreed to settle the claims and lawsuits of more than 100 people linked to its Copper-7 contraceptive device, but a spokeswoman said about 350 other cases still are pending in courts. The agreement, which requires approval from the affected clients of the <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> law firm of <ORGANIZATION> Robins </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Kaplan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ciresi </PERSON>, bars disclosure of any details, said <PERSON> Searle </PERSON> spokeswoman <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> <PERSON> Bruno </PERSON>. The settlement also bars the parties from disclosing how many individuals were covered by the settlement, although the law firm previously said it represented more than 100 people. Even so, Ms. <PERSON> Bruno </PERSON> said the settlement leaves about 350 other Copper-7 lawsuits in state and federal courts. `` At last count, 330 cases involving the Copper-7 had been disposed of in our favor. Of the 19 that went to trial, we won 15 and lost four,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Bruno </PERSON>. `` Two of those are pending appeal and of the two completed, we have paid a total of about $ 300,000,'' she added. Ms. <PERSON> Bruno </PERSON> confirmed the June 9 agreement in response to questions from reporters. She also said the settlement `` does not have a materially adverse effect'' on the financial positions of <LOCATION> Searle </LOCATION> or its parent, <ORGANIZATION> Monsanto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Women who have brought lawsuits against the Skokie-based pharmaceutical concern contend the Copper-7, once one of the nation's most widely prescribed intrauterine devices, caused pelvic inflammations, ectopic pregnancies or perforation of the uterus, and could result in infertility A <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> lawyer whose firm is representing clients in 40 lawsuits and evaluating the claims of several hundred more called the settlement `` a hopeful sign.'' `` I could n't estimate what the settlement may have been worth. My guess is, that like our firm, <PERSON> Robins </PERSON>, <PERSON> Kaplan </PERSON>, <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> had one group of cases pending in court and a second group whose cases were being investigated for possible lawsuits,'' attorney <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Erwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said from <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>. `` Typically, IUD cases can range from $ 10,000 if the causation is weak and the injury nominal to $ 250,000 or more if you have a young, married couple rendered childless due to an infection from an IUD.'' <PERSON> Searle </PERSON> pulled the product from the market, along with a second IUD, in January 1986, citing the high costs stemming from hundreds of lawsuits.

 A new magazine devoted to the pros and cons of biodegradable diapers and other ways of dealing with debris promises to do more than just talk trash. If you say, `` What garbage!'' you're not a likely reader of Garbage. But the publishers of this new magazine say the `` throwaway society'' has gone beyond the concern of the counterculture to become a mainstream issue. `` I think we all feel vaguely uneasy and vaguely guilty when you bring the groceries home and realize that 60 percent of what you've bought is packaging,'' said editor-publisher <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Poore </PERSON> Formally known as `` Garbage: The Practical Journal for the Environment,'' it will start publishing in August. <PERSON> Ms. </PERSON> <PERSON> Poore </PERSON>, 33, said it will have a pro-environment tilt but she promises to be even-handed. `` You have to be pro-environment if you want any quality of life and possibly if you want any life at all,'' she said, but her magazine will also print the downside to proposed solutions to environmental problems. When an environmentally sound way of doing things turns out to be more costly, especially for the poor, Garbage will so report, said Ms. <PERSON> Poore </PERSON>. `` There often is no easy solution,'' she said. The first question the magazine had to confront was whether it should be printed on recycled paper. The answer may seem obvious, Ms. <PERSON> Poore </PERSON> said, but it was not. `` The editor in me wanted recycled paper,'' she said. `` The publisher in me did n't. `` Recycled paper looks like whole wheat,'' she said. -LRB- This was the publisher speaking. -RRB- `` It has gooky things in it. They say it will break on the press. `` The publisher in me said there was nothing wrong with premium paper. And the printer told us they would charge 30 percent more to print it on recycled paper!'' But the art director and the managing editor marched in and said Ms. <PERSON> Poore </PERSON> would be a hypocrite if she printed Garbage on virgin paper. The printer, in environmentally conscious <LOCATION> Burlington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vt. </LOCATION>, relented and promised to charge nothing extra for the first three issues and see how things come out. Research located a recycled paper that `` is very white, and film coated and is easily recyclable itself,'' <PERSON> Ms. </PERSON> <PERSON> Poore </PERSON> said, so the environment -LRB- and the editor -RRB- won the battle, for the moment. Ms. <PERSON> Poore </PERSON> owns The <ORGANIZATION> Old-House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION>, which, like Garbage, is based in <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>, N.Y. The Old-House Journal was a neighborhood paper for owners of brownstones in <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> when she bought it 11 years ago, just as the preservation movement was catching on. It now has a circulation `` approaching 165,000.'' Garbage, she said, will be the only environmental magazine that is not issued by activists and therefore free `` to have a sense of humor.'' `` If you're the <ORGANIZATION> Sierra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, you've got to take a worst-case view and a sense of humor is a dangerous thing to have,'' she said. The pros and cons of biodegradable diapers will be examined in the first issue. Pro: they self-destruct. Con: they introduce human waste into landfills and possibly water tables. The magazine's conclusion: cloth diapers are better, from the environment's point of view. In a solicitation for subscriptions that was mailed to 700,000 homes a week ago -LRB- printed on recycled paper, too -RRB-, Ms. <PERSON> Poore </PERSON> explains the choice of the magazine's name: `` Here we were, planning a new environmental journal, but my staff and I found ourselves referring to it as ` the garbage magazine.' It dawned on us that that was the right name ... It does n't beat around the <PERSON> bush </PERSON>, but goes right to the heart of the problem: our throwaway society.''

 Fathers who take time off for the birth of a baby will become the majority in the coming decade, says a new study that finds dads joining moms in the struggle to cope with work and family responsibilities. `` Balancing work and family responsibilities is becoming a total work force issue, not just a women's issue,'' reports <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Burud </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Burud </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Pasadena </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, in the analysis `` The 1990s Father: Balancing Work & amp; Family Concerns.'' `` We tend to think working moms have a monopoly on guilt, but it's not true,'' added <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Levine </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. While fathers continue to face traditional pressure to do well at work, they also want to spend more time with their children, reported <PERSON> Levine </PERSON>. He and <PERSON> Burud </PERSON> were among several researchers included in the study compiled by the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION>, an independent <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> research group. Men are `` feeling that they're repeating the same pattern of their own fathers, not being around enough,'' noted <PERSON> Levine </PERSON> in the analysis issued to coincide with Fathers Day. A generation ago it would not have occurred to most new fathers to take time off for the birth of a child, an increasingly common practice today, said <PERSON> Barney </PERSON> <PERSON> Olmstead </PERSON>, co-director of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ways </LOCATION> to Work in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Pleck </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Wheaton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Norton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, predicts that fathers taking time off for the birth of a child will become increasingly commonplace. In the 1990s, he said, `` it will become the dominant pattern for fathers to take one or two weeks off and that the proportion of fathers who take longer periods of time will grow. `` Men are spending more time with their kids, and men and women are sharing the time they're staying home with sick children,'' reported <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> of Child Care Management Resources in <LOCATION> Bethesda </LOCATION>, Md. `` But when child-care arrangements break down, it still is the woman who misses work more often than the man.'' <PERSON> Fran </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodgers </PERSON> of Work-Family Directions reported that many men are beginning to seek a balance between work and family _ `` they do n't want to work overtime, they do n't want to relocate, and they do n't want their performance measured in terms of hours put in on the job `` The intensity of feelings is greater for women, but they're there for both'' she said While so-called `` family-friendly'' company policies have largely concentrated on women, more and more they will need to consider males also, according to the study. `` Fathers still define themselves primarily in the family as the provider,'' observed <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Segal </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> firm <ORGANIZATION> Family </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION>. But, he added, they also are increasingly wanting to be with their children. `` Fathers are connecting with their kids, their young kids, in a stronger way, and there are expectations for them to connect in a stronger way than their fathers had, and that sets up the conflicts for the father as he moves through his career,'' <PERSON> Segal </PERSON> said. But, he added, `` It's not altogether socially acceptable for men to stay home when their kids are sick and such.'' Some companies are in the early stages of developing ways to aid working fathers, commented <PERSON> Levine </PERSON>, who operates the Fatherhood Project at <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> BNA </ORGANIZATION> study said that where child-care facilities are provided, fathers are increasingly likely to use the facilities and increasingly often are the ones taking children to medical appointments and for other obligations. Yet, said <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, these are relatively rare occasions. `` You either have to be in a very senior position where you can call your own shots, or be a specialist,'' she said.

 For the first time since President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was elected on a no-tax-increase pledge, a congressional subcommittee has voted to raise taxes. The House Ways and Means subcommittee on human resources is calling for a boost in the tax that employers pay for federal unemployment benefits, which would bring in an estimated $ 10.6 billion over the next five years. When fully in effect in 1992, it would cost employers an additional $ 4 a year for each employee. The increase would finance improvements in jobless benefits and higher spending for child care and welfare. It would also leave $ 161 million next year, and $ 1.7 billion over five years, toward reducing the budget deficit. The package was approved by the subcommittee on a voice vote over Republican opposition. It now goes to the full committee. Before the vote, <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gideon </PERSON>, assistant treasury secretary for tax policy, said the administration is strongly opposed. In the first place, he said, the unemployment fund does not need more money _ a statement that was challenged by Democrats on the panel. `` Second,'' <PERSON> Gideon </PERSON> wrote, `` increasing the amount of wages subject to federal unemployment tax is a tax increase and is opposed by this administration.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was elected after a campaign in which his opposition to a tax increase was repeated several times a day. He also has predicted that if taxes were raised, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would spend the money rather than cut the deficit. `` It's basically a $ 10 billion tax increase ... and a wish list of social spending,'' Rep. <PERSON> Hank </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, R-Colo., a member of the subcommittee, said of the bill `` Many of the proposals have merit but I do n't think we have the money.'' He predicted the tax increase will make it far more difficult for the <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> to meet its deficit-reduction goal. Present law requires employers to pay a tax of 0.8 percent of the first $ 7,000 earned annually by each employee, a maximum of $ 56 per worker. The rate is due to drop to 0.6 percent in 1991. The subcommittee's bill would raise the taxable wage to $ 8,000 in 1990, $ 9,000 in 1991 and $ 10,000 in 1992. Thus, the employer's maximum tax per employee would rise to $ 60 Rep. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Downey </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, chairman of the subcommittee, rejected the administration's argument that the trust funds from which unemployment compensation are paid need no extra money. `` These accounts currently do not have enough funds on reserve to cover increased outlays if a recession occurs in the next few years,'' <PERSON> Downey </PERSON> wrote in presenting his recommendation to the subcommittee. He noted the administration's estimates are based on economic assumptions that many economists say are too rosy. `` Even with the administration's optimistic assumptions over the next five years, the administration has projected that the loan account -LRB- which helps states replenish their jobless benefits -RRB- will not have enough reserves by the end of 1994, when its shortfall will be $ 3.5 billion,'' <PERSON> Downey </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Gideon </PERSON> also opposed the tax increase on grounds that because of the way the unemployment-benefits system is structured, raising the federal tax would automatically increase employers' state taxes. Among the spending improvements voted by the subcommittee were a $ 1.77 billion increase in federal grants to states for such social services as Meals on Wheels and child-care services; a boost in Supplemental Security Income, a welfare program for elderly and disabled, of $ 2 a month for individuals -LRB- to $ 370 -RRB- and $ 3 a month for couples -LRB- to $ 553 -RRB-; and making it easier for states to trigger payment of extended unemployment benefits for the long-term jobless.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is taking the first step toward nationwide random alcohol testing of airline pilots, train engineers, ships' officers, pipeline workers and bus and truck drivers. Transportation Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday he had asked department lawyers to examine rule-making that would expand the department's random drug-testing program to include alcohol. Rules on drug testing of 4 million transportation workers take effect at the end of the year. <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> said alcohol testing raises complex issues and should not begin hastily as proposed in a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> bill requiring random testing for both drugs and alcohol among railroad workers. <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> said he would recommend that President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> veto that bill, if adopted, because it would require the department to start over with its testing program. <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> testified at a hearing of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> which is considering its own version of mandatory drug and alcohol testing for transportation workers. The <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> last November ordered drug testing programs in private transportation industries, but the programs face several court challenges and the congressional bills would give testing the force of law. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> has approved some drug testing but has yet to rule on random testing. At the hearing, the proposed <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> bill brought general support from transportation industry representatives and strong objections from groups representing the employees who would be tested. The bill is nearly identical to measures passed by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, but not the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, in both 1987 and 1988. `` I have decided that we must step forward and address the issue of alcohol misuse in transportation now,'' <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> told the committee. He noted that a <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> program of mandatory post-accident alcohol testing for the maritime industry begins in December, but said more thought is needed before extending the testing to other modes of transportation. He noted that alcohol is legal while the drug testing covers illegal substances. <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> said the House version of the anti-drug bill would mandate random alcohol test rules just 90 days after enactment of the bill. `` I look to the long term, and I know that to develop a program that will achieve its objective and withstand legal challenge requires more care and consideration,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hollings </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-S.C. </LOCATION>, said alcohol and drug use by transportation workers can not be ignored. He said railroad accidents linked to drug or alcohol occurred once every 12 -LCB- days last year. `` Call it intimidation. Call it whatever you will,'' <PERSON> Hollings </PERSON> said. `` But the fact is that random testing is the only method we have to reasonably ensure that transportation employees will not use drugs on the job.'' Rep. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Luken </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, sponsor of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> drug bill, said the bill requiring random testing of railroad workers has bipartisan support. He accused <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> of wanting anti-drug measures left to the `` whims of the transportation secretary.'' <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> B </PERSON>. Stone of the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said errors in testing could result in the loss of 200 pilots. <PERSON> Stone </PERSON> said no crash of a scheduled airliner has been linked to alcohol abuse. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> blamed a January 1988 <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> crash on cocaine use by the pilot, but <PERSON> Stone </PERSON> said other possible causes of that crash were not adequately investigated. <PERSON> Stone </PERSON> said random testing would cost the industry millions of dollars but `` would not produce much.'' <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connell </PERSON>, lawyer for a national association of owner-operated trucks, said `` millions of innocent drivers will be victimized'' by random tests. O ` <PERSON> Connell </PERSON> introduced <PERSON> Sandy </PERSON> <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Anderson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, who owns and drives a single truck with her husband, as an example of a driver who would have to give random urine samples. Mrs. <PERSON> Craig </PERSON>, interviewed after the hearing, said she opposes roadside random testing because it would delay her trips, `` and I think the procedure proposed is humiliating.''

<TEXT>
 Researchers at <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Atomic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> say they were unable to reproduce cold fusion, something two <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION> scientists earlier this year claimed to have achieved. After spending $ 480,000 over three months trying to repeat the experiment, the scientists at the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atomic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Harwell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> near <LOCATION> Oxford </LOCATION> said Thursday they failed `` Not every mad idea works out,'' saidteam leader <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, who nonetheless spoke admiringly of the previous work by the two scientists. But one of the two, <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fleischmann </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Southampton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, stood by his findings. He told <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s domestic news agency, `` We can not find any flaw in our technique, and we are very happy with the work we have done so far.'' <PERSON> Fleischmann </PERSON> and <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Pons </PERSON>, of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Utah </ORGANIZATION>, said on March 23 they had generated energy with palladium and platinum electrodes dipped in a beaker of heavy water at room temperature. Heavy water is made of oxygen and deuterium, a form of hydrogen with a neutron in the nucleus. In fusion, tremendous amounts of energy are released when the nucleus, or core, of one hydrogen atom fuses with the nucleus of another hydrogen atom. In contrast, nuclear power plants generate energy from fission, which is the splitting of atoms. Nuclear fusion is the energy source of the sun, and thousands of researchers have been trying to achieve it for 20 years. Reporting on his team's results, <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said it was unable to detect a single neutron, the key sign indicating a fusion process is occurring. It also found no heat produced. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>: `` We've used three different types of heat-flow instrument, we've used all sorts of different types of neutron counters, we've used them upside down, inside out, changed the solution. We've checked, we've calibrated: everything.'' `` We're very disappointed. This would have been a very significant discovery,'' he said.

 <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> economists are forecasting a significant rise this summer in broiler production. Over all of 1989, broiler output is expected to rise 5 percent from last year, when production was up 4 percent from 1987. However, the department's <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said broiler production in the first quarter of this year rose only 3 percent, compared with a 7 percent gain during January, February and March of 1988. Thus, the agency said in the June issue of Agricultural Outlook magazine, broiler output in the second quarter probably will be up 4 percent from a year earlier, while third-quarter production may gain 7 percent. Analysts said the production increase is being fed by `` high prices and lower feed costs'' and that net returns to broiler producers have been on the plus side for a year. Broiler wholesale prices based on a composite city market averaged almost 64 cents per pound in April, well above the 49 cents of a year earlier, the report said. The average in the first three months was 59 cents. `` With higher summer demand for broilers and tighter second-half beef supplies, wholesale prices may average 68 to 70 cents for the second quarter and 65 to 71 cents for the third,'' the report said.

 <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s new two-seat convertible is being billed as a sports car for the masses. The Japanese automaker introduced the car Thursday, saying its base price of $ 13,800 leaves it alone in a segment of the market that had been populated by the Pontiac Fiero and other cars not so long ago. <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION> is counting on consumers to make the distinction between a sports car, which its new Miata MX-5 is, and a `` sporty'' car, like the RX-7 or <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION>'s 300ZX or 200SX. `` It's our belief that many of those sporty-car buyers would like a sports car,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> McCabe </PERSON>, vice president for sales of <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` It's a sports car for the masses.'' Prices for `` sporty'' cars have been pushed into the $ 20,000 range because of currency exchange rates and the addition of an array of electronic gadgetry, leaving a gap in the market at the lower end. Options on the Miata could push it into the $ 16,000 range, officials said. <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION> began full-scale development of a two-seat car without a lot of the electronic additions on the more-expensive models in 1986. Development costs were held to a modest $ 100 million because it shares some features with the Mazda 323. <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION> plans limited production of the car. The company expects to sell about 20,000 during the last half of this year and twice that many during 1990. The assembly plant in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> has a 60,000-car-a-year capacity. For now, the car is being marketed only in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, with distribution in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> possible next year, officials said. The rear-wheel-drive car carries a 116-horsepower, four-cylinder, 1.6-liter engine. And that could pose a problem with insurance companies, officials said. `` It's true that insurance has really impacted the sports car category in the last couple of years,'' <PERSON> McCabe </PERSON> said at a news conference. `` We do n't expect the insurance companies will view the Miata in a negative light.''

 The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> will gather for their triennial constitutional convention just down the street from <LOCATION> Disneyland </LOCATION> next week, but the atmosphere inside the convention center may rife with hard feelings. Underneath the speeches, political wrangling and hoopla in <LOCATION> Anaheim </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, will be rumblings of dissent. Union President <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> <PERSON> Bieber </PERSON>, the Administration Caucus he runs and the union's increasingly cooperative attitude toward management have been sharply criticized by the New Directions movement, spearheaded by <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON> of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>. While the two are seeking seats as regional directors, they may be dark-horse candidates. In local delegate elections, New Directions candidates in <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON>'s and <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON>'s regions came up short. Nevertheless, <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON>, who goes into the convention as director of one of the <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION>'s largest regions in a position he won through a federally supervised election last year, has said the New Directions movement has widespread support, and that could show up in reports from the convention's credentials and resolutions committees. The credentials committee certifies the seating of delegates. It's possible that challenges could by mounted by New Directions forces, which have contended that some delegate elections were won by <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caucus </ORGANIZATION> supporters through questionable, and in some cases illegal, means. <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON> has asked the union's hierarchy to review some of the elections and has hinted that lawsuits could be filed over local delegate elections. After all, <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON> has said in the past, that's how he was elected director of <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Region </ORGANIZATION> 5 in the first place New Directions supporters also may show up around the middle of the week-long convention if a resolution surfaces that would seek delegate endorsement of more <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> representation on automakers' boards of directors <PERSON> Bieber </PERSON> sits on the board of <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a position granted during the early 1980s when the <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> signed concession contracts with the nation's No. 3 automaker. The <ORGANIZATION> Detroit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> reported Thursday that the resolution also would support increased union cooperation with management. Both of the issues are at the core of New Directions' arguments with <PERSON> Bieber </PERSON> and the Administration Caucus. Despite potential challenges, <PERSON> Bieber </PERSON> is virtually assured of election to a third, three-year term at the head of the huge union, which during his administration has looked outside the auto industry for members. Joining the traditional delegates from auto factory shop floors will be representatives of <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> state workers, clerical workers from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> colleges and jai alai players.

One trader said participants felt a `` modicum of comfort'' after the data showed a 0.6-percent increase in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s retail price index for May, compared with a 1.8-percent rise in April.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Du </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> has developed a new version of its familiar Teflon frypan coating for computers, fiber optics and other high technology uses. Teflon AF is a descendent of the non-stick substance that was discovered 51 years ago, specialty business director <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON> said Thursday. The AF stands for amorphous fluoropolymers, the chemical compound that is credited with making the new product an improvement over the stuff that is best known for keeping food from sticking to pots and pans. `` This product is a quantum leap forward in polymer technology. It is designed specifically for advanced, high technology applications and can be tailored for many high performance uses,'' said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Darling </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Du </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pont </ORGANIZATION> venture manager for <ORGANIZATION> Teflon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AF </ORGANIZATION>. With performance characteristics that far exceed ordinary <PERSON> Teflon </PERSON>, the new product is expected to meet design engineers' material needs in a variety of high technology areas, including high-speed computer circuitry, the company said in a statement. <PERSON> Du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> has targeted several markets for the new product, including aerospace, automotive, aircraft, biomedical, specialized chemical handling and possible petroleum exploration, <PERSON> Darling </PERSON> said. `` We view this as a complimentary addition to the Teflon product line. It's not likely it will compete with markets Teflon now serves. It will open up new markets for this particular type of Teflon and it tends to be in areas of fairly high technology,'' <PERSON> Darling </PERSON> said. He said the new Teflon is soluble, unlike the original, solid version. It has electrical properties that are expected to be ideal for high-speed advanced generation computers and other high technology needs of the 21st century. The company said the new product can also function in severe temperatures and can be used in such chemical applications as semiconductor processing. Darling said more uses for the new product are sure to be discovered over the years. `` I do expect this will have a long and healthy life. It has performance features new to the Teflon current family and over the long term we will continue to find uses for it as they have'' for the older version, <PERSON> Darling </PERSON> said. `` Du Pont technology can help customize and tailor the material to meet specific, and as yet unknown, needs.'' The company has built a Teflon AF plant in <LOCATION> Fayetteville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, which is expected to begin operations at the end of July or in early August, <PERSON> Darling </PERSON> said. The original Teflon was discovered accidentally April 6, 1938, by a young chemist named <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Plunkett </PERSON>. In addition to cookware, it coats chemical tanks, jogging suits and lightbulbs. Its greatest commercial use is in wire coating, followed by gaskets and shaft seals and pipe and tank coatings.

<DATELINE>BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Goldome today rescinded its policy of requiring laid-off workers to sign an agreement promising not to talk to the media about losing their jobs in order to receive full severance pay. The policy had embittered current and former employees who felt the company was threatening laid-off workers. <ORGANIZATION> Goldome </ORGANIZATION> Chief Executive Officer <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> said, `` Our intention, to help assure the confidentiality of employee, customer and corporate information ... has been submerged by misperceptions of the agreement. This makes its continued use counterproductive.'' As many as 150 people had been terminated in recent weeks and asked to sign the `` Release and Confidentiality Agreement,'' which prevented them from suing Goldome or discussing their layoff with anyone except `` counsel, personal tax adviser, immediate family or as required by law.'' If laid-off employees refused to sign, their severance benefits would have been cut to two weeks pay from a maximum of six. Sources within the company said management thought news of <ORGANIZATION> Goldome </ORGANIZATION>'s layoffs could cause customers to withdraw money from the bank. Although many companies require new employees to sign confidentiality agreements, it is highly unusual for a company to require terminated employees to sign such an agreement as a condition of receiving severance pay. `` It's not illegal, but I would n't consider it morally right,'' said an analyst with <PERSON> Mercer </PERSON>, <PERSON> Meidinger </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON>, a leading human resources consulting firm in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Nearly all of <ORGANIZATION> Goldome </ORGANIZATION>'s laid-off workers signed the agreement, sources said. The confidentiality requirement came after the company reduced its severance policy May 1. Companies are not required by law to provide any severance pay, but most offer it as part of a benefits package to attract qualified employees and as a humanitarian gesture. <ORGANIZATION> Goldome </ORGANIZATION>, which lost $ 119 million last year, is in the middle of a restructuring effort.

 CHICAG0 -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON>'s efforts to appease winners in its botched `` Ready to Roll'' game are n't winning over everybody. `` I do n't mean to sound greedy, but the settlement offer is kind of skimpy and it's a far cry from what was being offered,'' says <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernstein </PERSON>, who matched game pieces for a $ 17,000 van. <PERSON> Bernstein </PERSON> was one of an estimated several hundred people who matched game pieces for a <ORGANIZATION> Dodge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Caravan </ORGANIZATION> in a contest designed to have only one van winner. <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON> on Thursday offered those winners $ 250 and a special drawing for four vans. `` I'm not really too pleased,'' he said. `` You're talking $ 17,000 versus $ 250. I suspect lots of people will want to go ahead with the lawsuits.'' At least three class-action lawsuits have been filed against the company. The suburban Chicago-based company, known formally as <ORGANIZATION> Kraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cos. </ORGANIZATION>, also offered to make up for the mistake by quadrupling the number of prizes and giving away cash to all winners. <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON> told the Sun-Times the mistake was made by the unidentified companies that prepared the game, not <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON>. `` There was a mistake, obviously, but it was clearly unintentional,'' said <PERSON> Mitch </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinick </PERSON>, president of Refrigerated Products for <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON> <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION>. `` Because our customers are so good-natured and good-humored, we're trying to do right by them.'' The promotion was run only in the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> metropolitan areas. The contest required consumers to match left halves of a pictured van contained in specially marked packages of <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON> Singles cheese with right halves appearing in coupons in Sunday newspaper advertisements. <PERSON> Bernstein </PERSON> was n't the only one balking at the deal. `` I look at it this way,'' said <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> <PERSON> LaMont </PERSON>, who also had matched game pieces for a van. `` If they had cheese on sale for $ 1.39 and I offered to buy it for 14 cents, do you think they'd let me have it?'' The <LOCATION> Skokie </LOCATION> resident joined one of the class-action lawsuits. `` We have five secretaries just taking the calls,'' said attorney <PERSON> Burton </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinstein </PERSON>, who filed a lawsuit. He said his firm is representing at least 300 people. <PERSON> Diana </PERSON> <PERSON> Redmond </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Rockford </LOCATION> resident who has n't decided whether to join the lawsuit, said a drawing that included everyone who matched game pieces for the van would n't be fair. `` I'm one of the people who followed instructions specifically and put the entry in the mail on Monday. I feel I should have a little better chance. `` Instead,'' she said, `` they're giving a lot of Johnny-come-latelies ... the people who started scrounging through their garbage after they read about this, the same chance as me to win.'' In separate negotiations with <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> officials, <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON> entered into voluntary compliance agreements that, in effect, free the company from charges of violating consumer laws in its `` Ready to Roll'' game. Under the agreements, <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON> is voluntarily offering the extra contest payments and holding the alternative drawing. Investigators `` have found no ground to suggest that there was any effort to deceive or otherwise violate any consumer protection law,'' said <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> Attorney General <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartigan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON> said virtually every package of cheese contained a game piece that matched the pieces found in Sunday newspaper inserts. After hundreds of people called Sunday night to claim they'd won the grand prize, <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON> declared the contest null and void. The company also pulled packages of the cheese slices from grocery store shelves. <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Caruso </PERSON> said the company's attorneys believe it's not liable for the prizes because `` of the nature of the mistake. It was appropriately revoked.'' In addition to the van, <PERSON> Kraft </PERSON> had planned to award 100 bicycles, 500 skateboards and 8,000 packages of cheese. The company said in addition to the $ 250 cash prizes for those who matched game pieces for the van, it would award $ 50 to bicycle winners, $ 25 to skateboard winners and $ 5 to cheese winners. The drawing for the vans was set for July 14. Only one winner will be allowed per household. The deadline for submitting winning entries is midnight Friday.

 <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s credit ratings are at risk due to its political upheaval, and the nation may face increased difficulty raising money in world financial markets for economic development projects, experts say. <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> recently put its ratings of Chinese bonds on review for a possible downgrade. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s credit-rating agencies also said they are re-examining their assessment of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s debt Should the credit-rating companies lower their ratings, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> may have to pay a higher interest rate on future bond issues. The price of existing Chinese bonds has plunged on European markets in reaction to the government's crackdown on pro-democracy demonstrators. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has more than $ 1 billion worth of bonds in circulation on the Euromarkets. In addition, the turmoil has delayed a new $ 100 million bond offering in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> by one of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s provincial development corporations, stalled a $ 120 billion Japanese bank loan to a Chinese petrochemical company, and held up a $ 60 billion agricultural loan from the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. Analysts say it's too soon to say what lasting impact the upheaval may have on <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s ability to borrow overseas from commerical and governmental sources. But many believe damage has been done, no matter what the outcome of the nation's power struggle. `` It's already going to be marginally more expensive -LRB- for <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> to borrow -RRB-, but the question is, how much higher,'' said <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Harbaugh </PERSON>, an analyst for the <ORGANIZATION> WEFA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, a financial forecasting firm. <PERSON> Harbaugh </PERSON> said he believes <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> increasingly will rely on its $ 19 billion in foreign reserves this year for funding instead of foreign debt. These reserves consist of convertible currencies, such as dollars, pounds and yen, held by the Chinese central bank. <ORGANIZATION> WEFA </ORGANIZATION> recently released a grim forecast for <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s economy for the rest of the year. It said production of goods has faltered, and the confidence of foreigners who invest in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has been shaken. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s reliance on foreign finance has grown as its free-market economic system has expanded. The nation has about $ 40 billion in outside credit from all sources, according to <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> and WEFA. Of that, about $ 12 billion is government debt, either in direct loans from other nations or from governmental bodies such as the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Taran </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> analyst. The rest, about $ 28 billion, is commercial debt, he said. This includes about $ 6 billion in bonds, with the remainder in bank loans and credits from foreign companies that sell goods to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> on credit. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has floated most of its bonds on Asian exchanges. No bonds have been sold in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> has given the Chinese bonds it rates a rank of A-3, which it considers a `` middle-high'' rating on its scale of Aaa to C. When <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION>'s originally rated the bonds, `` we made some judgements about the possible range of political instability that might take place in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Levey </PERSON>, another <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION>'s analyst Under the re-evaluation, he said, the company will look again at all the factors that it took into account for the original rating to see what has changed. Among these factors is <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s economy and whether the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> government has lost some element of its long-term support among the population, he said. But undertaking the re-evaluation wo n't be easy, he said. `` Lots of things we would like to know are shrouded in secrecy and obscurity,'' he said. Another bond-rating service, <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Poors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, has n't formally rated <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s debt But it said in a statement last week that despite the recent turmoil, it considers <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s ability to meet debt obligations on time as `` satisfactory but vulnerable to adverse developments.'' `` <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s strong export growth, balanced current account, modest external debt burden and large international reserves continue to provide ample ability to service foreign debt,'' <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; P said. No matter what the outcome of the review of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s debt, an executive at a major Wall Street investment house said her company has n't put much faith in the ratings. `` We think the ratings do not take sufficient account of the political risk in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, and we think events bore us out,'' she said, speaking on condition of anonymity. <PERSON> Harbaugh </PERSON>, the WEFA analyst, also advised traders in Chinese bonds to be cautious. `` I think they should certainly be skeptical, but I think probably things will work out,'' he said.

 Troubled <ORGANIZATION> Coleco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> has agreed to sell most of its assets to <ORGANIZATION> Hasbro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> for $ 85 million in cash, a deal analysts said means the demise of the toymaker that introduced the hottest-selling toy in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> history, the Cabbage Patch doll. `` Coleco always stood for innovation and the ability to take risks,'' said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Valentine </PERSON>, a toy analyst with <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York-based </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Poor </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> `` The industry is poorer because of their demise.'' Under the agreement announced Thursday, Avon-based <ORGANIZATION> Coleco </ORGANIZATION>, now operating under <ORGANIZATION> Bankruptcy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> protection, also will receive warrants to purchase 1 million shares of <ORGANIZATION> Hasbro </ORGANIZATION> stock. <LOCATION> Pawtucket </LOCATION>, R.I.-based <ORGANIZATION> Hasbro </ORGANIZATION>, the largest <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> toymaker, will receive <ORGANIZATION> Coleco </ORGANIZATION>'s product line, which includes the Scrabble and Parcheesi board games as well as the Cabbage Patch dolls, <ORGANIZATION> Coleco </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> <PERSON> Handel </PERSON> said. In addition to buying inventory and the equipment to make the products, <ORGANIZATION> Hasbro </ORGANIZATION> will buy certain accounts receivable, <PERSON> Handel </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Coleco </ORGANIZATION> will retain all of its cash assets and certain real estate that it will convert to cash, <PERSON> Handel </PERSON> said. At the completion of the transaction, <ORGANIZATION> Coleco </ORGANIZATION> will have as much as $ 150 million in cash _ the $ 85 million from <ORGANIZATION> Hasbro </ORGANIZATION> and about $ 65 million <ORGANIZATION> Coleco </ORGANIZATION> had in the banks in mid-March, <PERSON> Handel </PERSON> said. The cash will be used to pay off the company's debt, he said. When <ORGANIZATION> Coleco </ORGANIZATION> filed for bankruptcy protection a year ago, it listed debt of $ 540.3 million. The agreement still must be approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Bankruptcy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Handel </PERSON> said. The deal is also subject to the approval of <ORGANIZATION> Original </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appalachian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Artworks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, creator of Cabbage Patch Kids, and <ORGANIZATION> Coleco </ORGANIZATION> directors. If the deal is approved, most of <ORGANIZATION> Coleco </ORGANIZATION>'s remaining 250 employees are expected to be laid off, although some may be hired by <ORGANIZATION> Hasbro </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Handel </PERSON> said. `` Coleco was pretty much the victim of its own success,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Leibowitz </PERSON>, senior vice president of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York-based </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> `` Cabbage Patch in 1985 was the largest single selling toy of all time, selling $ 600 million-plus at wholesale.'' The success of the homely Cabbage Patch dolls forced <ORGANIZATION> Coleco </ORGANIZATION> to expand, borrowing money to do so, he said. When Cabbage Patch Kids sales tumbled and new products _ including the <LOCATION> Adam </LOCATION> home computer and toys based on Rambo movies _ did not sell, the company could not pay off the new debts, he said. <PERSON> Valentine </PERSON> said <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenberg </PERSON>, the former <ORGANIZATION> Coleco </ORGANIZATION> chairman, managed the company too aggressively without focusing on cost controls. `` They managed their company for a sales revival that never came,'' <PERSON> Valentine </PERSON> said. But, he added, it was <PERSON> Greenberg </PERSON> who transformed <ORGANIZATION> Coleco </ORGANIZATION> into a major company. <PERSON> Greenberg </PERSON>'s Russian immigrant father, <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenberg </PERSON>, founded the company as the <ORGANIZATION> Connecticut </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION> in 1932, selling leather and shoe heels and soles. The company expanded into toys in 1954. <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenberg </PERSON> joined <ORGANIZATION> Coleco </ORGANIZATION> full time in 1966. He bought the license to the Cabbage Patch Kids in 1982 after several major toy companies turned down the dolls, which were designed with their own set of adoption papers. For growing <ORGANIZATION> Hasbro </ORGANIZATION>, which in the last decade has bought such big-name toymakers as <ORGANIZATION> Milton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bradley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and introduced a steady stream of new products, the deal means yet another line of toys. <ORGANIZATION> Hasbro </ORGANIZATION>, which makes GI <PERSON> Joe </PERSON>, Mr. Potato Head, My Little Pony and the Transformers, had sales of $ 1.34 billion last year, up from just $ 104.3 million in 1980. `` Under Hasbro, I think Cabbage Patch will grow substantially over the next few years,'' <PERSON> Valentine </PERSON> said. `` Even <PERSON> Barbie </PERSON> has her ups and downs. The Cabbage Patch Kids wo n't wilt forever.''

<HEAD>Gallo Pulls High-Alcohol Wines From San Francisco's Seedy Tenderloin
District</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: also on general news wires.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The E. & amp; <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallo </PERSON> <PERSON> Winery </PERSON>, responding to activists' demands, says it will pull two brands of high-alcohol wine from store shelves in the city's seedy <LOCATION> Tenderloin </LOCATION> neighborhood in a six-month experiment. The Modesto-based Gallo, the world's largest winery, said if the removal of the offending wines succeeds in reducing alcoholism in the area, the company will pull its Thunderbird and Night Train Express brands in other neighborhoods. The company has never removed a product from the shelves before, said <PERSON> Gallo </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Solomon </PERSON>. The action came Wednesday after Tenderloin area distributor Gallo-Bay Cities, a Gallo-owned business, met with a group called Safe and Sober Streets, which recently kicked off a public protest of high-alcohol brands in their district. <ORGANIZATION> Canandaigua </ORGANIZATION>'s Wild Irish <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> was also singled out, as well as the two Gallo brands. The protesters said they could n't walk the streets of the Tenderloin without tripping over or being menaced by apparent alcoholics. <PERSON> Gallo </PERSON>, a privately held company, has $ 1 billion in annual sales and 28 percent of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wine market. The Sober Streets group went from store to store to ask proprietors to take the cheap wines off their shelves. One grocer said he resumed selling the wine after he lost $ 850 in sales in a single day. <PERSON> Solomon </PERSON> characterized the action as an experiment by the <PERSON> Gallo </PERSON> organization to test the premise that alcoholics deprived of their cheap wine will turn to other types of alcohol. `` We believe, and the evidence tends to support, that if alcoholics are deprived of one source, be it beer, wine or cheap distilled spirits, they will find another, regardless of difficulty or cost,'' he said. `` If what we have done in this neighborhood improves the alcoholism problem in this area, we'll do the same thing in other neighborhoods,'' he said. <PERSON> Solomon </PERSON> refused to say whether he meant <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> or the entire country. The high-alcohol wines are typically made from the cheapest vinous ingredients with a hint of grape flavor, then mixed with grape brandy to bring the mixture to about 18 percent alcohol by volume. Regular table wine is about 12 percent. The high-alcohol wines sell for about 90 cents to $ 1.25 a bottle, or fifth of a gallon.

<HEAD>Crop Futures Gain On Weather Outlook</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Grain and soybean futures were slightly higher in early trading today on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>, reflecting growing confidence among traders that the Midwestern weather is due for a change. Forecasters continued to predict hot, dry conditions in the Corn Belt by late next week, and some traders were even beginning to take a bullish view of the dampness that has prevailed in the region this week. `` Crop development is being impeded by this cold, wet weather,'' said <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Zusel </PERSON>, manager of <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> floor operations for <ORGANIZATION> Balfour </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maclaine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. Temperatures dropped so low Thursday that some frost damage to corn was reported in northern <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and southern <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, but crop losses were not extensive. The advancing winter wheat harvest kept a lid on early gains in the wheat market. In early trading, wheat was -RCB- cent to 2 cents higher with the contract for delivery in July at $ 3.95 -RCB- a bushel; corn was 1 -LCB- cents to 2 -LCB- cents higher with July at $ 2.61 -RCB- a bushel; oats were 1 \ cents to 1 -LCB- cents higher wiith July at $ 1.67 -RCB- a bushel; soybeans were 3 -LCB- cents to 6 cents higher with July at $ 7.37 -LCB- a bushel Livestock and meat futures were mostly higher in early trading on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Live cattle were .10 cent to .40 cent higher with June at 71.82 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .20 cent lower to .18 ent higher with August at 81.15 cents a pound; live hogs were .18 cent to .50 cent higher with June at 48.15 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .35 cent to .53 cent higher with July at 34.65 cents a pound. Livestock and meat futures settled higher on Thursday.

<HEAD>Records Indicate Rockwell Workers Overexposed To Radiation</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: also on general news wires.</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Dozens of workers at two <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> facilities in <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> were exposed to excessive levels of radiation in the 1960s, federal documents show. No overexposures were shown for subsequent years. The documents, released Thursday by the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> under the Freedom of Information Act, exclude two overexposure incidents <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION> officials have confirmed took place in the 1970s and'80s. Also omitted from the records were the settlements <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION> paid recently in at least three workers compensation cases involving cancer deaths allegedly caused by radiation exposure. <PERSON> Rockwell </PERSON> did n't admit liability when it paid the settlements in 1987-88. The released documents are called unusual occurrence reports. The Energy Department requires contractors such as <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION> to file such reports after safety or equipment problems. `` We fully recognize we have a very serious responsibility to the public, and that's why we monitor our activities so closely,'' said <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Coulter </PERSON>, spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Rocketdyne </ORGANIZATION> division. `` That's why when there is a deviance, we record it and make sure it does n't happen again Most of the unusual occurrence reports described minor equipment malfunctions that apparently did n't involve worker or environmental safety. The two facilities, one in the <LOCATION> Canoga </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> area and the other the company's <ORGANIZATION> Santa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Susana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Field </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> in the hills bordering <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ventura </LOCATION> counties, have worked for more than 30 years for the energy and weapons programs of the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and its predecessor, the <ORGANIZATION> Atomic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. Workers during several episodes between 1960 and 1967 were exposed to higher-than-acceptable limits of rems per year at the two plants, according to the documents. Allowable limits, measured by film badges worn by workers, are three rems per calendar quarter or five rems per year. A report, for example, on a 1961 incident shows that an employee was assigned to work in a nuclear reactor room although his quarterly exposure was already near the 3 rem limit, prompting his dose to rise to 3.455 rem. Five rems is equivalent to between 100 to 200 chest X-rays or about 50 times the natural background radiation from the sun, rocks and soil. Experts say five rems is n't considered a high radiation dose, but warned a worker exposed to that level for 30 years has up to three extra chances in 100 of dying of cancer.

 Most employers should be required to provide health insurance, according to polls of doctors and the public, but a manufacturing group is worried about the cost. `` The cost of health care for American business has tripled over the past eight years,'' said <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION>. `` We have n't seen parallel improvements in quality.'' Mandated coverage, she said, would only worsen an `` enormous'' financial drain on revenues that could otherwise go for capital improvements, worker training and industrial technology. A poll, published in today's issue of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>, said that 57 percent of the public and 34 percent of doctors questioned believed all employers should be required to provide health-insurance coverage. An additional 22 percent of the public and 36 percent of the physicians surveyed believed that coverage should be required in most cases, but that small businesses and part-time employees should be exempt. Only 19 percent of the public and 27 percent of the physicians said the government should not mandate coverage; 3 percent in both surveys were undecided, the report said. The Gallup Organization conducted the polls for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, whose <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Delegates </ORGANIZATION> meets here for its annual policy meeting next week. The polls did not specify whether employers would pay the full cost. More than 35 million Americans lack health insurance, according to some estimates, and <ORGANIZATION> AMA </ORGANIZATION> trustees in March said the government should require that all employers gradually provide health insurance for full-time employees. A bill sponsored by Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass. to mandate coverage for employees who work more than 17 -LCB- hours a week and their dependents is before a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committee. The bill applies to all businesses, but contains a clause under which small companies could get government subsidies. Gallup questioned 1,500 randomly selected <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> adults via telephone during late January and early February, with a sampling error estimated at 2.5 percentage points. For the doctors' poll, Gallup queried 1,004 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> physicians from the <ORGANIZATION> AMA </ORGANIZATION>'s list in late January and early February. The margin of error is calculated at 3.5 percentage points. American Medical News is the weekly newspaper of the Chicago-based <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>.

 The stock market was mixed late this morning and the pace of activity eased after a powerful trading surge in the early going. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 4.29 to 2,479.29 by noon on Wall Street. Declining issues outpaced advances on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, with 656 down, 570 up and 571 unchanged. The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> composite index of all its listed common stocks was up 0.07 to 179.04. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 155.33 million shares at midday, up from 84.31 million shares at the same point in the previous session. Stock trading got off to a brisk start before settling down; more than 107 million shares changed hands in the first half hour of trading. Investment analysts attributed the unusually heavy trading volume on Wall Street to manuevers associated with the expiration of stock-index futures, index options and options on individual stocks. This occurence commonly called the `` triple witching hour'' takes place once a quarter. Reports on inflation and the housing industry had little impact on stocks. The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the Consumer Price Index rose a sharp 0.6 percent in May, pushed up by strong increases in food and gasoline costs.

 <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> submitted a revised bid for <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> today that includes an additional $ 200 million in equity while oil billionaire <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said he has revised his offer for the carrier for the last time. <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>'s machinists' union also met today's deadline for revised offers, the union's president said, but previous bidder MEI Diversified of <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> said it would not make a new offer. <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> parent <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> had set today as a deadline for revised offers after rejecting all offers in the first round of bidding. A group led by <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> investor <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Checchi </PERSON> is the only other suitor known to have met the initial deadline. <PERSON> Checchi </PERSON> said today he would not comment on whether the group would submit a new offer. <ORGANIZATION> KLM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dutch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> is an equity partner in the <PERSON> Checchi </PERSON> group. Northwest stock rose 12 -LCB- cents to $ 107.62 -LCB- a share today in mid-morning trading on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Analysts have said the winning bid could be as high as $ 120 a share, but the company repeatedly has said it may not sell the airline. <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Plaskett </PERSON> said his revised bid for the nation's fourth-largest airline includes $ 200 million in equity from <ORGANIZATION> Corporate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION>, an investment fund organized by <ORGANIZATION> Lazard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Freres </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and managed by <PERSON> Lester </PERSON> <PERSON> Pollack </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wambold </PERSON>.

No other details were disclosed, but <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Pamela </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanlon </PERSON> said the bid still includes bank financing and subordinated debt placed with private institutions. The earlier <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> bid included $ 2.7 billion in bank financing. `` This new equity has allowed us to make a proposal that is vigorously competitive and attractive to <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION>'s shareholders, employees and others who have a strong stake in <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>'s long-term future,'' <PERSON> Plaskett </PERSON> said <PERSON> Plaskett </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> met with <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>'s financial adviser, before revising its proposal. He said he believes the new offer `` addresses the concerns'' <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> had about the original <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> bid. <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> appointed a special committee to review the offers. A spokesman for <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, who opened the bidding for <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> on March 28 with an offer of $ 2.7 billion, or $ 90 a share, said the oil mogul has submitted a `` new and very full'' offer. `` It's one which he and his advisers believe provides the greatest value to shareholders while at the same time ensuring that the company is not overly leveraged,'' the spokesman said. `` This is Mr. <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>' final bid for the company.'' <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> Cook </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lodge </ORGANIZATION> 143, said the union has submitted a revised bid, but he did not disclose details.

MEI Diversified, led by <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> banker <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Pohlad </PERSON>, issued a statement saying it would not revise its offer.

The four-member committee of the <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> board announced June 5 that it had rejected all the first-round bids and asked for `` enhanced'' revisions. It has not identified bids or bidders, but it said it would favor a high price, a low level of debt and an ability to complete a deal quickly. Analysts expect the special committee to make a decision on the revised bids next week. The company asked bidders to keep their offers open through June 30.

 Investigators have found severe cracks in the engines of grounded <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737-400s operated by British carriers, the <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> reported today. The <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION>, which ordered the aircraft grounded last week, and the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> said they could not confirm or deny the report. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Gamble </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commercial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airplanes </ORGANIZATION>, said the Seattle-based company also could not confirm or deny the report. `` We know of some cracking found in suspect engines sent to <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> for repair, but we ca n't confirm it,'' he said today. The Times said the cracks were more serious than the breaking of fan blades in two engines, which occurred during two British flights last week. It said the new cracks have been found on previously untested engines. `` The damage is so fundamental that any hope of getting the aircraft flying in time for the holiday peak has been dashed,'' said the report by the newspaper's air correspondent, <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON>. The newspaper said detailed reports on the cracks have been sent to the French manufacturer, <ORGANIZATION> SNECMA </ORGANIZATION>, which makes the engines in conjunction with <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> under the joint name <ORGANIZATION> CFM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>. On Monday, the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> grounded the 12 British-operated <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737-400 aircraft powered by CFM56-3C engines after the two incidents on British planes last week. In the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commercial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airplanes </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> CFM </ORGANIZATION> recommended Tuesday that 737-400s with the -3 C engines, and some other engines that had been operated at high thrust levels, be grounded for engine modifications The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> followed with its own grounding order Wednesday. The five <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> planes with affected engines, all operated by <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION>, were back in service Thursday, <PERSON> Gamble </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> exchanged the planes' engines for ones with lesser maximum thrust, he said. The other 28 affected 737-400s are all operated by airlines outside the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. In the British incidents, a <LOCATION> Dan-Air </LOCATION> 737-400 returned to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Gatwick </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> and a <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Midlands </LOCATION> 737-400 made an emergency landing at <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Midlands </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> after engine vibrations Both airlines said the turbofan blades had been damaged. In January, a <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Midlands </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737-400 crashed near <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Midlands </LOCATION> airport, killing 47 people after the pilot reported one engine failed in flight. The investigation, not yet complete, has found that the pilot shut down the good engine before trying to land.

 Consumer prices rose a sharp 0.6 percent in May, pushed up by strong increases in food and gasoline costs, the government said today. The rise in the Consumer Price Index, the government's primary gauge of inflation at the retail level, followed an even stronger 0.7 percent April increase that was the largest jump in more than two years, the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> called the price increase `` disappointing'' but said administration officials `` continue to believe that inflation will remain low and under control.'' During the first five months of the year, consumer prices rose at an annual rate of 6.7 percent, a significantly faster pace than the 4.4 percent price increases registered in 1987 and 1988. Inflation at the wholesale level has been even stronger, rising at an annual rate of 9.4 percent so far this year. `` Reports of inflation's demise have been grossly exaggerated,'' said economist <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Berson </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mortgage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. `` The core rate does n't appear to have subsided and, with the economy running close to full employment, will edge up as the year the goes on.'' Despite the persistently strong price increases, some other analysts believe inflation now may begin to level off and that it could start to drop again late this year. `` It's not a good report, but we can look forward to a plateauing of this increase,'' said <PERSON> Stacy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kottman </PERSON>, research director at the <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forecasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` In the last half of 1989, the -LRB- inflation -RRB- range will come down.'' Today's report will be closely scrutinized by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, which last week slightly eased its grip on the money supply in the belief that the slowing economy will help to tame inflation. Analysts believe the central bank will wait for further evidence that inflation is under control before it eases any more. In May, the overall inflation rate was heavily influenced by a 1.6 percent increase in energy costs. These costs had shot up 5.1 percent in April, when there was an all-time record increase in gasoline prices of 11.4 percent. Last month's increase in gasoline costs was a still-strong 3.9 percent, which accounted for about one-fourth of the overall increase in the CPI for May. Food and beverage prices, meanwhile, increased 0.6 percent last month after rising 0.5 percent in April. The May increase included a sharp 3.2 percent jump in prices for fruits and vegetables. Beef prices rose 0.5 percent and poultry prices 3.2 percent. Excluding the volatile food and energy categories, other consumer prices rose 0.5 percent in May, up from a 0.2 percent increase in April. Many analysts closely watch these figures and believe they represent the important `` core'' level of inflationary pressures in the economy. In a separate report, the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Americans' average weekly earnings, after adjusting for inflation, fell 1.3 percent in May after rising 0.5 percent a month earlier Average weekly earnings in May, before adjusting for inflation, were $ 331.20, up 3.4 percent from a year earlier. Taking the 5.4 percent inflation rate for urban workers into account over the 12-month period, real weekly earnings were down 1.9 percent. The various May price changes left the overall Consumer Price Index at 123.8 percent of its 1982-84 base. This means that a hypothetical selection of goods costing $ 100 during the base period would have cost $ 123.80 last month, 70 cents more than in April. The 0.6 percent increase in prices last month was slightly higher than most analysts had expected. The consensus projection had been 0.5 percent. The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> offered these other details of price changes in May:

 _ Apparel prices increased 0.8 percent after rising 0.3 percent in April Smaller-than-usual seasonal price declines for women's and girls' clothing were largely responsible for the seasonally adjusted increase. _ Entertainment costs rose 0.1 percent in May after jumping 0.6 percent in April Admission charges for movies, theaters, concerts and sporting events were down. _ Medical care prices rose 0.7 percent and advanced 7.3 percent over the past 12 months Drugs and medical supply costs rose 1.1 percent in May. _ Transportation costs rose 1 percent in May after shooting up 2.1 percent in April, with both months' figures boosted by the sharp gasoline price increases Before it moved last week to ease credit, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> since March 1988 had been pushing interest rates upward in an attempt to curb inflation by restraining economic growth. Signs that the economy is in fact slowing have proliferated in recent months. Most recently, the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> reported Thursday that factory operating rates declined last month and industrial production levels held steady. Economist <PERSON> Maury </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> PaineWebber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> said the easingof factory use bodes well for slowing inflation because it reduces the likelihood of production bottlenecks and shortages that can push up prices. `` This is telling us that the economy still has plenty of room to run and the inflationary pressures are going to be cooling off,'' <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> said. `` It's going to take the pressure off ... inflation.'' <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> said he expects inflation to drop back down to the 4 percent range in the second half of the year, which should prompt the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> to again relax its monetary policy.

<HEAD>Annual Rate Rises to 8.3 Percent</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s annualized inflation rate rose to 8.3 percent in May from 8 percent in April, the government said Friday. The latest rate was lower than financial markets had expected but was higher than the peak of 8 percent that Chancellor of the Exchequer <PERSON> Nigel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> had forecast in March. The <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employment </ORGANIZATION> said its retail price index rose 0.6 percent in May from the previous month. The index stood at 115 in May, compared with 114.3 in April and 106.2 in May 1988. The index uses a January 1987 base of 100. Market forecasts called for an 8.4-percent annual rate and a 0.7 percent monthly rise. Employment Secretary <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Fowler </PERSON> said that if mortgage interest payments were excluded the rate of inflation would have been 6 percent in May. He said inflation `` is likely to fall back later in the year as a result of policies already in hand.'' `` There is continuing evidence that the action taken by the chancellor is beginning to work,'' <PERSON> Fowler </PERSON> said, pointing to a recent slowdown in retail sales and consumer borrowing growth as well as moderation in the rate of increase of producer prices. The government has pushed up interest rates 10 times in the last year to 14 percent from 7.5 percent in an effort to fight resurgent inflation. The annual inflation rate in May 1988 was 4.2 percent.

 <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> reached a tentative agreement Friday with 700 union workers, averting a threatened strike at three plants, a company official said.

The current contract expired at 12:01 a.m. Friday and union members had planned to strike, <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> said. The union represents technical engineers, laboratory personnel, writers and illustrators. The average salary is about $ 25,000, <PERSON> Ward </PERSON> said.

 Stock prices move higher Friday after a rebound in the value of the British pound. Traders also were relieved that British inflation was in line with expectations at 8.3 percent in May. The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index finished 14.3 points, or 0.7 percent, higher at 2,143.9, its peak for the day. The day's low came at the opening, when the index was down 5.5 points. Volume was 513.8 million shares, compared with 593.4 million Thursday. Some selective buying at the outset of a new two-week trading account also helped boost prices late in the day. <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s stock exchange divides trading into two-week and three-week trading periods for accounting purposes. The pounds's performance against the dollar was the major source of encouragement for the market, which has been plagued recently by worries that British interest rates might be pushed higher to bolster the pound. The pound was quoted late in the day at $ 1.5340 up from $ 1.5195 late Thursday.

 A civil trial is to begin Monday on Home Shopping Network's $ 1.5 billion lawsuit alleging that faulty <ORGANIZATION> GTE </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> equipment kept thousands of customers on hold waiting for idle sales operators. The trial in <ORGANIZATION> Pinellas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> also includes <LOCATION> Stamford </LOCATION>, Conn.-based <ORGANIZATION> GTE </ORGANIZATION>'s countering slander suit against the video retailer.

The St. Petersburg-based video retailer is seeking $ 500 million in damages and $ 1 billion in punitive damages. The newtork claims it lost $ 500 million in revenue because <ORGANIZATION> GTE </ORGANIZATION> telephone equipment kept thousands of customers waiting for sales operators who were n't busy. The <ORGANIZATION> GTE </ORGANIZATION> companies have denied wrongdoing and sued alleging slander and libel. They claim Home Shopping is blaming the telecommunications companies for its own managerial problems. The 12 counts in the original Home Shopping complaint have been reduced to four _ fraud, negligent misrepresentation, breach of trust and confidence, and breach of fiduciary duty. Home Shopping maintains that <ORGANIZATION> GTE </ORGANIZATION> employees lied to the cable television retailer and installed malfunctioning equipment and later covered up the problems.

 More than 10,000 coal miners in four states were off the job today to express sympathy for miners in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> who have waged a bitter strike since April against the <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>. Miners in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> today became the third and fourth states to report walkouts at coal companies. The sympathy strikes began Monday in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and spread to <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> late Thursday. One <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> representative said today that the <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> walkout was prompted by Thursday night's telecast of <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>' `` 48 Hours,'' which focused on the <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> strike, in which 1,600 miners have been off the job since April <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> dropped out of the <ORGANIZATION> Bituminous </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Operators </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> to negotiate with the union independently, and the two sides have failed to reach an agreement despite 16 months of negotiations. <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> officials gave conflicting indications of whether they are responsible for the wildcat strike. Some said they are asking union members to return to work, but <PERSON> Tommy </PERSON> <PERSON> Buchanan </PERSON>, international executive board member in <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> 20 in <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, said today the final decision on whether 5,000 <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> miners will join the strike will be with union President <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Trumka </PERSON>. `` It might be two days. It might be a week. It will start whenever it comes down from the union president,'' <PERSON> Buchanan </PERSON> said. Union spokesman <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Corcoran </PERSON> was not in his office and has not returned phone calls this week. The head of the coal industry bargaining unit said he had no plans to confer with the <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> on the wildcat strikes. `` I would no more try to tell someone else how to run their company than I would expect someone else to try to tell me how to run my company,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Quenon </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Peabody </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holding </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's largest coal producer, and chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Bituminous </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Operators </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Quenon </PERSON> flew to <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> on Thursday to meet with reporters and express <PERSON> Peabody </PERSON>'s and the association's concerns about the walkout. An estimated 2,300 <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> members stayed away from their jobs today in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>. Most worked for <ORGANIZATION> Rochester </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> operations in central <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, where 1,600 miners failed to report for work at midnight Thursday, said company spokesman <PERSON> Hank </PERSON> <PERSON> Waneck </PERSON> said. About 290 miners at <ORGANIZATION> Peabody </ORGANIZATION>'s Camp No. 1 mine in <LOCATION> Morganfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, did n't report for work today, said company spokesman <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Clarke </PERSON>. At least 270 miners were off the job at two mines in <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> today, spokesmen said. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> 11 in Terre Haute, attributed the action to the CBS show. `` When the miners saw that last night, that kind of set them off to where they decided to walk out,'' he said. About one-third of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>'s 24,000 miners were reported off the job today. Some 600 miners in <LOCATION> Wise </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, who walked out earlier in the week returned to work this morning. The coal companies contend the walkouts at companies other than <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> violate a no-strike clause in the 1988 national contract the union signed with the association. <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> did not take part in that agreement. Union officials have not returned phone calls this week, but in the past they have said they have not authorized the walkout. `` I think the union leadership ought to exercise its leadership role and do what they can to lead the miners back to work,'' <PERSON> Quenon </PERSON> said. `` That's why we have a union. That's why we have an agreement with the union _ to set out the terms and conditions under which we will have labor to run our coal mines. `` And we expect that to be honored.''

 The stock market remained mixed this afternoon as traders awaited an expected surge in activity later today due to the expiration of various futures and options. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was up 1.49 to 2,476.49 at 2 p.m. on Wall Street. Declining issues outpaced advances on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, with 731 down, 617 up and 553 unchanged. The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> composite index of all its listed common stocks was up 0.11 to 178.86. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 184.22 million shares with two hours left to go, exceeding Thursday's full-day volume of 179.48 million shares. Stock trading got off to a brisk start before settling down; more than 107 million shares changed hands in the first half hour of trading. Another surge in volume is expected to take place as the market closes. Investment analysts attributed the unusually heavy volume on Wall Street to manuevers associated with the expiration of stock-index futures, index options and options on individual stocks. This occurence commonly called the `` triple witching hour'' takes place once a quarter. Reports on inflation and the housing industry had little impact on stocks.

<HEAD>Goldome Drops Employee Secrecy Order, Announces Layoff Plans</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BUFFALO, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Goldome </ORGANIZATION> bank on Friday rescinded its controversial policy of threatening to cut the severance pay of laid-off workers unless they signed an agreement not to talk about losing their jobs. `` Our intention, to help assure the confidentiality of employee, customer and corporate information ... has been submerged by misperceptions of the agreement. This makes its continued use counterproductive,'' <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>, the chief executive, said in a statement. <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Goldome </ORGANIZATION> wants to cut staffing levels by 20 percent, or about 980 jobs nationwide. He said the company has already completed more than half of the job cuts, either through layoffs, attrition or the sale of business units. <ORGANIZATION> Goldome </ORGANIZATION>, one of the nation's largest thrifts, has lost $ 167 million in it last six quarters. Sources within the company said <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> wanted to keep the layoffs secret so customers would not lose confidence and withdraw their money. As many as 150 people had been terminated in the last 10 days and asked to sign the agreement, which prevented them from suing Goldome or discussing their layoff with anyone except `` counsel, personal tax adviser, immediate family or as required by law.'' If laid-off employees refused to sign, their severance benefits would have been cut to two weeks pay, down from a maximum of six. Nearly all of <ORGANIZATION> Goldome </ORGANIZATION>'s laid-off workers signed the agreement because they could not afford to lose the money, sources said. <ORGANIZATION> Goldome </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION>, employs 4,900 nationwide and has operations in two dozen states.

 The stock market remained mixed this afternoon as traders awaited an expected surge in activity late today due to expiration of various futures and options. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was up 9.70 to 2,484.70 at 3 p.m. on Wall Street. Declining issues held a narrow lead over advances on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, with 718 down, 680 up and 538 unchanged. The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> composite index of all its listed common stocks was ahed by 0.21 to 179.18. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 202.61 million shares with one hour left to go, exceeding Thursday's full-day volume of 179.48 million shares. Stock trading got off to a brisk start before settling down; more than 107 million shares changed hands in the first half hour of trading. Another surge in volume is expected to take place as the market closes. The unusually heavy volume on Wall Street reflects manuevers associated with the expiration of stock-index futures, index options and options on individual stocks. These simultaneous expirations occur once each quarter in something commonly called the `` triple witching hour.'' Reports on inflation and the housing industry appeared to have little impact on the stock market. The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the Consumer Price Index rose a sharp 0.6 percent in May, pushed up by strong increases in food and gasoline costs.

 Corn and soybean futures prices posted strong gains Friday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>, boosted by forecasts for warm, dry weather in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> next week. Wheat futures closed mixed. Meteorologists are continuing to call for a change to warmer and drier-than-normal conditions in the Corn Belt by late next week, stirring memories of last year's drought. Corn futures also were supported by expectations that the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> will extend certain corn loans to farmers that would keep some corn in storage that otherwise would move onto the market. The dollar's weakness was another bullish factor, since a weaker dollar could encourage foreign purchases of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> grain. `` The soybean complex has been trading with a kind of a wary eye on that dollar situation,'' said <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Gustafson </PERSON>, a grain-market analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>.

 An attorney representing a fired <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> manager said Friday the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> has been lax in taking action against falsification of records that led to fuel contamination at <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> LaGuardia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ira </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Furman </PERSON>, an attorney in <LOCATION> Woodmere </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, said he represents a former <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> maintenance manager at <ORGANIZATION> LaGuardia </ORGANIZATION> who has talked to the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney's Office about alleged violations that occurred at least a year ago. The former manager, whose was not identified, has said he initialed documents saying tests were made on jets parked overnight at <LOCATION> LaGuardia </LOCATION> when no tests actually were made, <PERSON> Furman </PERSON> said. The tests are to ensure the plane's fuel does not have too much water in it. Excess water can damage an engine or cause engine failure. `` This is like a whitewash,'' <PERSON> Furman </PERSON> said. `` The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> should have shut down operations at <LOCATION> LaGuardia </LOCATION>.'' `` It has taken a while for us to look into this case,'' said <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Bergen </PERSON>, a spokeswoman in <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION>'s Eastern District office. However, she said the delay was `` in the interest of thoroughness.'' <PERSON> Furman </PERSON>, a deputy director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> until 1987, said his client was granted immunity in the case last September. Eastern's maintenance and safety operations have come under increased scrutiny since the walkout of its Machinists union on March 4, with regulators trying to determine whether the strike has led to unsafe practices in <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s maintenance. Early last month, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> surrendered its repair station certificate at <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> John </LOCATION> <LOCATION> F. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kennedy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> after the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> determined the carrier failed to properly record and inspect maintenance work. The suspension of the JFK certificate was for actions that predated the start of the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> strike that was joined by pilots and flight attendants. The walkout virtually grounded Miami-based <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> and pushed it into bankruptcy court reorganization. On May 12, the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> completed a special investigation of record-keeping at <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s maintenance posts in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> to determine if violations of record-keeping rules such as those found at Kennedy were widespread. The final report has n't been submitted to acting <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> Administrator <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Whittington </PERSON>. But <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Barker </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, said Monday the agency told <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> informally that the inspection had revealed no irregularities. The former manager at <LOCATION> LaGuardia </LOCATION> asserted that <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s maintenance department there did n't even have the necessary tools to conduct the fuel tests and said he sometimes signed documents using made-up initials for nonexistent managers, <PERSON> Furman </PERSON> said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashlock </PERSON>, a spokesman for Eastern at its <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> headquarters, said there are no indications that aircraft safety was compromised at <LOCATION> LaGuardia </LOCATION>. He said the airline has cooperated with the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> in examining all available records relevant to the manager's accusations The former <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> manager said he became concerned after a superior told him they would not hire a lawyer for him if an accident occurred as a result of the non-testing. He refused to falsify any more documents, <PERSON> Furman </PERSON> said. Two weeks later the manager was fired on what he says are false charges that he smoked marijuana on the job, <PERSON> Furman </PERSON> said. The manager alerted the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> about the allegations in 1987 after losing an arbitration case over his firing, and has given the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> tape recordings and written documents, <PERSON> Furman </PERSON> said. The manager `` has put himself on the line,'' the attorney said. `` The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> had it laid out on a silver platter for them.'' The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION>'s inaction `` calls into question the effectiveness of the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> in rooting out problems at <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Furman </PERSON> said. Since 1983 176 accidents, resulting in 45 deaths, were caused by excess water in fuel, according to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>. None involved jets or major commercial carriers.

 A federal court Friday approved the bankruptcy reorganization of <ORGANIZATION> A.H. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Robins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, including $ 2.5 billion for women who claim they were injured by the company's <ORGANIZATION> Dalkon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shield </ORGANIZATION> birth control device sold widely in the 1970s. The 4th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> upheld all parts of the long-awaited restructuring of <ORGANIZATION> Robins </ORGANIZATION>, which will become a subsidiary of New York-based <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in a $ 700 million stock swap. `` I think it's just tremendous news for all <ORGANIZATION> Dalkon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shield </ORGANIZATION> claimants,'' said <PERSON> Guerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornton </PERSON>, attorney for the <ORGANIZATION> Dalkon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shield </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Victims </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. `` It means the decade wait for fair treatment and vindication of their rights is almost over.'' <PERSON> Robins </PERSON>, a Richmond-based pharmaceutical manufacturer, sought Chapter 11 federal bankruptcy protection from creditors in August 1985. The company faced millions of dollars in damage claims from women who said they suffered injuries including infections, sterility, miscarriage and having children born with birth defects caused by the Dalkon Shield intrauterine device. <PERSON> Robins </PERSON> distributed about 4.5 million Dalkon Shields in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and abroad before taking the device off the market in 1974. <PERSON> Robins </PERSON> paid about $ 520 million to settle 9,400 of some 15,000 Dalkon Shield lawsuits before seeking bankruptcy protection. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Morrison </PERSON>, attorney for the <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citizen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Litigation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, lead lawyer for opponents of the reorganization plan, said no decision had been made whether to appeal to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. In a series of four unanimous opinions, a three-judge panel of the appeals court upheld the entire scope of <PERSON> Robins </PERSON>' reorganization. In addition to a $ 2.5 billion settlement trust fund for about 200,000 Dalkon Shield claimants, the reorganization includes full payment to <PERSON> Robins </PERSON>' other creditors. The restructuring was designed over three years and approved in July 1988 by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Merhige </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Bankruptcy Judge <PERSON> Blackwell </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shelley </PERSON>, who presided jointly in the case. The ruling includes approval of a one claimant-one vote plan by which 95 percent of Dalkon Shield claimants ratified the settlement, and a separate cash settlement by <PERSON> Robins </PERSON>' insurance company. Lawyers for a group of claimants who opposed the plan contended that ratification vote Dalkon Shield users was flawed. They argued before the appeals court in December that women with larger claims should have had a greater voice in deciding the issue. The reorganization plan also bars claimants from filing third-party lawsuits to seek damages from <PERSON> Robins </PERSON>' officers or its insurer, another aspect opposed by some claimants. <ORGANIZATION> Aetna </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Casualty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Surety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Robins </PERSON>' insurer, paid $ 425 million to the trust to settle any claims against it. The claimants contended <ORGANIZATION> Aetna </ORGANIZATION> was an active participant in marketing the Dalkon Shield and should have been liable for claims beyond those covered by the $ 2.5 billion trust. But the three-member appeals court panel rejected the argument, citing the likelihood of conflicting decisions on liability if <ORGANIZATION> Aetna </ORGANIZATION> had to face trial in different courts on essentially the same question. The court also ruled that while the one claimant-one vote method of approving the reorganization denied weighted voting, `` at most, harmless error was committed'' because almost 95 percent of claimants endorsed the plan. Based on expert testimony, $ 2.5 billion was the estimated cost of full compensation for all <ORGANIZATION> Dalkon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shield </ORGANIZATION> claimants, <PERSON> Robins </PERSON> attorney <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> said. Only $ 100 million of the $ 2.5 billion compensation package to <ORGANIZATION> Dalkon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shield </ORGANIZATION> claimants has been available during the appeal. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheppard </PERSON>, director of the trust fund's claims resolution facility, said $ 52 million of the initial $ 100 million already has been paid to 77,662 claimants. Also at issue on appeal was whether Judge <PERSON> Merhige </PERSON> interfered with the five-member trustee board handling the claimants' compensation fund. Last November, <PERSON> Merhige </PERSON> removed three of the trustees because of slow progress in setting up a procedure for resolving initial claims. The appeals court on Friday upheld the judge's action.

 A rally in the dollar fizzled Friday one day after a sharp sell-off, leaving it higher against the British pound, Canadian dollar and Swiss franc but lower against other major currencies. The dollar rose from late Thursday levels in <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> and early European trading despite central banks' dollar sales, but it failed to hold ground after a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> report showed inflation in May at the high end of expectations. Thursday's panicky selling appeared to have altered the bullish psychology that had carried the dollar to its highest levels since 1987 or late 1986 against some currencies, traders said. `` The same inflation number last week would have pushed the dollar definitely higher,'' said <PERSON> Bernd </PERSON> <PERSON> Becker </PERSON>, chief trader for <ORGANIZATION> Oesterreichische </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laenderbank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the Consumer Price Index rose 0.6 percent in May. High inflation increases the chance the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> will keep interest rates high to keep the economy from overheating. Higher rates attract global money into dollars. But nervous speculators used the report as an opportunity to sell. Also pushing down the dollar, <PERSON> Becker </PERSON> said, was a report out of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> quoting sources saying the central banks of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> had agreed to intervene jointly to hold down the dollar outside their home markets. `` I think the market really got shaken by what happened,'' <PERSON> Becker </PERSON> said, referring to Thursday's session, in which the dollar lost 2.5 percent or more of its value against the pound, West German mark and Japanese yen. `` Billions of dollars were bought at top levels when it looked like it was a one-way street up. Now speculators are going to use any higher levels to sell,'' he said. Dealers said trading was erratic, with the dollar's movement exaggerated by thin volume. Many market players chose to stay on the sidelines after being burned by Thursday's sharp swings. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the dollar fell against the British pound. It cost $ 1.5340 to buy one pound, more than $ 1.5195 late Thursday. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> the pound fell to $ 1.5410 from $ 1.5510 late Thursday in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The dollar fell 6.25 yen to a closing 145.05 yen in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. Later, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it was quoted at 145.50 yen. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> the dollar fell to 144.70 yen from 145.40 on Thursday. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, compared with late Thursday's rates, included: 1.9810 West German marks, down from 1.9845; 1.7110 Swiss francs, up from 1.7095; 1.1973 Canadian dollars, up from 1.1966; 6.7290 French francs, down from 6.7390; and 1,441 Italian lire, down from 1,443. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, compared with late Thursday: 1.9915 West German marks, down from 2.0235; 1.7213 Swiss francs, down from 1.7490; 6.7620 French francs, down from 6.8680; 2.2385 Dutch guilders, down from 2.2915; 1,443.50 Italian lire, down from 1,472.00; 1.1973 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1993. Gold prices rose overseas, catching up with gains made Thursday in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. But they fell in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trading. In <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, gold rose $ 5.10 a troy ounce to close at a bid $ 366.67. Gold rose in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to a late bid of $ 363.75 from Thursday's $ 362.50. In <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, gold rose to a bid $ 363.75 from $ 361.71 late Thursday. On the Commodity Exchange in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> gold bullion for current delivery fell to $ 365.10 an ounce from $ 367 on Thursday. Later, <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> said gold was bid at $ 364 as of 4 p.m. EDT, down from $ 366.80 late Thursday. Silver bullion prices fell on the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> market where the metal was trading at a late bid price of $ 5.27 a troy ounce, compared with Thursday's $ 5.29. On <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Comex, silver bullion for current delivery fell to $ 5.285 an ounce from $ 5.309 Thursday.

<HEAD>Kodak Consolidates Divisions, To Cut Hundreds of Jobs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROCHESTER, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Eastman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said Friday it will consolidate its consumer photography products and picture finishing operations, cutting costs and hundreds of jobs. Four operations will be merged in the newly created Consumer Imagery Division, said company spokesman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> said the move would strengthen its consumer photography business, part of the firm's imaging segment, which made a dismal showing when <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION>'s first-quarter earnings were announced in May. By year's end, the new division will include the consumer products, photofinishing and <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> sales divisions, he said. It also will include the administrative service area within the photo products group, said <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>. `` If you look at the stock over the last couple of weeks, there has been a lot of speculation after the first-quarter earnings release ... that there could be a major restructuring or a hostile takeover or spinoff,'' said <PERSON> Alex </PERSON> <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` I am very strongly of the opinion that those basic rumors that got the stock to rally ... are unfounded.'' <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> stock fell 12 -LCB- cents Friday to $ 48.62 -LCB- in consolidated <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> trading. <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> profits were down 23 percent in the first quarter and the company had problems making money selling products overseas, caused by the increasing strength of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar overseas and foreign competition. <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> has also had to absorb costs from last year's purchase of Sterling Drug Co In the imaging segment, operating earnings fell from $ 201 million in last year's first quarter to $ 160 million the same period this year. <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION>'s plan included cutting several hundred jobs from the work force, but the exact number would not be determined until summer's end, said <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> The job cuts would occur in support areas and would be primarily confined to the company's <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION> headquarters, said <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>. `` There will be no major impact in the field among our sales force or at our manufacturing facilities,'' <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> Vice Chairman <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillip </PERSON> <PERSON> Samper </PERSON> said the company `` will view consumer photography as single business'' driven by the recognition that `` consumers see photography as a natural sequence involving cameras, films and photofinishing.'' Separately, <ORGANIZATION> Xerox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> announced in <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION> that 680 employees nationwide have been accepted in a voluntary reduction program that <ORGANIZATION> Xerox </ORGANIZATION> announced in March, including 170 in the <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION> area where <ORGANIZATION> Xerox </ORGANIZATION> has its largest manufacturing work force. While the voluntary reductions wo n't guarantee against future layoffs, said spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Rasor </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Xerox </ORGANIZATION> had originally predicted that only 250 to 350 would take advantage of the program.

<TEXT>
 Petroleum futures prices fell sharply Friday as the market relaxed its concerns over supply problems and traders cashed in gains achieved earlier in the week, analysts said. On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the July contract for <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Intermediate, the benchmark grade of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude, finished 62 cents lower at $ 19.95 a barrel. The drop retraced most of the 69 cents the contract had gained since last Friday's $ 19.88 close. Other contract months showed smaller declines. Among refined products, unleaded gasoline for July delivery dropped 1.30 cents to 58.14 cents a gallon, while July heating oil fell 0.55 cent to 45.71 cents a gallon. Other product contracts also declined. Analysts said the market had been overbought in recent days. `` You're bound to see profit-taking coming in basically as a result of it,'' said <PERSON> Nauman </PERSON> <PERSON> Barakat </PERSON>, vice president of energy investments at <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. Some observers had attributed the recent rise in July crude oil to concerns about pipeline distribution problems that resulted in some customers receiving foreign crude in place of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Intermediate. Although the delivered crude met specifications, customers used to receiving West Texas Intermediate were concerned about supplies, analysts said. `` The short-term scare is over,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Steel </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Refco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` That led to a relaxation in the market and made the market go down.''

<HEAD>Honeywell To Cut 300 Corporate Jobs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MINNEAPOLIS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Honeywell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> will cut its corporate staff by 300, mostly through layoffs, the defense contractor and building controls maker said Friday. Seventy-five of the jobs will be lost to attrition, while the balance of the cuts will be made with layoffs and some early retirements, said <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Eich </PERSON>, a company spokeswoman. The company's stock jumped $ 1.50 a share Friday to close at $ 75.12 -LCB- in composite trading on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Employees will know by June 26 if they are going to be laid off, <PERSON> Eich </PERSON> said. The same day, <ORGANIZATION> Honeywell </ORGANIZATION> will open an office designed to find new jobs outside the company for the laid-off workers, she said. About 200 of the cuts will be made at the company's <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION> headquarters in such departments as human resources, legal, communications and general office services. <ORGANIZATION> Honeywell </ORGANIZATION> has about 18,000 employees in the <ORGANIZATION> Twin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cities </ORGANIZATION> and 78,000 employees worldwide. The rest of the cuts will be scattered in field offices across the country, she said. The company said it was trimming its workforce to save money. In 1988, <ORGANIZATION> Honeywell </ORGANIZATION> lost $ 435 million. In the first quarter of 1989 it had earnings of $ 62.9 million, or $ 1.36 a share. The layoffs announced Friday followed a cut of 1,200 employees announced in December.

 <ORGANIZATION> Strikebound </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> has agreed to sell its eight <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> airport gates, 16 jets and other assets to <ORGANIZATION> Midway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> for $ 206.5 million, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> said Friday. The move heads off threatened antitrust action by the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to block <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s earlier proposed sale of the <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> gates and two U.S.-Canadian routes to <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. Eastern announced the Midway deal at a federal bankruptcy court hearing over its earlier agreement with Washington-based <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Bankruptcy Judge <PERSON> Burton </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lifland </PERSON> gave <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> permission to terminate that agreement, but still must approve the sale to Chicago-based Midway. Eastern sought bankruptcy protection from creditors on March 9, five days after the start of a strike by Machinists that was joined by pilots and flight attendants. The sale of the <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> assets is part of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s plan to reorganize as a smaller carrier and sell $ 1.8 billion in assets. <PERSON> Lifland </PERSON> on Wednesday had approved <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s agreement to sell 15 aircraft for $ 277.5 million to <ORGANIZATION> UAS-Invest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The unions have opposed the plan, but have been unsuccessful in finding a buyer for the entire airline. On Thursday, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Winpisinger </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION>, said he saw a `` seven-in-10 chance'' that the bankruptcy court would approve <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s downsizing plan. Referring to <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s parent <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Winpisinger </PERSON> said, `` It's distinctly possible he can win and survive.'' <PERSON> Winpisinger </PERSON> made his remarks to the <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> annual convention in French Lick, <LOCATION> Ind </LOCATION>. A buyout plan for Eastern proposed by the unions and <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> commodities trader <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Ritchie </PERSON> remains under discussion, but <PERSON> Lifland </PERSON> has said the first priority should be talks over the airline's proposed reorganization. Midway agreed to purchase <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s eight <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> gates, its routes from <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Montreal </LOCATION>, two landing slots at <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> LaGuardia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, two slots at <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> National </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, and 16 <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> DC-9 aircraft. Used DC-9 jets generally fetch around $ 3 million each, industry experts say. Eastern attorney <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Zirinsky </PERSON> told <PERSON> Lifland </PERSON> the airline held negotiations through Thursday night and into Friday morning with officials of Midway, which previously had expressed interest in <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> assets. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> planned to sue to block the planned $ 85 million sale to <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s airport gates in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> and its <LOCATION> Philadelphia-Toronto </LOCATION> route. The sale also would have included <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s Philadelphia-Montreal route but the department did n't object to that element The department contended the sale to <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> threatened to lessen competition in airline service between <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> and other cities. <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> already has nearly a third of the flights into and out of <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. The state of <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> also challenged the proposed <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> purchase, saying the transaction could lead to higher ticket prices. `` Obviously, we're disappointed in what happened. But the deal is over. That's it,'' said <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bronson </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashby </PERSON>, a spokesman for the pilots union, said the unions planned to object in court to the proposed Midway sale. `` We believe that <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> is an integral part of the Eastern system,'' <PERSON> Ashby </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Cattle Futures Expected To Rally After Surprising USDA Report</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Live cattle futures prices posted modest gains Friday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> and experts predicted a surge next week after a government report showed an unexpectedly sharp drop in May placements of cattle on feedlots. On other markets, energy prices tumbled; grains and soybeans were mixed; and precious metals retreated. Live cattle settled .13 cent to .30 cent higher with the contract for delivery in June at 71.70 cents a pound; feeder cattle were unchanged to .18 cent lower with August at 80.97 cents a pound; live hogs were .05 cent to .60 cent higher with June at 48.22 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .38 cent lower to 1.15 cents higher witth July at 33.92 cents a pound. Cattle futures prices had been rising ahead of the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s monthly cattle-on-feed report. Expectations were that it would show about a 15 percent decline in the number of cattle placed on feedlots last month in the seven largest producer states compared with the record-high placements of May 1988. But the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> indicated an even sharper drop in May placements, reporting 25 percent fewer cattle were moved from pastures to feedlots last month than a year ago. The seven-state total of 1.6 million cattle was 11 percent below the 10-year average and represented the lightest May placements since 1981. The placements brought the total number of cattle on feed in the seven states to 7.5 million, 3 percent below a year ago. There are two major reasons for the lower placements. Last year's drought dried up pasturelands and forced calf-and-cattle producers to sell more of their animals to feedlots earlier in the year than normal, which led to record-high placements in May 1988 This year's spring rains had the opposite effect. `` The rain improved your pasture conditions and just slowed down that movement of cattle off of pastures into the feedlots,'' said <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Durchholz </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Agri-Visor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bloomington </LOCATION>, Ill. The low placements will result in tighter supplies of slaughter-ready cattle in late summer and early fall, and will likely push cattle and beef prices higher. Analysts said the contracts for August and October cattle deliveries should see the greatest gains on Monday, with prices expected to open .50 cent to 1 cent higher. Petroleum futures prices plummeted on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> on signs of easing supplies of crude oil for prompt delivery and reports that the <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> cartel may raise its production ceiling by 1 million barrels per day in September. West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 1 cent to 62 cents lower with July at $ 19.95 a barrel; heating oil was .21 cent to .63 lower with July at 45.71 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was 1.34 cents lower to .10 cent higher with July at 58.14 cents a gallon. Most corn and soybean futures posted strong gains on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>, boosted by forecasts for a warmup in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> next week. Wheat futures closed mixed. Corn futures also were supported by expectations the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> will extend certain corn loans to farmers, which would keep in storage some corn that would otherwise move onto the market. Wheat settled unchanged to 3 \ cents higher with the contract for delivery in July at $ 3.94 \ a bushel; corn was 1 -LCB- cents lower to 3 -LCB- cents higher with July at $ 2.62 -RCB- a bushel; oats were \ cent to 2 cents lower with July at $ 1.64 -LCB- a bushel; soybeans were 1 cent lower to 7 -LCB- cents higher with July at $ 7.33 a Gold and silver futures prices fell modesty after rising for four straight days on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Gold settled $ 1.90 to $ 2 lower with August at $ 368.80 a troy ounce; silver was 0.6 cent to 2.5 cents lower with July at $ 5.305 a troy ounce.

 The stock market moved ahead Friday in the heaviest trading volume in about five months as buyers braved the `` triple witching hour.'' The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 11.38 to 2,486.38, but lost 27.04 points from a week earlier. Gainers outnumbered losers by about 9 to 7 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed stocks, with 811 up, 626 down and 544 unchanged. Volume on the floor of the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 244.51 million shares, up from 179.48 million in the previous session. The unusually heavy volume on Wall Street reflected trades associated with the expiration of stock-index futures, index options and options on individual stocks. The set of expirations occur once each quarter in something commonly called the `` triple witching hour.'' Most of the trading was concentrated around the opening and closing of the session. Traders paid little attention to two government economic reports. `` I do n't think the market moved on economic news today,'' said <PERSON> Newton </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Zinder </PERSON>, analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, adding that traders were preoccupied with `` triple witching hour'' strategies. The <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the Consumer Price Index rose 0.6 percent in May, driven up by strong increases in food and gasoline costs. Last month's rise, close to analysts' estimates, followed a 0.7 percent April increase and was taken as a sign that inflation continues to be a problem for the American economy. In a separate report, the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said housing construction continued to decline in May and starts on new homes fell 2.1 percent from the previous month to the lowest level since the last recession in 1982. <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> dominated the list of actively traded NYSE-listed stocks on news that <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> intends to launch a $ 70-a-share tender offer for <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> instead of merging with <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> in a stock swap. More than 8.2 million <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> shares changed hands in NYSE-composite trading and the stock wound up with a gain of 3 | at 59 Time, which also said it has rejected a $ 175-a-share takeover bid from <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION>, tumbled 9 to 162 -LCB-.

 Court approval Friday of <ORGANIZATION> A.H. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Robins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s reorganization should end more than a decade of waiting for thousands of women seeking compensation for injuries from the Dalkon Shield birth control device `` There is some justice in the world,'' said <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Hightower </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Dalkon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shield </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Victims </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> and a claimant. `` This is absolutely wonderful.'' The 4th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> affirmed <ORGANIZATION> A.H. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Robins </ORGANIZATION> bankruptcy reorganization plan with $ 2.5 billion set aside for women claiming injuries from the intrauterine device sold widely in the early 1970s. The money can not be distributed until appeals to the plan are exhausted. About 200,000 claims against the Richmond-based pharmaceutical manufacturer are outstanding. An appeal to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> is possible, but analysts and attorneys said the high court is unlikely to hear the case because the appellate court gave an across-the-board ratification. <PERSON> Constance </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dalkon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shield </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Victims </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, who opposed the plan, said she believes the reorganization does not provide adequate compensation. `` I feel very disappointed,'' Ms. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said. `` We're not being treated fairly in this whole business.'' She said the ruling means women who have not yet filed claims or gotten medical records together need to do so before time runs out. <PERSON> Sandy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reina </PERSON>, a claimant who leads a victims' association in <LOCATION> Baton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rouge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La. </LOCATION>, said the decision is important for women awaiting payments before they can undergo reproductive surgery or attempt in vitro fertilization. `` A lot of the women here are about to fall apart from wondering what was going to happen,'' Ms. <PERSON> Reina </PERSON> said. `` I think most of us are ready to go forward and get this thing over with.'' Ms. <PERSON> Reina </PERSON> said she had a total hysterectomy after years of pain from wearing the Dalkon Shield. `` For me personally, it's time to let the manufacturers wake up and tell them ` Do n't put any more things out there and use us as guinea pigs,''' she said. <PERSON> Robins </PERSON> distributed about 4.5 million Dalkon Shields in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and abroad before taking the device off the market in 1974. <PERSON> Robins </PERSON> paid about $ 520 million to settle 9,400 of some 15,000 Dalkon Shield lawsuits before seeking bankruptcy protection in 1985. Ms. <PERSON> Hightower </PERSON> said she has received calls `` daily and nightly'' from claimants worried because the appeals decision had taken since December to be handed down. `` So many of them believed they had been used by <PERSON> A.H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robins </PERSON> and were beginning to doubt the court system,'' she said. `` Now they can see there's a light at the end of the tunnel.'' Ms. <PERSON> Hightower </PERSON>, who became pregnant in 1972 while using the Dalkon Shield and gave birth to a brain-damaged child, said approval of the plan will help ease some of her anger toward <PERSON> A.H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robins </PERSON>. `` Once these women get a check in their hands, it wo n't compensate for their injuries or the children they do n't have, but it's proof that they did something about it,'' she said

 Four groups said Friday they remain in the running to buy <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> parent <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a major takeover firm also was rumored to be a front-runner and one former suitor dropped out. <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, oil billionaire <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>'s machinists' union and a group led by <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> investor <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Checchi </PERSON> said they met Friday's deadline for revised bids for the owner of <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's fourth-largest carrier Two of those bidders, who asked not to be identified, said they believed the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> takeover firm <ORGANIZATION> Kohlberg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kravis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Roberts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> also submitted an offer. <PERSON> Kohlberg </PERSON> <PERSON> Kravis </PERSON> would not comment. Analysts have said the winning Northwest bid could be as high as $ 120 a share, or $ 3.5 billion. <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> stock closed up 12 -LCB- cents at $ 107.62 -LCB- Friday on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> MEI </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diversified </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>, led by <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Twins </ORGANIZATION> owner and banker <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Pohlad </PERSON> and including financier <PERSON> Irwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON>, said it would not revise its initial offer. MEI President <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Benson </PERSON> did not return telephone calls seeking comment on why MEI was dropping out. A four-member committee of the <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> board announced June 5 it had rejected all first-round bids. It asked for `` enhanced'' revisions, saying it would favor a high price, low level of debt and an ability to complete a deal quickly in lieu of takeover scrutiny by federal regulators. <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> has declined to identify the bidders or say when a decision would be made. <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Rothmeier </PERSON> has said the board may decide not to sell the company, possibly opting instead for a special dividend payment to shareholders, acquisition of another company, liquidation of the airline or sale of more than 20 percent of <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> stock to a friendly third party. `` I do n't think the bidding will go a third round and I think you'll get a decision next week,'' said <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Piper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jaffray </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Hopwood </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> KKR </ORGANIZATION>, which specializes in buying companies with borrowed money in deals known as leveraged buyouts, completed the largest deal in history with the $ 24.53 billion takeover of <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> earlier this year. <PERSON> Checchi </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Marriott </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> executive, has been described by <PERSON> Rothmeier </PERSON> as a friendly suitor. His group includes <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> board member, and <PERSON> Frederic </PERSON> <PERSON> Malek </PERSON>, an unsuccessful candidate for the president's job at <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> who once headed <ORGANIZATION> Marriott </ORGANIZATION>'s hotel group. <ORGANIZATION> KLM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dutch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> is an equity partner in the <PERSON> Checchi </PERSON> group, which also has backing from Elder <ORGANIZATION> IXL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, an Australian investment holding company. A source in the <PERSON> Checchi </PERSON> group confirmed it met Friday's bidding deadline but declined to elaborate. <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Plaskett </PERSON> said his company's revised bid includes $ 200 million in equity from <ORGANIZATION> Corporate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Partners </ORGANIZATION>, an investment fund organized by <ORGANIZATION> Lazard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Freres </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and managed by <PERSON> Lester </PERSON> <PERSON> Pollack </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wambold </PERSON>. That brings the total amount of equity in the <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> proposal to $ 600 million, <PERSON> Plaskett </PERSON> said. No other details of the offer were disclosed but spokeswoman <PERSON> Pamela </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanlon </PERSON> said the bid still includes bank financing and subordinated debt placed with private institutions. The earlier <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> bid included $ 2.7 billion in bank financing. Analysts said <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> has an uphill battle for <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> because a merger probably would result in more debt than any other proposed deal. <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's eighth-largest carrier, is more than $ 900 million in debt and <PERSON> Plaskett </PERSON> has said the company needs to acquire another airline or be acquired. A spokesman for <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>, who opened the bidding for Northwest on March 28 with a $ 90-a-share or $ 2.7 billion offer, said <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> has submitted a `` new and very full'' offer. No details were disclosed, but the spokesman said it was <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>' final bid <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> Cook </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lodge </ORGANIZATION> 143, would not disclose details of the union's revised bid. The machinists account for about 20,000 of <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>'s 35,000 employees.

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Nation, the 125-year-old weekly magazine, jumped into the takeover fray for <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> on Friday _ but its buyout proposal offered more in the way of wry commentary than cash or stocks. `` Ever since the <ORGANIZATION> Reagan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> abandoned its enforcement of the antitrust laws and the <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION> abandoned their plan to put a cap on conglomerate size, we've been looking for a way to do our part to protect the free enterprise system,'' wrote Editor <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Navasky </PERSON>. `` Now we have found it.'' <PERSON> Navasky </PERSON> said he made his overture in a letter to Time Chairman <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Munro </PERSON> that is being reprinted in the July 3 issue of The Nation, due to appear on newstands next week. `` A white knight is coming to your rescue,'' <PERSON> Navasky </PERSON> wrote <PERSON> Munro </PERSON>, who heads the <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> board that on Friday rejected a $ 10.7 billion buyout offer from <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. Mimicking the lingo of investment bankers _ and casting a broadside at the debt-financed buyout trend of the 1980s _ <PERSON> Navasky </PERSON> wrote that his company was highly confident it could do better than <ORGANIZATION> Paramount </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 175 a share bid. `` Like other potential suitors, our plan is to pledge the assets of <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> as collateral on the loan we take to buy you out, so cash will be no problem,'' he wrote. In support of the bid, <PERSON> Navasky </PERSON> noted that The Nation, which has been published continuously since 1865 and lost money for all but three of those years. `` Our tax-loss carryforward is staggering,'' he said. He also pointed out that delays in completing the deal should be no problem for the weekly, because `` nothing we do takes more than a week.'' Once the deal was complete, <PERSON> Navasky </PERSON> said, The Nation would give <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Book-of-the-Month </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Box </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> cable service, People and Time magazines and all the company's other properties their independence. `` ... as a magazine founded by abolitionists, we believe in freeing the corporate slaves,'' he wrote. He said that idea should appeal to shareholders, who would retain proportionate shares in all of the enterprises, and the editors and publishers of Time's various enterprises, who would n't have Paramount or The Nation looking over their shoulders. `` ... we are even prepared to consider having the various sections of Time -LRB- `` Nation,'' `` World,'' `` Milestones,'' etc. -RRB- spun off as independent entities,'' <PERSON> Navasky </PERSON> wrote. `` But all of that is subject to negotiation.''

 Supermarkets in four states plan to hand out coupons in exchange for purchases, which will be tracked by special cards distributed to customers, a spokeswoman said Thursday. The program in supermarkets in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> is aimed at encouraging customer loyalty and finding out what people buy, said <PERSON> Montine </PERSON> <PERSON> Clapper </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Safeway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION>. The cards will electronically record the items bought and their value, <PERSON> Clapper </PERSON> said. In <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, participating customers can earn up to seven coupons a month at the rate of one coupon for every $ 50 spent in Safeway stores, she said. Each month, participants will get a list of about 100 name-brand products that qualify for discounts and a statement detailing their purchases and how much credit they've earned. At the end of three months, customers will receive a voucher that can be applied toward purchases at the store. The program will work similarly at <ORGANIZATION> Pathmark </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Vons </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Publix </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Giant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> stores in the other states, <PERSON> Clapper </PERSON> said. `` It's free and convenient ... no register tapes to count,'' she said. `` We're getting information on our customers as to shopping habits, trends, what they're interested in ... so we can better turn around and see what they're interested in seeing in our Safeway stores.'' <ORGANIZATION> Safeway </ORGANIZATION>'s program began with a test in <LOCATION> Greeley </LOCATION> about 1 -LCB- years ago, then expanded into <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Collins </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> area stores, <PERSON> Clapper </PERSON> said.

 The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> passed a $ 157 billion savings and loan bailout Thursday night, supporting President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s demand for tough industry reforms but rejecting his plan to prevent the costs from swelling the federal deficit. On a 320-97 vote the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> approved the biggest financial rescue in history from a crisis caused largely by risky and often fraudulent lending of federally insured deposits, primarily in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. Fifty-one Democrats and 46 Republicans voted against the bill. Voting for the bill were 196 Democrats and 124 Republicans. `` The <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> taxpayers won a major victory today when the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> voted for strong, tangible capital requirements ...,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>. `` They have taken a very positive step toward ensuring the resolution of the savings and loan crisis.'' At the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said in a conference call to news organizations, `` We are pleased by this bipartisan step toward final passage ... We applaud the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> leadership for moving this bill rapidly through the House.'' The vote on final passage occurred after Rep. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Leach </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, the leading Republican crusader against S & amp; L abuses in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, won an amendment to eliminate several special-interest provisions benefitting specific companies. Among the provisions eliminated were those aimed at helping <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interstate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Citicorp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Paine </PERSON> <PERSON> Webber </PERSON> and other brokerage houses; <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Great </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, one of the largest S & amp; Ls in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had threatened earlier Thursday to veto the measure if the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> adopted an industry-sought amendment by Rep. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hyde </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ill </LOCATION>., to give 241 thrift institutions a mechanism to escape having to raise $ 6 billion in new capital as a hedge against future loan losses The amendment was defeated by a 326-94 vote after <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> issued his veto threat and Democrats repeated assertions that it would gut the reforms needed to prevent an recurrence of the crisis. `` This amendment would have allowed weak institutions to delay and delay and delay the day of reckoning,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION> `` And while they delay and delay and delay, the taxpayers pay and pay and pay.'' The bill next goes to a conference committee of lawmakers who will iron out differences from a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> version approved two months ago. With S & amp; L losses mounting at a rate of nearly $ 40 million a day, the administration wants the bill enacted into law before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> takes its August vacation. Before enacting the bill, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> rejected on a largely party-line 280-146 vote <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s plan to finance the bailout through high-cost, 30-year off-budget bonds rather than new borrowing directly through the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>. `` This is a vote to save the taxpayer $ 5 billion in interest costs,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ill </LOCATION>., chairman of the tax-writing <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Only Democrats <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON> <PERSON> Hubbard </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Tommy </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> supported <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s plan. Also rejected by a similar margin was an effort to force a tax increase or massive spending cuts to pay for the bailout. However, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> amended <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s original proposal on a 208-206 vote to make the industry subsidize low-income housing by $ 75 million to $ 150 million a year and outlaw S & amp; L investments in junk bonds. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> also adopted a amendment opposed by the administration as well as the <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; L and banking industries to make lenders disclose data on their lending by race and locality in an effort to wipe out so-called `` redlining'' discrimination. Basically the bill calls for spending a total of $ 285 billion _ including interest over the next 30 years _ to close or merge between 450 and 600 of the nation's 2,938 <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls whose estimated losses total about $ 100 billion. Of the total spending, about $ 157 billion would come from taxpayers and the balance from the industry, according to the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>. Only 56 of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>'s 175 Republicans ended up supporting <PERSON> Hyde </PERSON>'s measure after GOP Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> reluctantly switched sides in response to a strong letter from <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> appealing for support Democrats voted 212-38 to reject the amendment. <PERSON> Hyde </PERSON>'s measure would have required federal regulators to grant hearings to marginally healthy S & amp; Ls before phasing out exemptions to capital requirements granted by regulators in the early 1980s for `` supervisory good will.'' In a letter to <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> just before the vote, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said approval of the <PERSON> Hyde </PERSON> amendment `` would render this bill unacceptable to me.'' The president said that `` giving recognition to good will as capital ... is not justifiable.'' `` There should be no mistake,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wrote. `` This matter goes to the very heart of my determination to clean up the abuses of the past among the savings and loans, about which every voter is entitled to be outraged.'' In April, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> defeated by a 50-48 vote an effort by Democrats to make the bailout part of the deficit. And Sen. <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Gramm </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Texas </LOCATION>, has collected signatures from 40 colleagues over the last week pledging to support <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s financing plan. <PERSON> Hyde </PERSON> said his `` good will'' amendment was intended only to grant the constitutional right of a hearing to the 8 percent of the industry that took over failing thrifts in the early 1980s and saved taxpayers $ 13 billion then. `` The S & amp; Ls who find themselves victimized by this legislation are not the bad guys, the high flyers,'' he said. `` The only sin they're guilty of is trusting the federal regulators They deserve a hearing before the sword falls, before the scarlet letter is placed on their forehead.'' Critics, however, said <PERSON> Hyde </PERSON>'s amendment would have gutted the chief reform elements of the bailout _ assuring that every S & amp; L owner puts up some of it own money as a buffer between risky loans that may go bad and the federal deposit insurance fund. The fund is now running an estimated deficit of $ 55 billion that is growing by at about $ 40 million a day because the government lacks the money to close some 450 insolvent S & amp; Ls and pay off their depositors.

<HEAD>Bond Prices Decline</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Bond prices edged lower Friday following the government's report that consumer prices rose sharply in May. The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>'s closely watched 30-year bond slipped 3-16 point, or $ 1.87 for every $ 1,000 in face value. Its yield, which moves in the opposite direction from price, was unchanged from late Thursday at 8.30 percent. Analysts said bond prices were weakened by the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report that the Consumer Price Index rose 0.6 percent in May, sending inflation to an annual rate of 6.7 percent for the first five months of the year. High inflation is a bad sign for credit markets because it erodes the value of fixed-income securities such as bonds. `` The CPI number scared a few people,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sebastian </PERSON>, executive vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Clayton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. The market had rallied in recent weeks on the dollar's rapid advance and signs that the economy was moderating. But bond prices declined sharply Thursday when the dollar tumbled in foreign exchange. The inflation report made traders more apprehensive. `` We've seen the slowdown in the economy. Unfortunately we have n't seen the slowdown in the inflation numbers,'' said <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> A </PERSON>. <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>, an economist with <ORGANIZATION> BankAmerica </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Markets </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. In the secondary market for <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> securities, prices of short-term government issues slipped 1-16 point to 5-32 point, intermediate maturities also declined 1-16 point to 5-32 point, and 20-year issues fell 5-32 point, according to figures provided by <ORGANIZATION> Telerate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a financial information service. The movement of a point is equivalent to a change of $ 10 in the price of a bond with a $ 1,000 face value. The <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Bond Index, which measures price movements on all outstanding <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> issues with maturities of a year or longer, fell 1.16 at 1,169.25. In corporate trading, industrials also declined. <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION>'s Investment Grade Corporate Bond Index, which measures total return on a portfolio of 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years or longer, slipped 1.69 to 322.50 In the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively traded municipal bonds rose 7-32 point. The average yield to maturity was 7.30 percent, down from 7.33 percent late Thursday. Yields on three-month <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bills rose to 8.40 percent as the discount increased 5 basis points to 8.13 percent. Yields on six-month bills rose to 8.38 percent as the discount jumped 7 basis points to 7.95 percent. Yields on one-year bills rose to 8.54 percent as the discount soared 7 basis points to 7.94 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield is the annualized return on an investment in a <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bill. The discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face value, which is paid at maturity. The federal funds rate, the interest banks charge each other for short-term loans, was quoted late Friday at 97-16 percent, unchanged from late Thursday.

 State gaming regulators Friday approved <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>'s $ 63 million offer for the <ORGANIZATION> Elsinore </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Atlantis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Casino </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hotel </ORGANIZATION>, ending a struggle over <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>'s first failed casino. The commission said it was not convinced <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> was gaining too much power in <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and voted to approve the billionaire developer's purchase of the closed casino, which <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> plans to turn into a luxury hotel. `` I am satisfied ... that the proposed acquisition of Atlantis would not unacceptably affect the competitive climate that exists in <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>,'' commission chairman <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Read </PERSON> said before the 5-0 vote. The commission rejected recommendations by the Division of Gaming Enforcement to impose several major conditions on the deal, including a ban on future Trump acquisitions of casino-zoned real estate. <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> representatives told the commission the conditions would end the deal. <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> already owns two <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> casinos and has a third under construction. Over objections from two commissioners, the panel did require <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> to gain commission approval before building more hotels or buying more land zoned for casinos. The Atlantis acquisition leaves <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> with control of 34 percent of the city's casino hotel rooms, 31 percent of casino floor space and revenue, and 48 percent of casino meeting and exhibition space, according to the commission. Commissioners <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON> and <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Waters </PERSON> said the restrictions amounted to meddling into <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>'s affairs, which they said could inhibit further investment in the resort city. `` We want <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> to develop but we're stifling the potential,'' <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> did not attend the meeting. His brother <PERSON> Robert </PERSON>, executive vice president of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trump </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, said he was `` delighted'' by the vote and did not object to the conditions. <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> plans to keep the hotel open and more than 600 employees working while refurbishing begins. <PERSON> Elsinore </PERSON> had warned its increasingly bleak finances threatened to close the hotel in coming days. The commission this spring denied Atlantis' owners a new license, citing <PERSON> Elsinore </PERSON>'s chronic and worsening debt. It was the first time a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> casino lost a bid for relicensing since casino gambling was established more than a decade ago. <PERSON> Elsinore </PERSON> and <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> struck a deal in April shortly before the license expired and a state-appointed conservator was to take title. <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> then announced plans to end gambling at the boardwalk property and remake it into a luxury hotel. Conservator <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Nolan </PERSON> and a lawyer for the gaming division had said they suspected <PERSON> Elsinore </PERSON> ignored offers from others who would revive the gaming hall to the benefit of casino competition. Approval of the Trump sale came at the end of a three-day hearing. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, the conservator's lawyer, argued the Trump deal would harm competition in <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and give the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> developer a dangerous level of control over the state's gaming industry. `` The minute this organization does something to increase or decrease prices, the competition is going to have to fall into line or face going out of business,'' <PERSON> White </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> representatives denied the accusation, saying <PERSON> Trump </PERSON>'s holdings are not large enough to give him unusual influence in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> gaming

 <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Grand </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Metropolitan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, owner of <PERSON> Burger </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, has been mentioned in a British press report as having a possible interest in buying <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s largest hamburger chain, Wimpy International. Wimpy owner <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Biscuits </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday it is negotiating with several companies to sell its restaurant division, which also includes 284 Pizzaland and Perfect Pizza restaurants. Thursday's <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> listed Grand Met as one of several <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> restaurant companies that might have an interest in buying the business Grand Met declined to comment.

The <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> said the two other companies most often mentioned in the British press as potential buyers are <ORGANIZATION> Whitbread </ORGANIZATION> and Co.. <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>, a major brewer, and Allied Restaurants Grand Met acquired Burger King in January when it bought Minneapolis-based <ORGANIZATION> Pillsbury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> for $ 5.7 billion.

<HEAD>Cracks Found on 737-400 Engines, British Say</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Cracks have been found on the engines of new <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> 737-400 jets operating in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> said Friday. <ORGANIZATION> CAA </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Noon </PERSON> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> said she did n't know the size of the cracks, their precise location or which airlines operated the planes with engine cracks. But she said the cracks were not found on planes involved in incidents last weekend in which fan blades broke and severe vibration occurred, prompting the <ORGANIZATION> CAA </ORGANIZATION> to ground 12 737-400s in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. The planes, built at <LOCATION> Renton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> suburb, had been in commercial service since October. The Times of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> on Friday reported that the cracks in engines of grounded 737-400s were more serious than the breaking of fan blades in two engines, which occurred during two flights last week. It said the new cracks were found on previously untested engines. Officials at the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s aircraft engine plant in suburban <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> said Friday they could not confirm the newspaper report. <ORGANIZATION> GE </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> said he had no other information about the newspaper report. `` Our people are continuing to look very closely at this situation,'' he said. `` To this point, it's just premature to come to any conclusion.'' <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Gamble </PERSON>, spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commercial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airplanes </ORGANIZATION>, said the Seattle-based company could not confirm or deny the report either. `` We know of some cracking found in suspect engines sent to <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> for repair, but we ca n't confirm it,'' he said Friday. The <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> newspaper said detailed reports on the cracks have been sent to the French manufacturer, <ORGANIZATION> SNECMA </ORGANIZATION>, which makes the engines in conjunction with <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> under the joint name <ORGANIZATION> CFM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>. On Monday, the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> grounded the 12 British-operated <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737-400 aircraft powered by CFM56-3C engines. Two of those engines have been taken to the <ORGANIZATION> SNECMA </ORGANIZATION> factory near <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> and stripped down for inspection, <PERSON> Noonan </PERSON> said. In the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commercial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airplanes </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> CFM </ORGANIZATION> recommended Tuesday that 737-400s with the -3 C engines, and some other engines that had been operated at high thrust levels, be grounded for engine modifications The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> followed with its own grounding order Wednesday. The five <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> planes with affected engines, all operated by <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION>, were back in service Thursday, <PERSON> Gamble </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> USAir </ORGANIZATION> exchanged the planes' engines for ones with lesser maximum thrust, he said. The other 28 affected 737-400s are all operated by airlines outside the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. In the British incidents, a <LOCATION> Dan-Air </LOCATION> 737-400 returned to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Gatwick </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> and a <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Midlands </LOCATION> 737-400 made an emergency landing at <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Midlands </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> after engine vibrations Both airlines said the turbofan blades had been damaged. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> planes have had other crack-related problems, but not with engines. Instead, the cracks have occurred in fuselages and have been blamed on metal fatigue and other problems of aging jets.

<HEAD>Regents Ban Channel One From New York Classrooms</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BAUDER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>ALBANY, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regents </ORGANIZATION> on Friday unanimously banned the Channel One news service containing commercials from being beamed into the state's high schools. The regents rejected <ORGANIZATION> Whittle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION>' program, saying they were worried the `` active commercialization'' of the programs would send the wrong message to high school students. `` It's a very tempting package that has a flaw,'' said state Education Commissioner <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Sobol </PERSON> in opposing the plan. `` That flaw is that it's wrong. It's wrong legally, educationally, financially and morally.'' Some regents also expressed anger with Whittle's aggressive lobbying in support of Channel One. The decision is a blow to the Tennessee-based Whittle, which has said it wants to sign up 40 percent of the nation's 20,000 high schools. Earlier this month, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> officials threatened their schools with a loss of funding if they signed contracts with <PERSON> Whittle </PERSON>. That means Whittle has been rejected in the nation's two largest states. <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> <PERSON> Eshbaugh </PERSON>, a Whittle executive, said she was disappointed with the decision by the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> board, but said Channel One would be able to survive the rejection. `` We certainly would regret if this action means the students of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state would not have the opportunity to participate in the program we are offering,'' <PERSON> Eshbaugh </PERSON> said. Whittle had taken its case to the public in the days leading to Friday morning's board meeting. The company ran two full-page advertisements in <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON> said some Regents were bombarded by `` junk fax'' messages in support of <LOCATION> Whittle </LOCATION>. In return for an agreement to show the daily programs, <PERSON> Whittle </PERSON> had offered to wire high schools with complete closed circuit television systems, including satellite dishes, televisions and videocassette recorders. The most controversial aspect of its daily 12-minute news program was trhat it contained two minutes of commercials for candy, jeans, acne cream and other products aimed at teen-agers. <PERSON> Sobol </PERSON> said he's not sure it's good for society that while many parochial school students pause for a moment of prayer in the morning, public high school students were being asked by Whittle to stop for two minutes of commercials. `` What it says to children is we do n't care much about you,'' <PERSON> Sobol </PERSON> said, `` but we care what we can get out of you.'' Several regents said they worried the commercials could cause poor students who could n't afford items advertised to feel inadequate. They also said the program seems geared to suburban, white students instead of the more troubled city schools that are in dire need of the technology Whittle could provide. But <PERSON> Eshbaugh </PERSON> noted that schools contain many other forms of advertising, such as wall posters, advertisements in yearbooks and magazines and brand names emblazoned on the clothing students wear. `` Commercialization is there,'' she said. `` However any of us might not like it there, it's there to stay.'' The regents said the discussion with <PERSON> Whittle </PERSON> has caused them to examine the extent of other advertising in school. The Education Department will also look into other ways of getting more technology and television programs into school, <PERSON> Sobol </PERSON> said. Some education officials also criticized the quality of Whittle's news program <PERSON> Sobol </PERSON> said if the state government tried to produce a daily news program for distribution ~ ~ ~

 <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>'s trade minister expressed confidence Friday that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> will honor its vow to protect the freewheeling British colony's capitalist system after the 1997 takeover, despite new anxiety raised by the bloody political repression in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. `` The situation in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> must have raised doubts as to whether the Sino-British agreement on the future of <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> will be fully and faithfully implemented,'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Chan </PERSON>, secretary for trade and industry, told the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> U.S.-China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Hong </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kong </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> in a speech. `` It is important not to lose heart, not to be defeatist,'' he said. `` If anything, the tragic events in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> have served to accentuate the importance of the Joint Declaration to <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, not detract from it.'' <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> will become part of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> in 1997 under a Chinese-British declaration signed in 1984. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has pledged to maintain <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>'s way of life for 50 years after the takeover under what <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON> has called the principle of `` one country, two systems.'' Speaking to reporters before the speech, <PERSON> Chan </PERSON> said he was confident <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> would abide by the agreement because it has an excellent record for honoring international commitments. `` What gives the agreement its teeth is that it's a binding agreement,'' he said. <PERSON> Chan </PERSON>, senior <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong-Chinese </LOCATION> member of the British colonial government, was in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for an official visit scheduled prior to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s June 3-4 military crackdown on pro-democracy protesters in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. The crackdown jolted <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>'s stability, led to a surge in emigration requests and raised new questions about the colony's future under Chinese rule It has been the major topic in Chan's talks with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials and business executives during his visit
