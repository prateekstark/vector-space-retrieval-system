 While the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> suffered through record drought and heat, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> slogged through its wettest July in 52 years. Soaked by downpours and chilled in sub-normal temperatures, tourists spent vacations in raincoats. Homeowners struggled to keep up with the backyard jungle growth. And rain forced the postponement of the men's tennis finals at <LOCATION> Wimbledon </LOCATION> and the last day of the British Open golf championship. <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> had the worst of the downpours. Average rainfall there was the heaviest since modern records began, well over a century ago in 1869, the nation's <ORGANIZATION> Meteorological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> said Sunday. Fort <PERSON> William </PERSON> in the Highlands had 12 inches. <LOCATION> Glasgow </LOCATION> was only half as wet, with 6 inches. <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wales </LOCATION> had the wettest July since 1936, the office said.

 Former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> was `` vastly improved'' and giving the thumbs-up sign to her hospital nurse Sunday following a near-drowning in her swimming pool. `` She's in good spirits now because she knows she's going to get well,'' said Dr. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Deaton </PERSON>, a lung specialist treating Ms. <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON>. `` She's emotional about that and a little bit teary-eyed some of the time, knowing what she's been through and how close she came to a real catastrophic event. But she still also has her jovial personality. She was joking a little bit this morning,'' <PERSON> Deaton </PERSON> said. `` She is vastly improved.'' Ms. <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON>'s condition was upgraded from critical to serious but stable, and she continued to improve Sunday night. `` She started her liquid diet tonight. She is breathing on her own. She is receiving supplemental oxygen, though,'' hospital spokeswoman <PERSON> Kari </PERSON> <PERSON> Larsen </PERSON> said. Ms. <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON>, 52, who gained national attention during the <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> impeachment hearings, was flown by emergency helicopter to <LOCATION> Brackenridge </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> on Saturday after she was found floating face-down in her pool. <PERSON> Deaton </PERSON> said she came within `` four to five minutes, 10 minutes at most'' of suffering severe brain damage and possibly death. Ms. <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> apparently lost consciousness while in the pool. <PERSON> Deaton </PERSON> and Dr. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Little </PERSON>, a neurologist, said it is n't known what caused her to lose consciousness, but that the lack of oxygen then caused cardiac arrest. Ms. <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> had been in critical condition in the hospital's intensive care unit, but <PERSON> Deaton </PERSON> said Sunday afternoon that `` she's upgraded She's certainly stable, in a much less serious condition.'' Ms. <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> was breathing without the aid of a mechanical ventilator, responding to questions and trying to make sure a Monday dental appointment was canceled. `` She obviously has pretty good mental recall if that's her biggest concern,'' <PERSON> Deaton </PERSON> said. `` Right now, I think things look very good that she'll get totally back to normal,'' <PERSON> Little </PERSON> said. `` She's very close to normal right now. I think she will continue to improve. As best as I can tell right now, she probably will regain full mental functions.'' The doctors said Ms. <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON>, who has used a wheelchair for several years, suffers from multiple sclerosis but her condition should n't have had an effect on the incident. `` She has muscle weakness and it would be difficult for her to rescue herself from the swimming pool if she had any warning of any event. ... I doubt, though, based on the suddenness of the event, that she had any warning,'' <PERSON> Deaton </PERSON> said. Little said possible causes for her losing consciousness were a sudden heartbeat irregularity or a seizure. But hospital tests showed `` her cardiac status has been very stable. She's had no evidence of seizure activity,'' he said. Ms. <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> delivered a nominating speech for vice presidential candidate Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> at the Democratic National Convention in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> telephoned a message to Ms. <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> on Sunday, said hospital spokeswoman <PERSON> Carolyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Hinckley </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyle </PERSON>. Visitors to the hospital have included <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Treasurer <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Richards </PERSON>, who delivered the keynote address at the convention; <PERSON> Walt </PERSON> <PERSON> Rostow </PERSON>, a former aide to President <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>; <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> women's basketball Coach <PERSON> Jody </PERSON> <PERSON> Conradt </PERSON>; plus Ms. <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON>'s two sisters and live-in companion, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Earl </PERSON>, who found Ms. <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> in the pool. Ms. <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> is a fan of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lady </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Longhorns </ORGANIZATION>, and nurse <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON> said the basketball team's former star, <PERSON> Fran </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, visited before leaving for the Olympic trials. `` When I remember seeing Ms. <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> on TV, I frequently remember the thumbs-up sign that things are OK. She's probably given me that about 20 times today,'' Ms. <PERSON> Tucker </PERSON> said Ms. <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> in 1966 became the first black state senator in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> history. In 1972, she was the first Southern black elected to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> since Reconstruction, serving until 1978, when she left politics after three terms in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> to teach at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION>.

 Former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> remained in critical condition early Sunday after she was found floating unconscious in her swimming pool, authorities said. `` She's been awake off and on through the night, but she goes right to sleep,'' said <PERSON> Sheryln </PERSON> <PERSON> Gembol </PERSON>, a nursing supervisor at <LOCATION> Brackenridge </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>. `` We're trying to let her rest. `` They're going to be running some more tests throughout the day today. They know it was not a heart attack or a stroke, but as far as what made her unconscious in the pool, they're not sure,'' she added. Ms. <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON>, who rose to fame during the Watergate impeachment hearings, was found in the pool about noon Saturday by a woman who lives with her. Ms. <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON>, 52, was taken to the hospital by helicopter. Paramedics `` said she had a pulse, was trying to breathe and they were able to help her breathe en route to hospital,'' said hospital spokeswoman <PERSON> Carolyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyle </PERSON>. At a briefing late Saturday, a doctor said Ms. <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> was being treated for fluid in her lungs but showed no signs of heart or brain dysfunction. `` She has full recovery of her intellectual functions. Her vital signs are much better,'' Dr. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Deaton </PERSON> said. Though she remained in critical condition, `` the capital ` c' is not so big as when she got here.'' `` She has to heal her own lungs, which she will hopefully do,'' added <PERSON> Deaton </PERSON>, a lung specialist. He said Ms. <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> apparently lost consciousness while swimming alone in the pool, for unknown reasons. A lack of oxygen then caused the cardiac arrest, he said. Ms. <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> has had medical problems for several years and has used a wheelchair to get to her job on the faculty of the <ORGANIZATION> Lyndon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> B. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Johnson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> has refused to discuss the illness, calling it `` a mobility problem'' and denying it was <PERSON> Lou </PERSON> <PERSON> Gehrig </PERSON>'s disease or bone cancer. <PERSON> Deaton </PERSON> described it as a progressive loss of `` nerve function in her lower extremities'' similar to multiple sclerosis. In 1966, Ms. <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> became the first black state senator in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. In 1972, she was the first Southern black elected to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> since Reconstruction.

 A senior Iranian envoy indicated that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> would stop attacking commercial ships in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> while his country and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> try to negotiate a cease-fire in their 8-year-old war. The envoy, Deputy Foreign Minister <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> <PERSON> Besharati </PERSON>, also said he expected <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> protection of Kuwaiti tankers to end soon, and that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> is ready to use its influence for the release of foreign hostages held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Besharati </PERSON> is on a tour of the Arab Persian Gulf nations to assure them of <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>'s intention to abide by a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> resolution calling for a cease-fire.

He also said he believed the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would stop providing naval escort for Kuwaiti tankers in the gulf. The tankers have been flying the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> flag for one year to qualify for protection against Iranian attacks.

 Three bombs exploded Sunday in the northern province of <LOCATION> Alto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Adige </LOCATION>, injuring one person and damaging about 30 cars, police said. Authorities blamed the blasts on German-speaking extremists seeking autonomy for the province. Thirteen bombs attributed to the extremists have gone off since March, but none have caused deaths or serious injuries. Police said one bomb exploded in a garbage bin in the city of <LOCATION> Bolzano </LOCATION> at about 4:30 a.m., injuring a 65-year-old man who was cut by flying glass. Windows and cars were also damaged, they said. At about the same time, two bombs exploded at a hydroelectric plant in <LOCATION> Ponte </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gardena </LOCATION>, about 10 miles north of <LOCATION> Bolzano </LOCATION>. One of the plant's three power transformers was heavily damaged by one explosion and a resulting fire, police said. State-owned RAI television said about $ 750,000 in damage was done to the plant owned by <PERSON> Selm </PERSON>, a subsidiary of the chemical company <ORGANIZATION> Montedison </ORGANIZATION>. A second bomb exploded in a field about 100 yards from the houses of eight Italian-speaking plant workers, but caused no serious damage. On the plant's gates, investigators found an envelope on which was scrawled in German `` <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tyrol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Combat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>,'' a name left at other bomb sites. German inhabitants refer to the province as <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tyrol </LOCATION>. The Alto Adige province was stripped from <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> after World War I. The 300,000 ethnic German-speakers are a majority and have demanded priority in government jobs and more control over local broadcasting. Extremists want an independent Tyrolian state. After a terrorism campaign in the 1960s, the Italian government made the province officially bilingual.

<TEXT>
 Complaints from the humane society prompted a radio station to change the rules in a scavenger hunt in which contestants were to bring in kittens as a tie-breaker for the $ 1,000 prize. Participants deadlocked at the end of the regular contest would have received one point for every kitten they took to a shopping mall. <PERSON> Rhonda </PERSON> <PERSON> Poe </PERSON>, who operates the <ORGANIZATION> Selma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Humane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, said she was concerned for the safety of any kitten being used in the contest. `` We've been getting calls all day from people who want kittens, but we're afraid they only want them to win some money and will get rid of them when the contest is over,'' she said. <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Davies </PERSON>, operations manager at WTUN-FM, said using kittens as a tie-breaker `` seemed like a cute idea.'' But the station decided against it `` after being told they might not be treated properly.'' Instead of collecting kittens, <PERSON> Davies </PERSON> said the names of two contestants with the same number of points were drawn Saturday to decide the winner.

 A dozen wheelchair users demonstrated outside a <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> theater screening a new horror film, `` Monkey Shines,'' which the activists claim portrays the disabled as bitter, evil murderers. `` We're tired of the wheelchair school of horror in <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Bolte </PERSON>, founder of ADAPT-Cal, a disabled rights group that organized the protest Saturday. `` It was filled with inaccuracies and out-and-out lies about handicapped people,'' said <PERSON> Bolte </PERSON>, 57, a quadriplegic who was afflicted with polio as a child and has been in a wheelchair for the last 12 years. `` Monkey Shines,'' an <ORGANIZATION> Orion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pictures </ORGANIZATION> production which opened Friday, is about a quadriplegic who uses a monkey trained to help severely disabled people to murder his ex-girlfriend, his doctor, his mother, his best friend and his nurse. `` The central insult is that it's another picture showing disabled people as `` bitter, angry cripples and murderers,'' <PERSON> Bolte </PERSON> said. Twelve protestors in wheelchairs carried signs and demonstrated for three hours in front of the <ORGANIZATION> Hollywood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Theater </ORGANIZATION>, trying to persuade moviegoers to boycott the film.

<HEAD>Summary of Week's Economic Indicators</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-Inflation Fears, Bjt</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 The economic news last week was mostly positive. But the word on inflation was worrying to many. Here is a brief recap:
</TEXT>
<HEAD>GNP</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 In the second quarter, the gross national product expanded at a 3.1 percent annual pace, down slightly from a revised 3.4 percent in the first three months of the year.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>INFLATION</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 Inflation, as measured by a price index tied to the GNP, climbed at a 4.7 percent annual pace in the second quarter, the biggest advance since 1982. The index rose at a 3.5 percent rate in the first quarter.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>CONSUMER SPENDING</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 Consumer spending in June rose a seasonally adjusted 1.0 percent to $ 3.21 trillion, following a 0.6 percent increase in May. It was the biggest increase since spending shot up 1.3 percent last August.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>PERSONAL INCOME AND SAVINGS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 Americans' personal income jumped 0.7 percent in June, the best showing in three months. The $ 27.9 billion increase to $ 4.04 trillion followed a 0.5 percent rise in May. The personal savings rate fell to 4.3 percent, compared with 4.4 percent in May. The average savings rate for the first half of 1988, 4.1 percent, is up substantially from 3.2 percent in 1987.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>IMPORT PRICES</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 Import prices rose 2.7 percent in the April-June quarter, the biggest increase in more than a year. The climb followed a 1.2 percent increase in the January-March period and was the steepest since the 4.1 percent jump in the first three months of 1987.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>WAGE INCREASES</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 Major collective bargaining settlements in private industry during the first six months of this year provided for wage increases averaging 2.2 percent a year. This was a slight decline from the 2.9 percent average wage increases in the contracts when they were negotiated two to three years ago.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>FACTORY ORDERS</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 Factory orders for durable goods advanced 8.8 percent in June, their fastest pace in 30 months. Orders totaled $ 125.23 billion, $ 10.14 billion higher than the May total.

</TEXT>
<HEAD>FOREIGN INVESTMENT</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 Foreign investment in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has jumped by more than 215 percent since 1980, while American investment abroad increased by only one-fifth that rate, said a study by the <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leadership </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. The study said the pace is expected to accelerate, with foreign buyouts in 1988 expected to make up as much as 20 percent of all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> acquisitions, up from 5 percent in 1987. But the report said foreign investments still account for only 5 percent to 6 percent of total <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> assets.
</TEXT>
<HEAD>STOCK MARKET</HEAD>
<TEXT>
 The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials climbed 67.74 points during the week, finishing with a 46.40-point rise Friday. Analysts attributed the advance to fresh strength in the dollar and favorable reaction to indications by Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> has not changed credit policy recently.

 Eleven more people died Sunday from diseases blamed on flooding in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>, health authorities said. The deaths brought to 212 the number of residents killed by cholera and gastroenteritis in the Indian capital since the beginning of July, when heavy monsoon rains hit <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>. Officials blamed the diseases on flood waters that have washed through sewage and uncollected garbage and infiltrated drinking water. Hospitals admitted at least 231 people suffering from the diseases Sunday, including 38 people with cholera, raising to 624 the number of reported cholera cases in this city of 8 million, health officials said. More than 16,000 patients have sought treatment for the two diseases in July, according to official figures. The areas hardest-hit by the epidemic are slums, where garbage has not been collected for months because of a dispute over which municipal agencies are responsible.

Police said the explosion occurred at 3:30 a.m. in the second-floor offices of the Globe. No one was in the offices at the time. About 30 people were evacuated as the fire began spreading to apartments in the seven-story building, and a firefighter was injured, police said. The firefighter's condition was not immediately known. `` The door was forced open, a bomb was place in the newsroom, the doors and windows were blown out,'' an unidentified <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION> employee was quoted as saying by Agence France-Presse, the French news agency. `` All the archives, the new layout, were destroyed.'' In a telegram to <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION> employees, Culture and Communications Minister <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Lang </PERSON> called the blast an `` act of barbarism and hate.'' `` Liberty of expression ... will be firmly protected by the government,'' the telegram said.

After a pause for effect, he gunned his dirt bike for the takeoff. <PERSON> Knievel </PERSON> guessed that he was going about 75 mph when he hit the ramp. `` Usually you know about halfway across whether you're going to make it or not, and about then I knew I was going to be all right,'' he said. `` But I thought I was getting back too far, and I did n't want to flip over. That's why I only let go for a little bit.'' <PERSON> Evel </PERSON> <PERSON> Knievel </PERSON>, who suffered a total of 35 broken bones during his daredevil career, said he had never cleared more than 21 cars during his career.

The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, mindful of how voters' perceptions will affect the presidential race, insists there are no signs that inflation is becoming a problem. But many private economists disagree. These economists contend that the 68-month economic expansion, now the second longest of the post-World War II period, has used up all of the economy's slack capacity. Tight labor markets and high factory operating rates are beginning to be translated into accelerating wage demands and higher prices, they believe. Proponents of this theory received more ammunition last week with two new government reports, one on wage increases and the other on overall economic growth and inflation. The wage report showed that compensation for American workers, wages and fringe benefits such as health insurance and pensions, was rising this year at the highest rate since the summer of 1985. Wages and benefits, which represent about two-thirds of all business costs, climbed by 4.5 percent in the 12-month period ending in June, compared with an increase of just 3 percent in the prior 12 months. In a second report, the government said an inflation index tied to the gross national product shot up at an annual rate of 4.7 percent from April through June, the fastest pace in almost six years. The big jump in prices was blamed on higher consumer costs for food, clothing and energy. To the administration, these reports were not cause for concern. <PERSON> Beryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Sprinkel </PERSON>, the president's chief economic adviser, blamed the inflation spurt on temporary factors, including the drought and higher import costs because of the weaker dollar. He insisted that there was no evidence that the economy was being overtaken by a new wage-price spiral. `` We remain convinced that inflation will continue under restraint,'' he told reporters during a briefing. Some private economists agree, contending that inflationary pressures from the drought and tight labor markets are being offset by weakness in oil prices and a rebound in the dollar, which reduces the costs of imports. They note that the consumer price index, after registering big jumps in the early spring, calmed down in May and June only 0.3 percent. During the first six months of the year, consumer prices rose 4.4 percent, identical to the inflation rate for all of 1987. `` I do n't think we are seeing signs of higher inflation ahead,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, head of a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> consulting firm. `` The rise in energy and clothing prices in the spring has since been reversed.'' But this view is disputed by other private analysts, who argue that inflation has once again become a threat for the first time since the early 1980s, when the fight to reduce double-digit inflation rates led to the steep 1981-82 recession. `` The pickup in inflation is worrisome and is likely to continue through the end of the year, raising the possibility of a slowdown in growth in 1989,'' said <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Jasinowski </PERSON>, chief economist of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION>. Other analysts raise the possibility of an outright recession beginning next year. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> since March has been taking a series of steps to push interest rates higher in an effort to ease inflationary pressures by dampening demand. While this is the classic recipe for starting a recession, <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> has maintained that a downturn can be avoided if the central bank acts quickly at the first sign of inflation, when the amount of credit restraint needed is still small. But <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyss </PERSON>, an economist with <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> may have already waited too long. `` The pattern is that the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> always waits too long to act, then it clamps down too hard and causes a recession,'' he said. <PERSON> Wyss </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> has been hesitant about moving too quickly because this is a presidential election year and big interest-rate boosts would not be viewed favorably by the administration in its efforts to keep the White House in Republican hands. As a result, <PERSON> Wyss </PERSON> predicted that consumer prices would rise at around 5.5 percent annual rate next year, which would be the fastest inflation clip since an 8.9 percent rise in 1981. <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinai </PERSON>, chief economist of the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said one of the problems is that demand pressures are outstripping the country's ability to produce the goods and services `` We are starting to see a situation where we have too many dollars chasing too few goods,'' he said. `` Once the economy runs out of slack, we often get a credit crunch, which ultimately leads to a recession.''

 Astronauts on the first post-Challenger shuttle flight may grow crystals of a protein taken from the AIDS virus in an experiment researchers hope will lead to drugs to fight the fatal disease. The protein, reverse transcriptase, is an enzyme the AIDS virus uses to replicate its genetic material in order to reproduce and spread through the body, said Dr. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Bugg </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alabama-Birmingham </ORGANIZATION> researcher. `` AIDS would never infect human cells without using this enzyme,'' said <PERSON> Bugg </PERSON>, coordinator for <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> of protein experiments that are to be conducted aboard Discovery. The shuttle is scheduled to fly later this year. Researchers want to grow the crystals of reverse transcriptase to decipher its structure. Crystals grown in space are not distorted by gravity while they form. Scientists hope to learn how the AIDS virus takes over the genetic machinery inside a cell and use that knowledge to develop a drug to conquer AIDS. Dr. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Krenitsky </PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION> Burroughs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wellcome </ORGANIZATION> in Research Triangle Park, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, developed the experiment. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> is making sure it meets safety guidelines. `` We want to make sure there is no danger of infection to the crew with just this protein,'' <PERSON> Bugg </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Ball </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said the review would take several weeks. <PERSON> Krenitsky </PERSON> predicted that if the shuttle is launched in September and the experiment works well, researchers could have a model of the protein's structure by the end of the year. But he cautioned it could take 10 years to make a new AIDS drug. `` It's still very much an experimental program, but one that we feel is full of promise,'' he said. Discovery is in the middle of a simulated countdown leading up to a crucial test-firing of its main engines to test modifications. The countdown was interrupted Friday because of problems with ground fueling equipment, and the firing was postponed from Monday until Thursday. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> officials so far have found no evidence to suggest the experiment could infect any of the astronauts with AIDS. <PERSON> Krenitsky </PERSON> said Thursday that it even if the protein somehow got into an astronaut's bloodstream it would not infect him. `` First of all, you only have one of 20 to 30 proteins the virus needs to be a viable organism,'' <PERSON> Krenitsky </PERSON> said. `` It's such a small piece, it's not workable.''

 Behind the arguments about various child-care proposals, the real winners are working mothers whose problems are getting unprecedented attention on the presidential campaign trail and on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>. Although there's no certainty that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will enact such legislation this year, given the little time left on the election-year legislative calendar, both Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> have latched onto the issue. Passage of legislation more comprehensive than the current patchwork of federal child-care policies, therefore, seems inevitable. <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> Blank </PERSON>, director of child care at the Children's Defense Fund, says she could n't be more pleased. `` The landscape is changing, both demographically and politically,'' she said. `` Families need child care. They've waited a long time to turn any attention to this issue. Clearly both candidates have an interest ... and both candidates understand -LRB- the need for -RRB- new, significant resources.'' In fact, both <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> visited day-care centers last week. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the Democratic presidential nominee, and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, his certain Republican opponent, favor rival child-care approaches, so the issue is sure to remain in public view as the general election campaign unfolds. The day-care visits seemed tacit recognition by the two men of a new American social norm documented recently by the <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>: More than half of new mothers go back to work before their children are a year old. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is proposing a $ 2.2 billion program of tax credits for working parents, while <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is backing a $ 2.5 billion child-care bill in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The obvious concern displayed by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, plus the surprisingly high dollar commitment in <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposal, are fueling optimism that a comprehensive child-care bill may be enacted this year. `` Apparently we're not arguing money anymore,'' an ebullient Sen. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Conn </LOCATION>., said after <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> made his proposal `` We're all agreed we've got to do something about child care. We're all agreed that it's going to cost a lot of money,'' <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON> said. The Connecticut Democrat is chief sponsor of the $ 2.5 billion Act for <ORGANIZATION> Better </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Child </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Care </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has endorsed the Democratic initiative in principle. The legislation won <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committee approval last week and is tentatively scheduled for action this week in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. The bill reserves 75 percent of its money to help low - and middle-income parents pay for day care at homes and centers that meet minimum federal safety and staffing standards States could use the rest of the money for capital improvements, day-care staff training and salaries and administrative costs. The approach differs substantially from the one that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has proposed. The vice president's day-care program would be built around a tax credit of up to $ 1,000 for low-income families for each child under 4 _ even if one parent in the family was staying home to take care of the child. The largest existing government program is the dependent-care tax credit for dual-earner families who pay for child care. It costs the Department of the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> about $ 4 billion a year in lost revenue. According to <PERSON> Blank </PERSON>, other government child-care programs include a $ 2.7 billion social services block grant to states, of which less than 20 percent is used for day care, and a $ 600 million food program that helps day-care homes and centers provide nutritious meals. Welfare parents in job training programs or jobs that do n't pay enough for them to leave the rolls are also entitled to some help with child-care expenses. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> bill, endorsed in general terms by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, would depart from current policy by giving tax breaks to families with a spouse at home _ families not eligible for the existing dependent care tax credit. At least four Republican-sponsored bills pending in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> take the same approach. Conservatives support it as a way to eliminate what they see as tax discrimination against mothers who decide to stay home with their children. But Citizens for <ORGANIZATION> Tax </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION>, a labor-backed tax study group, said the bills are unfair and unlikely to help those most in need, since low-income families can least afford to have one parent stay at home. Backers of the Democratic initiative say a universal tax break for families with preschool children is no substitute for their bill. They argue that a $ 1,000 tax credit would pay for only a third of the cost of one child's annual day care, and after the fact. They say a simple tax credit does not address the uneven quality of day care. Conservatives criticize the Democrats' bill on two major points _ its cost and the federal day-care standards it sets. But <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s plan and a recent House GOP initiative with a $ 1.3 billion price tag may blunt the controversy over spending That leaves federal standards for child-care as the primary sticking point. Sen. <PERSON> Strom </PERSON> <PERSON> Thurmond </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-S.C. </LOCATION>, summing up the conservative view during committee discussion of the Democratic bill, said, `` It has not been established in my mind that state and local governments ... need to be guided by the superior wisdom from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON> and Children's Defense Fund officials say national standards are critical. `` This is a linchpin'' of <PERSON> Dodd </PERSON>'s bill, <PERSON> Blank </PERSON> said. `` Clearly this is not a regional issue,'' she said. `` Infants have the same needs no matter what state they're located in. A child care-giver with no training has no training no matter where she resides.''

<HEAD>Resignation of Mafia Investigator Causes Crisis In Confidence</HEAD>

<DATELINE>ROME (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The resignation of <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s top investigator of the Mafia has shaken public confidence in the government's battle with the mob and prompted fears about a new wave of corruption in <LOCATION> Sicily </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Giovanni </PERSON> <PERSON> Falcone </PERSON> and eight other investigating magistrates, who played a prominent role in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s largest Mafia trial, resigned Saturday. The so-called maxi-trial ended in December with convictions of 338 Mafiosi, including 19 reputed members of the <ORGANIZATION> Cosa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nostra </ORGANIZATION>'s leadership commission. The nine magistrates of the `` anti-Mafia pool'' in <LOCATION> Sicily </LOCATION> submitted their resignations to the <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Magistrates </ORGANIZATION>, which oversees Italian judges, and asked to be transferred to other posts. <PERSON> Falcone </PERSON> gave several reasons for the action, including what he called obstruction of Mafia investigations on the island of <LOCATION> Sicily </LOCATION>. In a letter to the council, <PERSON> Falcone </PERSON> cited `` ommissions and inertia'' in the fight against organized crime. `` That which I feared could happen unfortunately happened. The investigations into the Mafia have been obstructed and -LRB- the anti-Mafia pool -RRB- ... is now stalled.'' <PERSON> Falcone </PERSON> also said in the letter that he wanted to leave his job so he could testify freely before a <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> inquiry into Mafia investigations. The Council of Magistrates has been holding an inquiry into statements by the prosecutor of the Sicilian city of <LOCATION> Marsala </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Paolo </PERSON> <PERSON> Borsellino </PERSON>, that state and local officials curbed the power of the anti-Mafia group. <PERSON> Palermo </PERSON>'s mayor said <PERSON> Falcone </PERSON>'s resignation could mark a return to the days when Sicilian authorities and politicians conspired with the mob. `` We have weeded out corrupt politicians, or those who were in some way accomplices of the Mafia,'' the mayor, <PERSON> Leoluca </PERSON> <PERSON> Orlando </PERSON>, said in an interview with the state-run <ORGANIZATION> RAI </ORGANIZATION> television Saturday night. `` Today,'' he said, `` we are worried that there can be a return to the past, a return to the years in which magistrates, policemen and politicians were in collusion with the Mafia. I would n't want to return to the past.'' Ten days ago, <PERSON> Borsellino </PERSON> caused a national uproar when he charged that authorities had gone soft on the Mafia since the `` maxi-trial'' and that state and local officials had curbed the power of the magistrates. The charges prompted President <PERSON> Francesco </PERSON> <PERSON> Cossiga </PERSON> to dispatch national police officials to <LOCATION> Palermo </LOCATION> to examine the situation. He also ordered the inquiry by the national judges' council in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>. In his letter to the council, <PERSON> Falcone </PERSON> also said his methods `` differ radically'' with those of his new superior, <PERSON> Antonino </PERSON> <PERSON> Meli </PERSON>. <PERSON> Meli </PERSON> was appointed overseeing magistrate in February despite objections by <PERSON> Falcone </PERSON> that he had no experience in Mafia probes. <PERSON> Falcone </PERSON> said his resignation should be seen as `` the profound unease of one who must perform a delicate job in unfavorable conditions and the desire to express freely my thoughts without any conditions.'' The anti-Mafia pool was put together in 1983, after an investigator was killed in <LOCATION> Palermo </LOCATION>. The team worked under heavy security and devoted attention to fighting the Mafia. The magistrates were the first to take advantage of new laws to examine bank accounts of anyone suspected of Mafia association. The information was used successfully in trials of suspected Mafia drug traffickers. <PERSON> Falcone </PERSON> won the cooperation of <PERSON> Tomasso </PERSON> <PERSON> Buscetta </PERSON>, a Mafia leader who broke the mob's code of silence to describe its command structure in the 1987 trial. <PERSON> Falcone </PERSON> has become a national symbol of <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s war on organized crime and is considered its top investigator of the Mafia.

 Turkish troops shot and seriously wounded a Greek Cypriot soldier Sunday in the fortified buffer zone that divides this capital city, officials said. Greek soldiers said Sgt. <PERSON> Evagoras </PERSON> <PERSON> Evagorou </PERSON>, 19, was shot in the back while crossing the 25-yard-wide zone in a quarter of the old city to talk to a Turkish guard on the other side.

 <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> eagle No. 3 looked glum. In just two hours, the baby bald eagle had been plucked from its nest in a tall spruce, lowered to the ground in a sack, put in a portable dog pen and ferried on a bouncing skiff to a <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> vessel. The bird was to become one of more than 300 bald eagles captured in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> and relocated in other states in an effort to replenish the threatened national symbol. Bald eagles, an endangered species in every other state because of lead poisoning, pollution and other man-made dangers, are abundant in southeast <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>, numbering about 12,000 at biologists' last count _ about the number in all the other states combined The region has become the stocking ground for eagle-recovery programs in five states. `` The demand for birds is getting so great the supply ca n't meet the demand, and <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>'s been a great bonanza for us,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Tennessee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, which hopes to release 60 bald eagles by 1990. Including 46 exported this year, <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> has contributed 264 bald eagles for relocation in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobson </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Juneau </LOCATION>. From 1980 to 1987, 400 eagles from <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> and elsewhere were relocated in more than a dozen states, authorities say. Sightings of birds and nests make biologists confident the program is succeeding, though they wo n't have statistical proof for a few years. An eagle expedition begins with time-consuming helicopter surveys. Fish and Wildlife workers fly over some 200 miles of coastline each spring, plotting nests. Though eagle nests often span 8 feet or more, the sticks, grass and other matter they're made of camouflage them in the rain forest Come July, biologists from other states fly in and board two 65-foot military surplus vessels run by the Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. The capture area is a half-day's cruise away in the middle of the <ORGANIZATION> Tongass </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION>. Once there, <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> conservationist <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Schutt </PERSON> and fellow tree-scaler <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> climb to the nests. While they ascend, the adult birds fly in agitated circles or perch in trees nearby, keening and trilling, and shy away from the climber and his assistants. The young birds do n't resist. `` Eagles, they're pretty docile,'' said <PERSON> Schutt </PERSON>. `` I do n't think they've -LRB- climbers -RRB- ever been struck on this project. It would be kind of unnerving to be 80 feet up a tree and struck by a bird that's 12 to 14 pounds,'' said Fish and Wildlife's <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Schempf </PERSON> Though the young eagles appear nearly full-size when they're captured at 6 to 7 weeks of age, their feathers are soft and their bodies unprepared for flight They usually begin flying at 10 to 12 weeks. They do n't gain the characteristic white head and tail feathers until they are 3 or 4 years old, and their immature plummage varies from dark brown to mottled brown and white. Caretakers band their legs for identification and dust them with flea powder to kill feather lice. Once powdered, measured and recorded, the eagles ride out the trip in relative comfort, dining twice daily on diced halibut and snapper. They quickly adapt a tidy-nest instinct in their cages, ejecting their refuse through the doors onto the deck and hapless deckhands. Once the capture quota is met, the eagles are taken to <LOCATION> Juneau </LOCATION> and the next stage of their travel aboard commercial airliners.

<HEAD>Lawmaker Pushing for Foreign Investment Disclosure</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Foreign investment in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is expected to accelerate dramatically this year, but the true scope of overseas ownership remains hidden, a congressional critic complains. `` We need to know if foreign ownership is concentrating itself in key areas of our economy _ energy, steel, banking _ whether foreign ownership is gaining control of key sectors of the American economy,'' says Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON> came into the spotlight last year as sponsor of a provision of the 1,000-page trade bill approved by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>. It would have forced a major increase in the amount of disclosure required of foreign investors. Lawmakers eventually dropped <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON>'s heavily debated plan in an unsuccessful effort to win President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s approval. And it is not part of the revised version of the trade bill now under debate. But <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON> is still pushing legislation to require foreign owners to register their major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> assets with the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, including business, industrial, real estate and farm holdings. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration opposes his bill because `` they do n't want to look like the folks that gave away the store,'' the <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> Democrat said Prospects for getting the bill to the president's desk this year are not especially bright, but <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON> vows not to give up. To bolster his case, he cites a private study released last week showing foreign ownership in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> more than tripled since 1980. The <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leadership </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> said foreign investors own about 33 percent of prime commercial real estate in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, 46 percent in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, and 39 percent in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. It said they own 10 percent of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> manufacturing base, hold a majority interest in concrete and consumer electronics industries, and a significant portion in machine tools, chemicals and auto parts. Nearly 3 million Americans are employed full or part-time as a result of foreign investment, the study said. It acknowledged, however, that foreign investments still account for no more than 5 percent to 6 percent of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> assets. <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON> said it is `` foolhardy'' to believe foreign investors will avoid the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> if they must register their holdings because `` every other country collects careful data'' without scaring off business. <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> LeaMond </PERSON>, president of the institute, said: `` In our innermost circle of trading partners, we are the only nation that swings the door open unconditionally to virtually every investment.'' Treasury Secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> and former <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> official <PERSON> Elliot </PERSON> <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> claim <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON>'s bill is anti-competitive. <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> testified before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> that it would discourage foreign investment and result in higher <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> interest rates and an economic slowdown. <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> called the reporting requirements burdensome. He said sufficient data already have been collected by 16 federal agencies and that investors would have to reveal business secrets. In its study, the institute said an `` unprecedented transfer of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> assets to foreign control is under way.'' Since 1980, foreign direct investment in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> expanded by more than 215 percent, while American investment abroad jumped by one-fifth that rate, the study said. Foreign buy-outs are expected to make up as much as 20 percent of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> acquisitions this year, up from 5 percent in 1987, said the study, which based its findings on the latest available data from the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and other sources.

 <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Blanton </PERSON>, former congressman, ex-governor and one-time inmate at a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> penitentiary, is hoping for a big sympathy vote as he bids for political resurrection in Thursday's Democratic primary for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Blanton </PERSON>, who left the governor's office in 1979 in a swirl of controversy over the sale of pardons and state liquor licenses, said he expects voters to see that he was a victim of political persecution. `` They know I was railroaded and falsely accused,'' he said. <PERSON> Blanton </PERSON> faces three primary opponents in <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>'s 8th District, a largely rural area that borders the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> and runs from just north of <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> state line. The favorite, state Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tanner </PERSON>, has the support of <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, the district's popular outgoing congressman, and has raised more than $ 450,000 to <PERSON> Blanton </PERSON>'s $ 25,000. `` I've got a million dollars worth of name recognition which I have earned over the years,'' <PERSON> Blanton </PERSON> said. `` I have n't gone out begging and have n't held any arm-twisting fund-raisers.'' <PERSON> Blanton </PERSON> won some of that recognition when he was unceremoniously dumped from the governor's office before his term expired in January 1979. Fellow Democrats swore in Republican <PERSON> Lamar </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> three days early after <PERSON> Blanton </PERSON> abruptly pardoned three former felons and commuted the sentences of 49 inmates, most of them armed robbers and murderers. The pardon scandal, in which two of <PERSON> Blanton </PERSON>'s aides were convicted of taking bribes to free prisoners, became the subject of the movie `` Marie,'' starring <PERSON> Sissy </PERSON> <PERSON> Spacek </PERSON>. <PERSON> Blanton </PERSON> was never charged in that scandal, but he was convicted in federal court in 1981 of taking part in a scheme to sell state liquor licenses. The conviction was on charges of conspiracy, extortion and mail fraud. The fraud conviction was overturned after his release from prison because of a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling on the definition of the offense. A state court restored his citizenship rights last year. <PERSON> Blanton </PERSON>, who represented the state's 7th District in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> from 1967 to 1972 and was <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>'s chief executive from 1975 to 1979, is running on a platform of government experience and fair play. `` There's a large silent vote that we still feel will come down on my side,'' he said. <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, who has represented the district without serious opposition since 1969, said he has known <PERSON> Tanner </PERSON> all his life and has followed his 12-year career in the Legislature. `` I might have retired two years ago but he was n't ready,'' <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> said from his office in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The other Democrats in the race are <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> Mayor <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Conger </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ivy </PERSON> <PERSON> Scarborough </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> lawyer. The race has produced few fireworks or sharp differences on issues. The candidates promised to help create jobs, protect the family farm, improve education and oppose drug dealers. None has seriously attacked <PERSON> Blanton </PERSON> in public for his prison record, but <PERSON> Tanner </PERSON> has been criticized as too well financed and tied to the district's political establishment. Three Republicans are running in the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> primary.

<HEAD>Newspapers Attack Government Ban On Film</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JOHANNESBURG, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Newspapers on Sunday condemned the government's ban on `` Cry Freedom'' and said the anti-apartheid film could help South Africans confront and address their deep racial divisions. The movie tells the story of black South African activist <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Biko </PERSON>, who died in police detention in 1977, and white journalist <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Woods </PERSON>, who befriended him. The film was approved by government censors Friday morning and immediately began playing in 30 theaters nationwide. However, police seized the film seven hours later, saying it was contributing to the `` revolutionary climate'' in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. `` South Africans have been reminded anew that the government wants to decide for them what they should see, think, feel,'' the independent Sunday Star said in an editorial. `` The central point about ` Cry Freedom' is ... whether South Africans are mature enough to confront a substantially accurate and thoroughly discomfiting piece of recent history,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> said. `` We think they are.'' During the film's brief run, three bombs exploded at theaters where the movie was shown and there were several bomb threats. There were no injuries. On Saturday, a bomb blast at a shopping area in a white suburb outside <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> killed one woman and injured 56. Police cited the theater attacks as proof that the controversial film was a threat to public safety. Never before has a film shown in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> contained such emotional and violent scenes related to the government's apartheid policies. By law and custom, apartheid establishes a racially segregated society in which the nation's 26 million blacks have no voice in national affairs. The country's 5 million whites control the economy and maintain separate residential areas, schools and health services. The banning `` is an act of a desperate government whose thoughts are clouded with fear and uncertainty,'' said the black-oriented City Press. `` We are dealing with certain government officials who do not have the slightest idea of the basic tenets of freedom of thought and expression.'' The independent Sunday Times, the country's largest Sunday newspaper, said the government was more worried about the film's `` considerable truth'' than its alleged anti-South <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> propaganda `` The challenge of ` Cry Freedom' for whites is to commit themselves to redressing those wrongs -LRB- of racial discrimination -RRB-,'' the Sunday Times said. `` The test for black South Africans is to rise above the bitterness ... and take up the task of constructive participation in building a better <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>,'' it added. The Sunday Times and The Sunday Star both ran front-page stories suggesting that international distributors of movies and television programs could face increased pressure to pull out of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> following the ban on `` Cry Freedom.''

 Three doctors who dub themselves the <ORGANIZATION> Bruise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> say if you've got stress, they've got the cure. Their prescription: a strong dose of rock' n' roll. `` Some people find it a little hard to believe, but once they hear us, they see that we can play,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Falcone </PERSON>, director of <ORGANIZATION> LifeFlight </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trauma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Grant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, who plays bass guitar and sings. The four-man, one-woman band includes the three doctors: a trauma surgeon, a plastic and reconstructive surgeon, and a family practitioner; and a pilot and a hospital vice president. The band belts out a nostalgic mix of 1960s British pop by the Beatles, the <ORGANIZATION> Rolling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stones </ORGANIZATION>, the Animals and the <ORGANIZATION> Yardbirds </ORGANIZATION>. The group was organized for a talent show last year, which was successful enough to encourage the band to continue. They charge $ 600 for a night's work. `` The rock' n' roll really helps to relax me,'' said <PERSON> Falcone </PERSON>, 38. `` It was something I really liked as a kid and I missed it. `` I love music, like playing in front of people and enjoy having a good time.

 Some 160,000 people had one thing on their mind _ and on their breath _ as they gathered this weekend to munch on mushrooms, burritos, ice cream and other treats liberally smothered in garlic. The 10th annual Gilroy Garlic Festival featured 85 booths of garlic-spiced foods from nearly every imaginable ethnic, national and cultural background. Arts and crafts booths featured items like 14-carat gold garlic-motif jewelry and garlic perfume. A big item was Mrs. M's garlic-peanut butter-chocolate candies. Stuffed into little cups, about 7,000 were sold last year for 75 cents each. `` We sell them like mad,'' said <PERSON> Harriett </PERSON> <PERSON> Macioge </PERSON>, alias Mrs. M. `` Some people tell me it tastes like a <PERSON> Reese </PERSON>'s Cup with a little garlic at the end, but I do n't like peanut butter, so I ca n't answer your question personally,'' she added, when asked to describe their taste Some 32,000 people attended opening day of the festival on Friday, about equal to last year's record opening-day crowd, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Parrinello </PERSON>, festival vice president.

<HEAD>Shultz Willing To Meet With Iranian Foreign Minister</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said Sunday he would be willing to meet with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s foreign minister if a meeting were requested. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, in an interview on <ORGANIZATION> CBS-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Face the Nation,'' indicated direct U.S.-Iranian talks could include discussions about an end to the Iran-Iraq war, terrorism and hostage-taking but not the return of Iranian assets, which is being handled by an international court. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials are trying to find `` an authoritative channel'' for direct talks with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> but he has not sought a meeting with Iranian Foreign Minister <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Akbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> during the Iranian official's visit to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> for peace talks. `` We do n't have to go running around after people,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said. But he added, `` It's important to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> to have a relationship with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and that will emerge in due time.'' Asked if he would meet with <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> if such a meeting were requested, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> replied, `` Sure,'' adding, `` I do n't know that it's necessarily the right way to start, to have the foreign ministers meet, but at any rate we have stated our policy.'' He indicated the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> continues to make contacts with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> through third countries and said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have repeatedly expressed a willingness to hold direct talks on `` what it takes for them to become part of the civilized community.'' He said if <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> will stop the war, stop being involved in terrorism and stop promoting the taking of hostages, then `` there is a prospect of more normal relations with us.'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said the issue of releasing nine Americans held by pro-Iranian groups in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> would have to be separate from financial and other considerations. He noted that the issue of releasing Iranian assets held by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is being handled by a claims tribunal court in The Hague and `` there is no reason to disrupt it.'' Iranian officials have suggested they might work for release of the hostages if the assets are returned, but <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration officials have said they will make no such deal. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> described the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> effort to sell arms to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in exchange for the hostages as `` an aberration'' and said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has a constant policy.

<HEAD>Rain Brings Some Relief To Indiana Farmers</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BLOOMINGTON, Ind. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The grass is green and the crops are growing again in southern <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> thanks to rain that fell during the past two weeks. The moisture has also given new life to the hopes of farmers. `` Everything was brown, and then just in a couple of days it started greening, and it looks like spring now,'' said <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON> <PERSON> Heidrick </PERSON>, who farms 750 acres in eastern <LOCATION> Owen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> with her husband, <PERSON> Ron </PERSON>. The worst drought in decades had dried out the couple's fields, but the recent rain improved chances that they will harvest enough corn and soybeans to make the loan payments on the spring planting, Mrs. <PERSON> Heidrick </PERSON> said. `` We're doing fine, you know. Things are looking better, and we just keep working,'' she said. South-central Indiana got more rain in July, most of it in the third week, than in May and June together. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION> lists July rainfall of 3.88 inches. May and June had 1.42 inches of rain. Milk production is up at <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Owen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> dairy farm, where cows have more grass to eat and his once-dry pond again has water. `` We just really do n't know where we stand right now, but it do n't look near as bleak as it did before it started raining,'' <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON> said. `` I had a lot of corn that was waist-high before the rain, and it's head-high now,'' he said. `` On my better soybeans, they grew something like a foot-and-a-half. They were about knee-high, the taller ones. Now they're up pretty near hip-high.'' <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> Hasler </PERSON>, of southern <LOCATION> Greene </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, said the outlook is much brighter now than it was three weeks ago, when her family planned to sell 20 sows and 100 baby feeder pigs because of a lack of feed corn. The rain may have saved enough corn that the cuts wo n't have to be so drastic, she said. `` The first night it rained, <PERSON> Don </PERSON> stood outside and watched it rain. He just stood out on our porch,'' <PERSON> Hasler </PERSON> said. `` We've got green grass again, and the weeds are growing, and all of that good stuff. There's lots of mudholes for the pigs to wallow in. It looks like a normal summer now.'' Despite the increased rainfall, farmers remain uncertain about how they will fare during the winter. Many face shortages of hay and corn to feed their livestock, and sharply reduced crop income. A <ORGANIZATION> Purdue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> agricultural expert says only 9 percent of <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> farmers have federal crop insurance. While the rain halted a steady decline in anticipated yields, experts do n't have enough experience with droughts to know how much it will allow crops to recover, said <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Strueh </PERSON>, assistant to <ORGANIZATION> Purdue </ORGANIZATION>'s dean of agriculture. `` There are none of us that ever experienced anything like this before,'' <PERSON> Strueh </PERSON> said last week. `` This is the worst we've ever had since we kept records,'' starting about the turn of the century.

<DATELINE>TAMPA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A woman who won $ 5 million in a lottery only to end up with her house being seized for back taxes has now been arrested and accused of plotting to kill her daughter-in-law. <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Futch </PERSON>, 64, on Saturday `` negotiated a contract with our undercover detective for $ 5,000'' to kill the wife of her youngest son, said <LOCATION> Hillsborough </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff's spokesman <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Espinosa </PERSON>. Mrs. <PERSON> Futch </PERSON> was ordered held without bond and charged with soliciting for the first-degree murder of <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Futch </PERSON>, 23. If convicted, she faces a prison term of up to 30 years. Her son, <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Futch </PERSON>, said money troubles had left his mother distraught, but he and his wife said they were still shocked. `` She was over here yesterday, laughing and drinking coffee,'' said <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Futch </PERSON>. `` We had our spats, but I would apologize to her or she would apologize to me.'' Like other members of the family, <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Futch </PERSON> said she could not believe the plot was serious and did not think her mother-in-law belonged in jail. Mrs. <PERSON> Futch </PERSON> won her jackpot in a Lotto drawing in <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, on Sept. 15, 1984, and received $ 5 million in a lump sum. She bought the ticket at the <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> airport during a vacation. With the money she bought a house to be near her son, whom family members said she doted on. News reports at the time said she once tipped a man $ 7,000 just to play pool with her son. She also gave away some money, then made bad investments in <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. And the <ORGANIZATION> Intenal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said she failed to pay any income tax in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, as the law required. The <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION>, which claims she owes $ 5 million in back taxes, interest and penalties, has seized her home and plans to auction it off Wednesday, said <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Futch </PERSON>. <PERSON> Espinosa </PERSON> declined to comment on a possible motive for the alleged contract-murder deal. Neighbor <PERSON> Patsy </PERSON> <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> said Mrs. <PERSON> Futch </PERSON> once asked her to try to break the couple up. `` The money did cause a lot of problems,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Futch </PERSON> conceded his mother was overprotective. `` She never would let me have any friends,'' he said. `` She would always chase them off whenever I'd bring one home.'' Her daughter-in-law said she was worried about Mrs. <PERSON> Futch </PERSON>, who suffers high blood pressure and heart problems. `` I do n't think jail is the place,'' said <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Futch </PERSON>. `` I think that's too hard on her.''

 Four teams of Soviet missile experts are arriving Monday night for a third round of inspections at U. S. missile sites, a spokesman for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> said Sunday.

 Soviet officials are promising to reveal one of their deepest military secrets, one that <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Minister <PERSON> Dmitri </PERSON> <PERSON> Yazoz </PERSON> says is a mystery even to him: the size of the defense budget. That military budget will again be near the top of the agenda as <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> opens his third round of talks with <PERSON> Yazov </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> on Monday. Soviet defense officials in the past said their annual spending was about 20 billion rubles, or $ 33 billion, just over one-tenth of the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> budget. But analysts at the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> say Soviet defense spending is close to that of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, accounting for 15 percent to 17 percent of the Soviet gross national product. And <PERSON> Yazov </PERSON>, during his two previous meetings with <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>, has pegged Soviet defense spending at about 16 percent of GNP, very close to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> estimate. `` We welcome that kind of truth now,'' a senior <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> official said on the eve of <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>'s departure for <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. `` But that new candor does n't substitute for the fact that they still do n't present a detailed public, accurate accounting of what their military budget really is and what it goes for,'' said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official, speaking on condition of anonymity. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which has an economy estimated at double that of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, spent 6.6 percent of GNP on defense in 1986, according to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government statistics. The Soviets say they do n't know exactly what they are spending on defense because their data does not account for weapons research, development and production, which consume more than half the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> budget. Nowhere are the Soviet numbers pulled together. And in a country where the government owns all industry, the Soviet military pays artificially low prices for goods that in many cases are not even available to civilian factories, such as special steel alloys. `` It is kind of hard for us to believe that they do n't know how much in detail they spend on military matters, but maybe it's true,'' said the senior <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> official Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has called for reforms throughout society, including the military, and wants the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> to produce a complete and reliable budget. Ultimately, he wants to improve the international climate enough to allow him to divert resources into the civilian sector. <PERSON> Vadim </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuznetsov </PERSON>, deputy director of the <LOCATION> U.S.A. </LOCATION> desk at the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, said in a recent interview in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> that his nation would make good on its pledge to publish a detailed defense budget by the early 1990s. `` In two, three or four years, we will have much more correct figures on military spending,'' said <PERSON> Kuznetsov </PERSON>. That will take a new system of accounting, similar to the one in which civilian factories must pay their way or shut down, rather than exist on state subsidies, as has been the case. `` Under the old system, a truck could cost many times less for the military than for a collective farm'' because of price manipulation, said <PERSON> Kuznetsov </PERSON>. `` When we have price reform, the new price will reflect the production costs for everybody,'' he said. `` When a truck costs as much for a collective farm as it does for the military, then we will have more accurate figures on military spending.'' But Soviet military spending will stay below that of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Kuznetsov </PERSON>, `` because we have compulsive military service. We practically pay our soldiers nothing. They get some pocket money for cigarettes, that's all.'' In the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which since 1972 has had an all-volunteer military, military salaries make up $ 78.3 billion of the annual <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> budget of $ 289.3 billion, according to <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> statistics. The new Soviet accounting method will bolster <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policy of `` glasnost,'' or greater openness in discussing previously taboo subjects. `` At public lectures, people would ask how with so few rubles in the budget, we could have military parity with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which spends $ 300 billion,'' said <PERSON> Kuznetsov </PERSON>. The financial affairs of the Soviet <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> always have been secret, reviewed only by a handful of top Kremlin leaders.

 <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>'s King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> has posed a challenge to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> and the strength of his own society by loosening <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>'s ties with <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION>. The king on Sunday appeared to rule out the idea of <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> representing Palestinians in any peace talks and said his country's links to Palestinians in the occupied territories hamper their fight against occupation Rumors swept <LOCATION> Amman </LOCATION> that further steps were possible _ perhaps replacement of <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> members of his Cabinet. <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> already dissolved the lower house of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, where 30 of the 60 members represented the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. He also canceled a major <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> development project. But overly strong measures could shake the foundations of a kingdom with a majority population of <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> refugees and immigrants tied by blood and bank accounts to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>'s moves stem from the Palestinian uprising on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, seized from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> in the 1967 Middle East War. Protesters there clearly have demonstrated the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s overwhelming popularity, and <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>'s relative lack of it The Arab summit in <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION> in June, which was called to back the uprising, placed political and financial control from the outside clearly in the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s hands, upsetting some <LOCATION> Jordanian </LOCATION> officials who argued the <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> leaders had ignored <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>'s historic responsibilities to the region. By stepping back, <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> is honoring <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> requests. But he also may be seeking to force the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> leaders to recognize <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>'s crucial role in the occupied lands, where most Palestinians still carry Jordanian passports. For <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and its <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> supporters, it could mean that for now, there is no viable alternative to dealing with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> if they want peace. Both have shunned the organization, claiming it is a terrorist body and _ more significantly _ fearing its demand for a Palestinian state on the flank of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Both have tried for two decades to force the Palestinians under <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>'s wing and to talk peace with <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> without the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. But <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION> he would not negotiate with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> over <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION>, repeating a warning he gave <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> in April. That leaves <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace effort, keyed on <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>, in limbo. <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON>'s move also challenges the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, which for more than two decades has failed to win open recognition from either <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> also must find ways to aid the occupied territories that bypass <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> security aimed specifically at halting <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> influence. Hoping to encourage moderate Jordanian influence, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> had tacitly cooperated with <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>'s development plan prior to the uprising. It also gave <ORGANIZATION> Jordanian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> members VIP treatment crossing the usually arduous bridge security after <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> revived <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> in 1983 _ a move criticized at the time by the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. The Parliament had been dormant since 1974, the year Arabs made the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> sole representative for Palestinians, in part because no elections could be held on the Israeli-occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> can not afford to cut too deeply into its ties with Palestinians. They dominate <LOCATION> Amman </LOCATION>'s economy and the remittances sent to <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> by Palestinians in the gulf are its most important source of foreign exhange. Most of the 800,000 <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> residents still hold Jordanian passports and about 18,000 still receive Jordanian salaries. Jordanian money is still common currency. Jordanian texts are used in schools. Jordanian officials administer hundreds of mosques and Islamic charities. Until <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> choked traffic over the <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> river bridges, thousands of <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> crossed weekly to visit family or friends and handle bank accounts on either side of the line. <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>'s great-grandfather is buried in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. Those close ties have made <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> natural rivals for Palestinian affections, creating distrust that flared into open warfare in 1970. Although <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> accepted a 1974 Arab summit resolution declaring the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> the sole representative of the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION>, it continued to insist it had responsibilities for them, and under international law, sovereignty over the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. But the king's palace advisers appeared to be shocked by the strength of anti-Jordanian sentiment expressed during the 8-month-old Palestinian uprising. Jordanian backers were often harassed and threatened, sometimes attacked. Jordanian officials also were knocked politically off balance by the uprising-inspired wave of pro-PLO sentiment in the Arab world following Jordanian pressure on the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> to meet American conditions for dealing with the organization _ effective recognition of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>.

 A mortician touring an empty funeral home in search of used equipment discovered the embalmed body of a man who had been dead four years, police said. Real estate agent <PERSON> Delores </PERSON> <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> was waiting outside the former <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Kotsis </PERSON> funeral home about 2 p.m. Saturday when the mortician ran out, saying he'd seen a body at the bottom of the stairs. Ms. <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON>, who was accompanied by her 9-year-old daughter, looked inside and saw the body stretched on a gurney. `` I did n't want to see it,'' she said. According to police, the body was that of a man who died April 1, 1984. The corpse had gone unclaimed and was sent to the state <ORGANIZATION> Anatomy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, which apparently tracked down a son. The body went to the funeral establishment but the son never showed up, according to police. Since then, the body had been kept in the basement. The funeral home moved but did not advise the real estate agency about the body, police said. Ms. <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> said the building is being sold, and the mortician was touring the building because he was thinking of buying some of the old equipment. The body was to be returned to the <ORGANIZATION> Anatomy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> because the corpse had not been claimed. Both the Kotsis funeral home number and the personal number of <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Kotsis </PERSON> listed in the telephone book are disconnected.

 Police on Sunday jailed a Palestinian described as the top <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> activist in the occupied lands and charged him with inciting unrest. Authorities also urged prosecution of <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> civilians in the deaths of three Arabs. Police also detained the head of an Arab merchants' group in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, who was held without charges or the promise of a trial, in so-called administrative detention, police spokeswoman <PERSON> Nurit </PERSON> <PERSON> Buton </PERSON> said. The spokeswoman said eight other Palestinians were rounded up for questioning about suspected involvement in a wave of recent stoning attacks in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. In the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, a 19-year-old <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> was shot in the leg during clashes with troops near the city of <LOCATION> Jenin </LOCATION>, hospital officials said. Pro-PLO activist <PERSON> Faisal </PERSON> <PERSON> Husseini </PERSON>, who has been described by Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> as the top <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> activist in Israeli-held territories, was arrested at his home in a pre-dawn raid and ordered held for six months without trial. `` Everyone who wants peace is put in jail,'' <PERSON> Husseini </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Najad </PERSON>, told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. `` My husband was speaking about peace, nothing else.'' Another leading pro-PLO activist, <PERSON> Hanna </PERSON> <PERSON> Siniora </PERSON>, and about a dozen members of the Peace Now movement protested <PERSON> Husseini </PERSON>'s arrest in front of the <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> detention center where he was held. <PERSON> Husseini </PERSON>'s arrest follows a meeting at a <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> theater in which he engaged in public dialogue with <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> peace activists and <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Amirav </PERSON>, a member of Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bloc </ORGANIZATION>. During the session, <PERSON> Husseini </PERSON>, 48, endorsed a document drawn up by <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Bassam </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharif </PERSON>, who called for direct talks between the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> at an international <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace conference. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has rejected direct dialogue with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, which it considers a terrorist group. `` As a Palestinian, my problem is with the Israelis _ so I must speak with them,'' <PERSON> Husseini </PERSON> told several hundred Israelis. Police accused him of being an activist in <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s mainstream <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla faction and of being involved in `` coordinating, inciting, and establishing'' the nearly 8-month-old Palestinian uprising, Ms. <PERSON> Buton </PERSON> said. Police ordered the closure of the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Studies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> _ which <PERSON> Husseini </PERSON> directs _ for one year starting Sunday, charging it was financed by <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION> group and was used to advance the aims of the uprising, which has claimed the lives of 235 Palestinians and four Israelis. <PERSON> Mustafa </PERSON> <PERSON> Tawfiq </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Zahara </PERSON>, head of a <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> merchants' group, was detained Sunday and accused of organizing demonstrations and boycotts of Israeli products as well as inciting Palestinians not to pay taxes, Ms. <PERSON> Buton </PERSON> said. She said <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Zahara </PERSON> spent 18 months in jail in 1979 on charges of helping a convicted terrorist. <PERSON> Husseini </PERSON> has spent 12 of the past 16 months in administrative detention. <PERSON> Husseini </PERSON> said an arrest last fall may have been partly the result of secret talks he held with <PERSON> Amirav </PERSON>. In an interview, th activist suggested his dialogue Wednesday with the Israelis may again have angered authorities. `` This may have been one of the reasons I was arrested,'' <PERSON> Husseini </PERSON> told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> legislator <PERSON> Abba </PERSON> <PERSON> Eban </PERSON> Sunday criticized the arrest. `` I see this as unwise, all this game of hide-and-seek with <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> leaders,'' <PERSON> Eban </PERSON> said in an interview with <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> radio. Israeli authorities are holding about 2,500 Palestinians without trial, the majority rounded up since the beginning of the uprising. In another development, police officials confirmed they recommended the prosecution of <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> civilians in the shooting deaths of three <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> residents. The statement came in response to a query by left-wing legislator <PERSON> Dedi </PERSON> <PERSON> Zucker </PERSON> on the status of investigations into 13 Palestinian deaths in which <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> civilians were suspected. Police did not say how many Israelis could be prosecuted. Police recommended prosecution in the case involving the Jan. 11 shooting death of <PERSON> Nasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Ghanem </PERSON> <PERSON> Hammad </PERSON>, 17, of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> village <LOCATION> Betin </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Nahum </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaked </PERSON>, a spokesman for Police Minister <PERSON> Chaim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bar-Lev </PERSON>. The report did not name the suspect, but police at the time held <PERSON> Pinhas </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallerstein </PERSON>, a prominent Jewish settler leader, for questioning. The army has said <PERSON> Wallerstein </PERSON> opened fire after being stoned by Palestinian youths, but <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> witnesses said <PERSON> Hammad </PERSON> was killed without provocation. In three other cases, police recommended that no charges be filed for lack of evidence, said <PERSON> Shaked </PERSON>.

 An Afghan guerrilla spokesman said Sunday that guerrillas will release two Soviet prisoners of war as a gesture of good will. The news came as the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported that Afghan rebels staged a rocket attack on their capital of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, killing one person and wounding three. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>, quoting <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Bakhtar </ORGANIZATION> news agency, said several houses were damaged by the ground-to-ground missiles. It gave no further details. The attack was the latest in a series on <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> and other Afghan cities by rebels seeking to topple the Marxist government of President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>. The seven-party <ORGANIZATION> Afghan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guerrilla </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s frontier city of <LOCATION> Peshawar </LOCATION>, said in a news release in <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION> that two prisoners of war were being freed as a `` good-will gesture. <PERSON> Ahmad </PERSON> <PERSON> Gailani </PERSON>, chairman of the alliance, said the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s reaction to the prisoner release would decide the fate of Soviet troops still held by Afghan guerrillas The Soviets say 312 soldiers are missing in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. The alliance wants to hold direct talks with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, both about imprisoned Soviet soldiers and the peaceful withdrawal of <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> troops from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gulbaddin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hekmatyar </PERSON>, another guerrilla leader, said at a news conference in <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION> that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> must initiate talks. <PERSON> Azim </PERSON> <PERSON> Nasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Zia </PERSON>, with <PERSON> Gailani </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, said the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> had `` already'' indicated a willingness to talk about prisoners of war but the guerrillas wanted talks expanded to include other issues, including the Soviet withdrawal. The Soviets began withdrawing troops from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> May 15. Under the terms of a U.N.-brokered accord signed in April, it must withdraw half of its more than 100,000 estimated troops by Aug. 15 and the rest by next Feb. 15. Guerrilla leaders have said that until the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> opens direct talks with them, they can not guarantee safe passage for withdrawing troops. The Kremlin ordered troops and tanks into <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in December 1979 to prop up the communist government there. Since the Soviets began their pullout, official Soviet and <LOCATION> Afghan </LOCATION> media have been reporting a sharp increase in attacks on Afghan cities by the mostly Moslem guerrillas.

 After <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Ives </PERSON> and his best friend were run over by a train, the state medical examiner ruled they had smoked so much marijuana that they lay down on the tracks and did not hear the roar of the oncoming <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> freight. Dr. <PERSON> Fahmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Malak </PERSON>'s report said the boys slept as if in a coma, motionless, in identical positions, their legs across the rails and their torsos between the tracks, as the train bore down with horn blaring and bells clanging. But the youths' parents refused to accept <PERSON> Malak </PERSON>'s ruling of accidental death. It was extremely unlikely that marijuana could have had such an extreme effect, they said, and that the boys would pass out in identical positions. `` We're willing to go to any length to solve this thing,'' said <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Ives </PERSON>, <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON>'s father. `` All we want to know is what happened. If someone can convince us beyond a doubt that this is what happened, we can let it go. But until then, as long as there's a doubt, we will pursue it.'' Their determination prompted investigations by a grand jury, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Arkansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> into the Aug. 23, 1987 deaths of Ives, 17, and 16-year-old <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Henry </PERSON>, on the tracks about 15 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rock </LOCATION>. In June, grand jurors issued a preliminary report saying the deaths were `` probably homicide.'' The grand jury has continued meeting but has not rendered a final report. `` We feel that people connected in the drug business know something about these deaths,'' special deputy prosecuting attorney <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Harmon </PERSON> said last month. Several witnesses who came before the grand jury have been charged with drug trafficking and other offenses. The boys' parents initially accepted <PERSON> Malak </PERSON>'s autopsy report, `` not knowing any more about marijuana than we did,'' <PERSON> Ives </PERSON> said. His wife, <PERSON> Linda </PERSON>, began reading books about marijuana and its effects. They talked to experts on marijuana. `` The more we found out about it, the less likely it seemed that that was the real cause,'' <PERSON> Ives </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Ives </PERSON>, coincidentally a <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> engineer, said he recreated the death scene in his mind during late-night train runs. `` Several times, I've tried to simulate the situation and see how much reaction time I would have, to get an idea of exactly how much time the boys had after the horns started blowing and all that to make some type of movement,'' <PERSON> Ives </PERSON> said. The boys had told <PERSON> Don </PERSON>'s parents they were going hunting, and a .22 - caliber rifle and flashlight were found at the accident Several students said the youths told them they were going `` spotlighting'' for deer, using a light to temporarily blind the animals and make them easier to shoot. Witnesses at a public hearing in February said they smoked marijuana with <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> and <PERSON> Don </PERSON> the night before their deaths, with estimates ranging from one cigarette to about five shared by a group of nine teen-agers. At the same hearing, <PERSON> Malak </PERSON> stood by his judgment that the `` psychedelic'' effects of marijuana could have knocked the the boys out. The results of an independent autopsy have not been made public, but <LOCATION> Saline </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Deputy Prosecutor <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Garrett </PERSON> has presented testimony from medical experts and quoted researchers as calling it `` highly unlikely, if not impossible, for a person to pass out from smoking marijuana.'' `` Common sense would also tell you that it would not be probable that any two people would pass out at the same time from the use of any drug or alcohol, and for them to pass out in exactly the same position would really be improbable,'' <PERSON> Garrett </PERSON> said.

 A pier jammed with thousands of people going to a festival collapsed Sunday in northwestern <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>. At least 35 people were killed and 737 were injured, the official news agency reported Monday. <PERSON> Mazlan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ariffin </PERSON>, deputy police chief at <LOCATION> Butterworth </LOCATION>, a coastal city 190 miles northwest of the capital, said the death toll was expected to rise because 40 of the injured were in critical condition, the <ORGANIZATION> Bernama </ORGANIZATION> news agency reported. One of the injured, <PERSON> Jenny </PERSON> <PERSON> Ang </PERSON>, a 13-year-old student from <PERSON> Butterworth </PERSON>, said, `` I managed to cling to the edge of the platform and was helped up by a man. `` Below me ... I saw a whole load of people piled down ... There was total pandemonium and chaos with people rushing to get out of the human pile,'' she told the national news agency <ORGANIZATION> Bernama </ORGANIZATION>. She suffered only a slight facial injury. Gee <PERSON> Swee </PERSON> <PERSON> Cain </PERSON>, a 41-year-old woman who had been waiting to cross over on a ferry to the festival, told <ORGANIZATION> Bernama </ORGANIZATION> Monday: `` Everything happened so fast, I could only scream for help. `` I ... heard someone from above telling me to be patient, because at that time nothing could be done to help me,'' she was quoted as saying. Mrs. Gee was pinned under steel and timber wreckage from the platform, suffering chest and facial injuries and a broken leg. Many passengers fell onto the platform about 40 feet underneath. The platform gives vehicles access to ferries and holds a port commission office. <ORGANIZATION> Bernama </ORGANIZATION> said firefighters and port workers still were searching the debris late Sunday for more bodies. <PERSON> Ariffin </PERSON> said a huge crowd was waiting for ferries to take them to <LOCATION> Penang </LOCATION> island, about three miles across the Stait of <LOCATION> Malacca </LOCATION>, for a festival when a section of the structure collapsed. The accident occurred at 4:40 p.m. <PERSON> Syed </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohamad </PERSON> <PERSON> Aidid </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Penang </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ports </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> that operates the ferry terminal, said there usually are only 200 people at a time on the section that collapsed. He said more than 300 people were moving across it to enter a ferry when it gave way and that more than 3,000 people were lined up behind them. `` We had enough personnel to control the situation and instructed them to allow the passengers in batches of about 200 to 300, but the crowd was too big and the platform gave way,'' he said. `` We were prepared to meet the massive passenger crowd and traffic in view of the <PERSON> Kwan </PERSON> <PERSON> Yin </PERSON> festival on the island, but never thought the section would collapse,'' he said. The festival, when Chinese offer prayers to the Goddess of Mercy, or <PERSON> Kwan </PERSON> <PERSON> Yin </PERSON>, is held once every 60 years according to Chinese tradition. Of <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>'s 16 million people, about 4.8 million are Chinese. There were no reports of foreigners among the casualties. Thirty-five people have so far been reported dead and 737 injured in the collapse, <ORGANIZATION> Bernama </ORGANIZATION> said Monday, quoting police and other sources. <PERSON> Ariffin </PERSON> said 17 bodies were recovered at the scene and 13 people died at the <LOCATION> Butterworth </LOCATION> district hospital. He said 180 victims were in the Butterworth hospital, 149 in the nearby <LOCATION> Bukit </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mertajam </LOCATION> district hospital, and 40 in critical condition in the Penang general hospital. Another official gave somewhat higher figures. Penang state Chief Minister Dr. <PERSON> Lim </PERSON> <PERSON> Chong </PERSON> <PERSON> Eu </PERSON> told reporters that 475 people were involved in the collapse. He said 30 were confirmed to have died at the scene, 391 were admitted to hospital emergency wards, and 54 received outpatient treatment. Prime Minister <PERSON> Datuk </PERSON> <PERSON> Seri </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahathir </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohamad </PERSON> said his government would provide aid for the victims and would consider compensation for their families. The section of the pier that collapsed was about 40 feet long. Three cars entering the ferry were crushed, and the port commission office under the platform was destroyed. The jetty with the pier was built in 1956 and repaired from time to time, <ORGANIZATION> Bernama </ORGANIZATION> reported. The platform which collapsed was last renovated in early 1986, when its planks and bolts were replaced. The structure was built with pillars only at the sides of the structure and not in the center, where the section failed. In <LOCATION> Kuala </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lumpur </LOCATION>, the capital, Transport Minister <PERSON> Ling </PERSON> <PERSON> Liong </PERSON> <PERSON> Sik </PERSON> told reporters that an open inquiry would be held to determine why the jetty collapsed.

 National Urban League President <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON> on Sunday lashed out at the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, saying he questioned its claims of trying to woo black voters in this year's presidential election. <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON> said at a news conference opening the group's four-day national conference that likely <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> presidential nominee <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> declined an invitation to address the gathering `` just as <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> did n't come in 1984.'' `` That makes you wonder about the sincerity of claims to try to get black support in 1988,'' he said. `` It makes you wonder about the wisdom of the advice he's getting. `` And it makes you wonder whether a candidate who refuses to come to the Urban League's annual meeting will be a president who refuses to let the Urban League come to the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON> said. In remarks prepared for his keynote address Sunday night, <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON> continued his criticism of the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION>. `` Eight years ago, <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> rode into town and everyone but blacks cheered,'' he said. `` Americans have now discovered why blacks were n't waving their hats. ... `` Never in living memory has there been an administration whose policies have been so insensitive to the needs of poor and working people,'' <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON> said. `` And we remind <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> that more, far more, poor people are white than black.'' In the speech, <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON> called for racial parity by 2000, a national job program, an early-childhood education program, welfare reform, health care for people with no health insurance and `` aggressive national policies to protect civil rights and wipe out the last vestiges of racism and discrimination.'' Although critical of the Republicans, <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON> said the organization would not endorse any candidate for the Nov. 8 general election. On Saturday, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodin </PERSON> said a scheduling conflict prevented the vice president from accepting the invitation. He said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> plans to spend this week examining potential running mates and will deliver a major foreign policy speech in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> on Tuesday. The Urban League conference will hear from Democratic presidential nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> on Monday and <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> on Wednesday. Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION>, a candidate for the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> presidential nomination during the early days of the 1988 campaign, will be part of a panel discussion on the election Tuesday night. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>'s name has been mentioned as a possible running mate for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 The following are excerpts from King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>'s address to the nation Sunday as translated from Arabic by The Associated Press: <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> is not Palestine ... The independent Palestinian state will be established on the occupied Palestinian land after its liberation, God willing. There the Palestinian identity will be embodied, and there the Palestinian struggle shall come to fruition as confirmed by the glorious uprising of the Palestinian people under occupation. We assure you that these measures do not mean the abandonment of our national duty, either towards the <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> conflict or towards the Palestinian cause. These steps were taken only in response to the wish of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> ... and the prevailing Arab conviction that such measures would contribute to the struggle of the Palestinian people.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 No one outside <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION> has had, or can have an attachment to <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION>, or its cause, firmer than that of <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> or of my family. <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> will not give up its commitment to take part in the peace process. We have contributed to the peace process until it reached a stage of a consensus to convene an international peace conference on the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> ast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> is a principal party to the <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> conflict and to the peace process ... It shoulders its national responsibility on that basis.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 In addition to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- ambition to embody the Palestinian identity on <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> national soil, -LRB- there should be -RRB- the separation of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> from the Hashemite kingdom of <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 -LRB- The timing of his actions -RRB- derive from ... the principles of <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> unity and the political reality of the scope of benefit to the Palestinian people's struggle that accrues from maintaing the legal relationship between the two Banks. We believe that such unity between two or more Arab peoples is a right of choice for every Arab people. We have responded to the wish of the representatives of the Palestinian people for unity with <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> in 1950. We respect the wish of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- for -RRB- an independent Palestinian state.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> will remain the proud bearer of the message of the great Arab revolt, faithful to its principles, believing in the common Arab destiny and committed to joint Arab action. Since the Israeli aggression of June 1967, it has been our belief that our first priority should be to liberate the land and holy places from <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation. We had never imagined that the preservation of the legal and administrative links between the two Banks could constitute an obstacle to the liberation of the occupied Palestinian land. Yet lately it has transpired that there is a general Palestinian and <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> orientation towards highlighting the Palestinian identity in a complete manner, in every effort or activity related to the Palestinian question and its developments. -LRB- <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>'s maintaining links with the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> -RRB- contradicts this orientation -LRB- and -RRB- hampers the Palestinian strugle to gain international support for the Palestinian cause, as the national cause of a people struggling against foreign occupation.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 -LRB- It is the view of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> leaders that the struggle -RRB- to liberate the occupied Palestinian land could be enhanced by dismantling the -LRB- <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>'s -RRB- legal and administrative links. We have to fulfil our duty and do what is required of us. We pray God that this step be a subtantive addition to the intensifying Palestinian struggle for freedom and independence.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 It has to be understood in all clarity and without any ambiguity or equivocation that our measures regarding the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> concern only the occupied Palestinian land and its people -LRB- and -RRB- do not relate in any way to the Jordanian citizens of Palestinian origin in the Hashemite kingdom of <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>. National unity is precious in any country but in <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> it is more than that. It is the basis of our stability and the springboard of our development and prosperity ... It is a living example of constructive plurality and a sound nucleus for wider Arab unity. Any attempt to undermine it -LRB- unity -RRB- under any pretext would only help the enemy carry out his policy of expansion at the expense of <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> alike.

<TEXT>
 Two more men posing as police officers have been arrested in connection with the shooting deaths of a television anchorwoman, her mother-in-law and friend. Juarez Chief of Police <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Mota </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> said Saturday the men were arrested in <LOCATION> Reynosa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, on Friday. They have not been formally charged with the killings, but have been transferred to a Juarez jail. Four other men were arrested shortly after the July 23 shootings. On Saturday, about 2,500 protesters demanding justice solemnly marched from the shooting site to the city hall of this town across the border from <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. XHIJ-TV anchorwoman <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Bejarano </PERSON>, 28, her mother-in-law, <PERSON> Lucrecia </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON>, and a family friend <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Alfonso </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> were gunned down after men identifying themselves as federal police stopped their car. Police said they shot into the car at least 47 times because they had mistaken the <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yorker </ORGANIZATION> for another car allegedly carrying drug dealers. Ms. <PERSON> Bejarano </PERSON>'s husband, <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, who survived the shooting, has disputed the police version. He said police dragged <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> screaming out of the car and shot him in the head. An agent of the federal judicial police and three others who are part of an illegal crew of part-time officers, called `` madrinas,'' have been charged in the slayings. Charged with murder are federal agent <PERSON> Joaquin </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> <PERSON> Mendez </PERSON> and three men allegedly working for him as free-lance policemen: <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON> <PERSON> Silgueiro </PERSON>, <PERSON> Santos </PERSON> <PERSON> Robles </PERSON> and <PERSON> Noe </PERSON> <PERSON> Librado </PERSON> <PERSON> Zavala </PERSON>. Besides murder, other charges include abuse of power, using machine guns permitted only for the army and acting without authority. Federal District Judge <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Librado </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuerte </PERSON> <PERSON> Chavez </PERSON> formally charged the four officers Friday. A trial date has not been set. Charges remain pending against the two men arrested Friday. They have been identified as <PERSON> Felipe </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, 26, and <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>, 25. <PERSON> Mota </PERSON> said both men were carrying cards falsely identifying them as Juarez city police. Each man could be sentenced to 40 years in prison if convicted, according to <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> <PERSON> Holguin </PERSON> <PERSON> Cisneros </PERSON>. There is no death penalty in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON>, who is also an anchor at the TV station, said at least 10 men were involved in the attack. <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON> led the protest march Saturday that included journalists carrying banners with messages such as: `` We want police, not murderers,'' `` We're reporters. Do n't shoot,'' and `` Stop police impunity.'' Others wore T-shirts with the words: `` Please do n't shoot, I'm not a narco. Many were waving white handkerchiefs along the four-mile march. Standing on a flat-bed trailer, <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON> asked the crowd for their support. `` I want to invite you, when you see an injustice, protest _ everyone here,'' he said. `` It does n't matter what religion you profess, or what political party you belong to, or whether you're rich or poor.

 With civil rights activists planning a protest this week, three white lawmen accused of killing a black jail inmate face another round in their battle to avoid further prosecution. The defendants were acquitted by a state court jury on July 15 of violating the civil rights of Loyal <PERSON> Garner </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> truck driver, and state prosecutors now want to try them on first-degree murder charges. The defendants, former <PERSON> Hemphill </PERSON> Police Chief <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Ladner </PERSON>, 41, and former <LOCATION> Sabine </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> sheriff's deputies <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> `` </PERSON> <PERSON> Bo </PERSON><PERSON> '' </PERSON> <PERSON> Hyden </PERSON>, 34, and <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Horton </PERSON>, 58, argue that that would violate constitutional protections against being tried twice for the same offense. <PERSON> Garner </PERSON>, 34, of <LOCATION> Florien </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La. </LOCATION>, and two companions were arrested Christmas night. <PERSON> Garner </PERSON> died two days later, after allegedly being beaten in the <LOCATION> Sabine </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jail </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ladner </PERSON> admitted to striking <PERSON> Garner </PERSON> on the head once with a stick but said he only used force necessary to subdue <PERSON> Garner </PERSON> after <PERSON> Garner </PERSON> hit him in the head and neck. State District Judge <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Tunnell </PERSON> dismissed the defendants' claims last month that the murder trials amount to double jeopardy Their appeal is to be heard in the state court of appeals here Thursday. Although the three were tried together in <PERSON> Hemphill </PERSON> on the civil rights violation charges, they face separate murder trials, with <PERSON> Ladner </PERSON>'s scheduled to start next Monday. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON>, an assistant district attorney for <LOCATION> Smith </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, said he doubts the trial will start on time and that the trials could be consolidated at a later date. The trial's venue was changed to <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON> from <PERSON> Hemphill </PERSON>, where the civil rights case was heard.

<HEAD>Abandoned Cars Remain As Shredders Try To Reach Accord On
Harzardous Waste</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>

 Hundreds of abandoned cars are cluttering streets in and around <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> amid efforts to end a dispute over hazardous waste at two major automobile shredders. `` We do have a definite problem. There is a list of several hundred cars to be towed,'' said <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bedford </LOCATION> Police Sgt. <PERSON> Frederic </PERSON> <PERSON> Anselmo </PERSON>. `` We're in limbo. The cars are being abandoned on side streets and they are staying there because the 16 tow companies working for us have suspended their operations.'' The backup began after the voluntary closings in June of <ORGANIZATION> Prolerized </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> England </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, of <PERSON> Everett </PERSON>, and a subsidiary, Patriot Metals of <LOCATION> Worcester </LOCATION>. The closings came after the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Quality </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineering </ORGANIZATION> determined in June there were high levels of PCBs and oil byproducts in the residue, called fluff, from shredded cars at Patriot Metals. `` We since signed a limited compliance agreement on July 11 and they are targeting the threat at both facilities,'' <ORGANIZATION> DEQE </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Katie </PERSON> <PERSON> Stimmel </PERSON> said. `` It calls for the covering of residue stored on site and building some kind of containment facility.'' But it was unclear when the two yards, which handle an estimated 350,000 cars annually, would be able to resume operation. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Romei </PERSON>, general manager of Prolerized, said he hopes something will happen soon or he may have to lay off workers. `` And I ca n't even start to assess the effects of the 900 or so auto wreckers in the state,'' <PERSON> Romei </PERSON> said. `` Once their yards get filled and there is no place to go with cars, there is lot of back-up industry of material.'' The shutdown has forced <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> officials to store about 800 cars, with even more waiting to be towed, said city Transportation Commissioner <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dimino </PERSON>. `` We have a backlog of 1,500 out there,'' <PERSON> Dimino </PERSON> said. `` We are getting close to capacity. ...'' In all, <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> has four major car shredders and two firms that handle the shredding of such appliances as washing machines. Once a car is towed by a salvage service, a machine is used to flatten it. Most of the oil, brake fluid and other liquids, are removed during this phase. The metal hulk is then sold to a shredding company, where machine-swung hammers complete the destruction, separating the ferrous metal from non-magnetic metals and other materials. `` Fifty percent of what is shaken out is plain dirt. The rest is plastics, glass, carpeting, rubber around the windows and other things. You can touch it and not come away with any grease or oil on your hands,'' said <PERSON> Romei </PERSON> of Prolerized. `` DEQE said the amount of <ORGANIZATION> PCB </ORGANIZATION> levels in the fluff was more than 50 parts per million, meaning it was hazardous waste. But from our standpoint, the <ORGANIZATION> PCB </ORGANIZATION> levels have always been controlled.''

 Nearly 2,000 prisoners were on death row last year while 25 inmates were executed, both figures record highs since the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> reinstated capital punishment in 1976, the government reported Sunday. The highest population on death row previously was 1,800 in 1986. There were 21 inmates executed in 1984, the former yearly high. State courts sentenced nearly 300 people to death in 1987, while the death sentences of 79 were vacated or commuted, the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION> said. A total of 1,984 men and women were on death row in 34 states as of Dec. 31. Just 2.9 percent of the people under death sentences were executed from 1976 to 1987 _ 92 men and one woman. During the same years, nearly 1,100 people, or 34.3 percent of those facing capital punishment, were removed from death row. The 25 prisoners executed last year in eight states had spent an average of seven years and two months waiting for the sentence to be carried out. More than 60 percent of the death row prisoners were held in states in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>, 18 percent in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>, 15 percent in the <LOCATION> Midweat </LOCATION> and 5 percent in the Northeast. More than 57 percent of the death row inmates were white and 41 percent were black. Women represented 1.1 percent of the death row inmates. All of the convicts were under a death sentence for murder, except for a man found guilty of the capital rape of a child. During the period of time since the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> has reinstated the death penalty, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> reported 224,400 murders and non-negligent manslaughters and 217,120 arrests for these crimes. Thirty-seven states had death penalty statutes as of the end of last year, while 13 states and the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> did not. About two of every five prisoners sentenced to death were in trouble with the law at the time of the capital offense, with half of them on parole and the remainder in prison, escaped from prison, on probation or with charges pending against them.

<TEXT>
 Police used tear gas to break up a protest rally in a town near the resort city of <LOCATION> Acapulco </LOCATION> and newspapers reported Sunday that a 5-year-old boy was killed in the melee. The violence occurred Saturday night in <LOCATION> Coyuca </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Benitez </LOCATION>, 23 miles north of <LOCATION> Acapulco </LOCATION>. An estimated 300 people had gathered outside the town hall to demand the election of a mayor to replace the mayor who was killed earlier this month in an automobile accident. Instead of calling a new election, the <LOCATION> Guerrero </LOCATION> state legislature, which is dominated by the governing <ORGANIZATION> Institutional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, appointed party member <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Rio </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonales </PERSON> as mayor. Several newspapers said the boy was killed when a tear-gas canister hit him in the face as police dispersed the demonstrators. Government authorities said they could not confirm the death. In <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> the pro-government newspaper <LOCATION> Excelsior </LOCATION>, the independent El Universal and the liberal <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jornada </ORGANIZATION> reported a boy was killed but did not identify the victim. <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Refugio </PERSON> <PERSON> Molineros </PERSON>, a police spokesman in <LOCATION> Chilpancingo </LOCATION>, the capital of <LOCATION> Guerrero </LOCATION> state, said in a telephone interview he had reports that a few people suffered minor injuries and two autombiles were overturned. He placed the numer of protesters at the town hall Saturday night at about 300 and said some 40 people were continuing the demonstration Sunday. <PERSON> Evelia </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the state prosecutor's office, also was contacted in <LOCATION> Chilpancingo </LOCATION> by telephone She said police and soliders intervened when the protesters became `` verbally aggressive,'' but she claimed no one was injured. Repeated attempts to reach police in Coyuca de <PERSON> Benitez </PERSON> failed. Telephone operators said no official was available to answer questions because it was Sunday.

<TEXT>
 Foreign Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> said Sunday that <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> would remain a key partner in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace process despite King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>'s vow to relinquish any control over the Israeli-occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>'s reversal Sunday, which came three months before <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s national elections, dealt a severe blow to <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>. He had staked his political prestige on the `` Jordanian option'' _ peace talks with a joint Jordanian-Palestinian delegation at an international peace conference. <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>, leader of the left-of-center <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, played down the importance of <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>'s announcement by saying <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> `` committed himself to continued involvement in the peace process.'' Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>' main political rival, suggested that <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>'s move was beneficial for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> because it removed the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> as a potential issue of contention between <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>. `` We have nothing to be sorry about,'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said, referring to the king's speech. In his television speech, <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> called for keeping the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> separate from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>. He said he respected the wish of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> to `` secede from us in an independent Palestinian state.'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, head of the right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc, staunchly opposes an international conference and <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> withdrawal from the occupied territories, including the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> has said he was only willing to talk about limited self-rule for Palestinians in the occupied lands. <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> newspaper editor <PERSON> Hanna </PERSON> <PERSON> Siniora </PERSON>, a Palestinian, said <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>'s position would force <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to start talking to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> and launch `` a new chapter of cooperation between the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>.'' <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> refuses to negotiate with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, saying it is a terrorist organization. <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>'s speech came after he canceled a $ 1.3 billion development plan for the occupied territories and dissolved <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>'s lower <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> earlier this week. Half the legislators came from the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, which <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> seized from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> in the 1967 Middle East War. <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>'s announcement Sunday reversed his initial agreement to peace talks between <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and a joint <LOCATION> Jordanian-Palestinian </LOCATION> delegation under the auspices of an international conference. Such an arrangement would have helped <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> sidestep the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. Since rumors of <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>'s new policy first began to surface last week, <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> has begun raising the possibility of separate negotiations with Palestinians. <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> reiterated his new emphasis in a statement Sunday, saying: `` We are ready to talk to <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> about peace. We are ready to talk to the Palestinians about the Palestinian problem. We are ready to talk to both about peace and solving the Palestinian problem.'' <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> also said the speech did not make clear whether he relinquished all responsibility for the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. `` The election in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> will determine whether the <LOCATION> Jordanian </LOCATION> option is still alive,'' said a top <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> official, speaking on condition of anonymity. `` If Labor wins the election, I can assure you <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and Palestinians will be willing to go to an international conference as part of a joint delegation.'' A spokesman for <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>'s speech did not affect <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s stance. `` We do n't see any reason to change our position,'' <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Yossi </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahimeir </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Binyamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Netanyahu </PERSON>, a top <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> candidate in the November elections, said <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>'s new policy made it imperative for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> not to withdraw from occupied lands. `` Today, it has to become completely clear that those who talk about the transfer of territory, talk about the transfer of territory into the hands of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Netanyahu </PERSON> said in a thinly veiled attack on Labor, which favors limited territorial compromise.

 A Church of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> bishop went to <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> this week to inquire into the fate of four missing Iranians in a mission undertaken in hopes that his efforts might hasten the release of other hostages, he said Sunday. Speaking to reporters Sunday after arriving in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, the envoy, The Rev. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, said, `` I would want to say that by going ... I've made a contribution towards the overall picture, which I hope will lead towards the release of all the hostages.'' <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Waite </PERSON>, brother of missing Church of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> envoy <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Waite </PERSON>, said earlier Sunday that he hoped `` the Iranians will see that we are doing everything on our part that we can to help them ...'' He added, `` In turn, we obviously would like to see them do as much as they can ... and use their influence in that region of the world to see the release of not only my brother but all Western hostages.'' <PERSON> Waite </PERSON> disappeared Jan. 20, 1987, while seeking release of American hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Also missing in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> are British journalist <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>, kidnapped in April 1986, and teacher <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Keenan </PERSON>, who disappeared the same month. <PERSON> Keenan </PERSON> holds both Irish and British citizenship. The <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> says it also seeks word on <PERSON> Alec </PERSON> <PERSON> Collett </PERSON>, a New York-based British journalist whose Palestinian abductors claim they killed him. His body was never found. At least 18 foreigners, including nine Americans, are now missing in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Waite </PERSON> and others are believed held by pro-Iranian groups. The longest held is <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, who was abducted March 16, 1985. Christian militiamen kidnapped the Iranians in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in July 1982 during an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> invasion of that country.

He added, `` It's very important to us when we are talking to the Iranians ... to show them that we are concerned about their missing people as well as ours.'' <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> will report to <PERSON> Runcie </PERSON> on Tuesday after meeting with <PERSON> Runcie </PERSON> aide <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyttle </PERSON> on Monday, <PERSON> Lyttle </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Lyttle </PERSON> said the bishop was `` well guarded'' during his visit and did not venture out of the Christian part of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>.

 King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> on Sunday called for an independent Palestinian state in the Israeli-occupied territories and appeared to rule out the idea of <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> representing Palestinians in any peace talks. `` <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> is not Palestine,'' the king said in a speech. `` The independent Palestinian state will be established on occupied Palestinian land after its liberation, God willing.'' It was not the first time <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> had called for an independent Palestinian state, but it was the first time he categorically divorced himself from Palestinians in the occupied lands and told them to take affairs into their own hands. <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> said <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON>'s links to them `` hamper the Palestinian struggle to gain international support for the Palestinian cause, as the national cause of a people struggling against foreign occupation.'' Israeli Foreign Minister <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> said Sunday that <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> would remain a key partner in the peace process, despite <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>'s vow to relinquish any control over the Israeli-occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> Meanwhile, Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, <PERSON> Peres </PERSON>' main political rival, suggested that <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>'s move was beneficial for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> because it removed the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> as a potential issue of contention between <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> seized the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> in the 1967 Middle East War. <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>'s move could leave the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, which claims to be the sole representative of Palestinians, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s only negotiating partner in talks to resolve the issue. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> refuses to talk to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, calling it a terrorist organization. Under a recent <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> peace initiative by Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> would be partially responsible for representing the Palestinians in peace talks. Israeli leaders had called for negotiations with a joint Jordanian-Palestinian delegation and said the Palestinians must not be members of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, speaking on <ORGANIZATION> CBS-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Face the Nation,'' denied the move would pressure the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to find a way to talk to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. `` We will stay right where we are. We're ready to talk to them -LRB- PLO -RRB- when they take certain steps, which are very clear, and as far as I can see, not too onerous. After all, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> is there. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> is going to stay there. We're going to continue to support them,'' he said. The speech followed moves by <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> to give greater responsibility for <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> affairs to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. On Saturday, he dissolved the lower house of Parliament. Half the house's members were from the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. On Thursday, he canceled a $ 1.3 billion development project plan for the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> described the measures as aimed at `` enhancing the Palestinian national orientation and highlighting the Palestinian identity.'' Commenting on the meaning of establishing an independent Palestinian state, <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> said that `` in addition to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s ambition to embody the Palestinian identity on <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> national soil, -LRB- there should be -RRB- a separation of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> from the <LOCATION> Hashemite </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kingdom </LOCATION> of <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>. `` There the Palestinian identity will be embodied, and there the Palestinian struggle shall come to fruition as confirmed by the glorious uprising of the <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> people under occupation,'' he said. The 8-month-old uprising in the Israeli-occupied territories has given greater international prominence to the Palestinian cause and increased calls for an independent state. Up to two-thirds of <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>'s 3.5 million population is of Palestinian origin. `` We assure you that these measures do not mean the abandonment of our national duty, either towards the <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> conflict, or towards the Palestinian cause,'' the king said in a 17-minute address broadcast on national television. He added `` that these steps were taken only in response to the wish of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> ... and the prevailing Arab conviction that such measures would contribute to the struggle of the Palestinian people.'' In <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, prominent <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Faisal </PERSON> <PERSON> Husseini </PERSON> said Saturday that <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> was sending a clear message to both the Americans and the Israelis with his recent moves. `` These steps ... mean that everything must be transferred to the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> must be responsible for everything here,'' he said. `` <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> is sending a message that there is no Jordanian option; there is no way but the Palestinian option through the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>.'' <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> pays $ 50 million in salaries to teachers, lawyers and other employees who work in Arab institutions in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. The king affirmed his commitment to the `` support and asistance for the Palestinian people until they achieve their national goals, God willing.'' <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> said his country `` will not give up its commitment to take part in the peace process.'' `` We have contributed to the peace process until it reached a stage of a consensus to convene an international peace conference on the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>,'' the king said.

 Men whose jobs combine high psychological demands with little control over their work face two to three times the risk of heart attack that other male workers do, a new study suggests. Cooks, waiters, computer operators, gas station attendants and some assembly line workers were among the high-risk jobs found in the analysis of nearly 5,000 men. But employers may be able to redesign high-risk jobs to lower heart attack risk and improve productivity, said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Karasek </PERSON>, associate professor in the industrial and systems engineering department at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Karasek </PERSON> reports the study's findings in the August issue of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>, along with co-authors from <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Stony </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brook </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. The study focused on job strain, which results from having too little control over one's work to deal satisfactorily with its psychological demands. Those demands included having to work quickly and facing heavy workloads. Executive and professional jobs were not considered high-strain because they include a lot of control, <PERSON> Karasek </PERSON> said. The study was based on past heart attacks reported by men in two federal surveys. Too few women with heart attacks appeared in those surveys for a meaningful analysis of them, <PERSON> Karasek </PERSON> said. One federal study, the Health Examination Survey done in 1960-61, found 39 heart attacks among 2,409 employed men. The other, the Health and Nutrition Examination Survey, done from 1971 to 1975, counted 30 heart attacks among 2,424 employed men. To assess job characteristics for all 4,833 men, researchers used federal studies of the conditions faced by workers of various jobs. Measurements for job traits such as control over the work were computed for 221 occupations. Then those measurements were adjusted for each worker based on his age, race, education, geographic region and whether or not he was self-employed or worked in a city. The study gave two sets of findings, one from each of the large federal surveys: _ Men whose jobs put them in the top 20 percent for job strain had 2.48 times and 3.28 times the risk of heart attack of the other workers The comparison took into account their ages, which <PERSON> Karasek </PERSON> said was the most important influence on heart attack risk, but ignored other risk factors like smoking. _ Men in the top 10 percent for job strain ran 3.8 and 4.79 times the heart attack risk of men in the lowest 10 percent Jobs in the top 10 percent included cashiers and waiters, while those in the bottom 10 percent included foresters, natural scientists and civil engineers. This comparison took into account a list of heart attack risk factors: age, race, cigarette use, education, blood pressure and cholesterol levels. _ Job strain appeared to account for between a fourth and a third of heart attacks in the two surveys This analysis accounted only for age, but <PERSON> Karasek </PERSON> said the results were similar when the other risk factors were also considered. The study does not prove that job strain raises the risk of heart attacks, <PERSON> Karasek </PERSON> said, but the idea is supported by other research. In this study, researchers did not know if workers were in their reported jobs when the heart attack occurred. But it is unlikely that a worker would have a heart attack in a low-strain job and later move into a high-strain one, <PERSON> Karasek </PERSON> said. Giving workers more control has long been advocated as a means of increasing productivity, he said. It might also reduce job strain, along with letting workers use underutilized skills and making their jobs platforms for learning new skills, he said. <PERSON> Karasek </PERSON>'s results are impressive, said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Krantz </PERSON>, professor of medical psychology at the <ORGANIZATION> Uniformed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Bethesda </LOCATION>, Md. The `` very promising'' job strain hypothesis should be tested by research that measures each worker's job strain directly, follows him over time and takes the various risk factors into account, <PERSON> Krantz </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 The Paraguayan Roman Catholic church, in a statement read Sunday at churches throughout the country, said it is being persecuted by the government of President <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>. It called on the government to `` respect the fundamental rights of human dignity.'' On Saturday, the church announced the suspension of a <ORGANIZATION> Te </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mass </ORGANIZATION>, a service of thanksgiving, that had been scheduled for Aug. 15. Both actions were taken in response to the expulsion last Monday of a Spanish-born Jesuit priest, <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> la </PERSON> <PERSON> Vega </PERSON>, who was accused of advocating rebellion. The statement read at the Masses Sunday said in part: `` We recently have observed repressive acts that affect and seriously violate the dignity of the people, such as arbitrary arrests, limitations on freedom of expression and, once again, the expulsion of a priest from the country.'' The message had the title, `` A situation of persecution of the church due to arbitrary expulsion of Father <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> de la Vega.'' It was drawn up by the <ORGANIZATION> Presbyterial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, which represents the country's about 800 priests. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> la </PERSON> <PERSON> Vega </PERSON>, a 65-year-old theology professor, was arrested and deported to <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> on July 25. The government accused him of publicly advocating the violent overthrow of the government in comments he made at a conference on Liberation Theology. Church officials denied the claim and said de la <PERSON> Vega </PERSON> had been explaining Liberation Theology, a movement that seeks political change as a way to achieve social reform. The archbishop of <LOCATION> Asuncion </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Ismael </PERSON> <PERSON> Rolon </PERSON>, sent a note to the government Saturday announcing cancellation of the Te Deum Mass held annually to mark the anniversary of the Aug. 15, 1537, founding of the city of <LOCATION> Asuncion </LOCATION>. This year the date coincides with the inauguration of Gen. <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> for an eighth consecutive term as president. <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>, 75, has ruled the country since he seized power in a 1954 coup supported by the armed forces and the <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. He was re-elected to a new term, with 88.6 percent of the vote, in elections in February. Opposition parties called the balloting fraudulent. Te Deum Masses were canceled on two previous occasions in the last 20 years _ in November 1969 and May 1972. Both followed the government's expulsion of priests. A total of 21 foreign-born priests and religious workers, most of them natives of <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, have been expelled since <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON> took power. <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> leaders have been frequent critics of <PERSON> Stroessner </PERSON>'s authoritarian rule

<TEXT>
 Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> sets out Monday on a 10-day visit to nine Latin American countries, intending to discuss ways of bringing new pressure to bear on <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s leftist government and to call attention to democratic gains elsewhere in the hemisphere. The first stop is <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> will meet with the foreign ministers of four Central American countries in an attempt to come up with a common strategy for exerting diplomatic pressure on <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> to establish democracy. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> on Sunday said that a statement which he said was drafted mostly by the foreign ministers of <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> is still open to discussion. `` We're not trying to ram anything down anyone's throat. Having drafted it, they are not so sure they want to issue it,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said on <ORGANIZATION> CBS-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Face the Nation.'' A senior administration official, who briefed reporters on Friday, said it was unclear whether the <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> meeting will result in a joint statement of principles designed to prod <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> into complying with its stated commitment to move toward democracy. The official, who insisted on anonymity, said a consensus on a common policy toward <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> has been difficult to reach. The special <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> envoy to <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> <PERSON> Busby </PERSON>, has been consulting on that issue with officials from the four Central American democracies. In <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> on Sunday, Nicarguan President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> urged the four countries to reject any <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attempt to condemn or isolate his country. He said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is `` trying to escalate the war ... with consequences for all the <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> countries, not just for <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> told reporters he hoped `` the <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> governments will respond with dignity and firmness and reject the proposal of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' Meanwhile, a Guatemalan legislator accused the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> of trying to pressure the four countries into signing a virtual `` declaration of war'' against <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. The legislator, <PERSON> Edmund </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulet </PERSON> <PERSON> Lesiur </PERSON>, representing a political party known as the Union of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, said President <PERSON> Vinicio </PERSON> <PERSON> Cerzo </PERSON> rejected a demand by <PERSON> Busby </PERSON> to abandon <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>'s policy of `` active neutrality'' by agreeing to the document <PERSON> Mulet </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> had agreed to sign it, while <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> turned it down. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> issued a statement Sunday categorically denying <PERSON> Mulet </PERSON>'s statements, made in an interview with a <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> newspaper. `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has not ` pressured' <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> or any other country. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has not asked <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> to abandon ` active neutrality,''' the embassy said. A fragile cease-fire remains in place in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> but there has been no progress on a final settlement between the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> and the Contra rebels. The impasse has produced calls by conservative members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for a renewal of military aid to the rebels, In public statements this past week, rebel leaders have maintained that the truce has helped the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> by enabling them to strengthen their overall military position at a time when the Contras have been denied lethal aid from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The administration has contended that the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> also have stepped up internal repression since the truce went into effect four months ago. In a commentary this past week in The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Times, Assistant Secretary of State <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> said the situation in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> deteriorated after <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> rejected a Contra military aid request in February. `` Since then, the predictable has happened: The communists have increased repression and mocked the promises they made. And why not, when our military support for the fighters has been halted while <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> arms deliveries continue?'' Much of <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s trip will be devoted to highlighting the democratic trend in the hemisphere. All of the nations on his itinerary have elected governments and all, with the exception of <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, became democratic over the past nine years. After <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> will travel to <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION> before a return trip, lasting 24 hours, to <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> on Aug. 8 for talks in <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. The trip ends on Aug. 10 when <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> will attend the inaugural ceremony of Ecuadoran President-elect <PERSON> Rodrigo </PERSON> <PERSON> Borja </PERSON>. While in <LOCATION> Quito </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> also will confer with President <PERSON> Jaime </PERSON> <PERSON> Lucinchi </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION> and President <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> has visited each country on his schedule before except <LOCATION> Bolivia </LOCATION>, where officials give President <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Paz </PERSON> <PERSON> Estenssoro </PERSON> high marks for revitalizing the economy and moving decisively against drug smugglers. In <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paz </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> will deliver a speech on the drug issue. <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> believes the focus on administration setbacks in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> have deflected attention from the democratic progress made elsewhere in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. In his Times' commentary, <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> wrote that throughout the 7 -LCB- years of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> presidency, no Latin American democracy has been replaced by a dictatorship. Pronouncing <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s policy an `` extraordinary success,'' <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> said that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has helped promote `` the greatest expansion of democracy in Latin history.''

 Defrocked preacher <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> prayed for cigarette-smoking followers to be delivered from nicotine Sunday, at a service on the biblical Mount of Olives overlooking <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. The television evangelist told about 200 Christians visiting from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> that <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> would return to the mountain where they were seated. `` I do n't know if I'm coming back to this hotel, and I do n't know if you'll be coming back, but I know <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> is coming back,'' he said The Louisiana-based preacher was speaking after a dinner at the <ORGANIZATION> Intercontinental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hotel </ORGANIZATION> restaurant on the mount. After a sermon on <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>'s history, <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> called sinners and nicotine addicts to gather around him so he could pray for their salvation. `` People bound by nicotine _ you must be delivered from nicotine,'' <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> said. `` There are worse things than nicotine, but this is a place to get free.'' Dozens of listeners raised their hands hesitantly, then stood up and approached the restaurant's makeshift pulpit. `` I command the bondage to be broken ... I am asking that Satan's hold be broken,'' <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> said in a special prayer for smokers `` These people belong to God ... You are trespassing.'' The evangelist said he has never smoked a cigarette in his life. <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON> stepped down from the pulpit last February after confessing to an unspecified sin. A prostitute, <PERSON> Debra </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphee </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, later said he paid her to pose naked for him in a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans-area </LOCATION> motel. The Assemblies of God denomination revoked <PERSON> Swaggart </PERSON>'s ministry credentials in May, when he insisted on returning to his multi-million dollar ministry instead of waiting out a yearlong suspension demanded by the church. About 350 American followers joined him on a weeklong tour to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s biblical sites. The group arrived last Thursday. According to the Bible, the <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Olives </LOCATION> is the site where <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> started his triumphal entry into <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> and was later arrested.

Funds</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The home county of House Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, collected the most federal money on a per capita basis of any large urban area in the nation in 1986, a newspaper's analysis found The Dallas Morning News, which tracked federal spending for fiscal years 1986 and 1987 through 50 states and 3,041 counties, reported Sunday that <LOCATION> Tarrant </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> achieved its top ranking primarily through the awarding of multibillion-dollar defense contracts. The federal government spent more than $ 5.5 billion, or $ 5,481 per person, in <LOCATION> Tarrant </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> in 1986. The next year, amid a steep decline in defense spending, the county dropped to the No. 4 per capita position with $ 4.4 billion, or $ 4,030 per person, according to the newspaper's analysis. <LOCATION> Tarrant </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>'s 1986-87 total was $ 9.9 billion, or $ 9,511 per capita. The average <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> county studied received a two-year total of $ 3,577 per person for 1986 and 1987. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> district includes most of <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> and the suburban cities in northwestern <LOCATION> Tarrant </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. He has represented the district for more than three decades, and the county's high ranking in part is a reflection of <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s increasing influence in how tax dollars are spent. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> is unopposed for re-election this year but faces an investigation by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics committee into allegations that he improperly interceded on behalf of troubled savings and loan executives in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and that he wrongly profited from royalties on a book. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s critics say the spending ranking only reinforces <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s image as a provincial, pork-barrel politician. `` <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> generates more pork than is hanging in a <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> slaughterhouse,'' said <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> McNiel </PERSON>, the <PERSON> Alvarado </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, Republican who tried to unseat <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> in 1986. `` It's the pork barrel capital of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' `` Pork barrel is an abused and grotesquely overused word,'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said in response. `` I think it's a sloppy word used indiscriminately to belittle projects that one does n't understand and from which one does n't benefit.'' Military spending makes up the greatest slice of <LOCATION> Tarrant </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>'s federal pie, with 83 percent of the $ 9.9 billion in funds received coming from defense contracts. The bulk of <LOCATION> Tarrant </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>'s $ 8.2 billion in defense contracts went to <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dynamics </ORGANIZATION>, maker of the F-16 jet fighter and the county's largest employer with 28,000 workers. The newspaper's analysis of federal spending in fiscal 1986 and 1987 used the <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>'s Consolidated Federal Funds Report, which tracks federal spending through 50 states, 3,041 counties and more than 80,000 local governments. Some federal defense funds traced to a particular county later are funneled to subcontractors in other counties, making it difficult to determine how much money a specific county keeps.

He was confirmed as party leader amid enthusiastic applause of more than 2,000 delegates. The delegates adopted a resolution endorsing a future `` great Arab Maghreb without frontiers.'' The congress unanimously backed <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION>'s membership in the proposed confederation of North African countries with <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mauritania </LOCATION>. The project has gained momentum since the recent reconciliation between <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>. Such a confederation was long blocked by the Algerian-Moroccan conflict over the disputed <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sahara </LOCATION>, but it became a practical possibility following the reconciliation in May between the two Arab neighbors. In addition, <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION> broke relations with <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION> following <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON>'s expulsion of more than 30,000 Tunisian workers in 1985, but the two neighbors patched up their differences late last year. To promote the planned confederation, <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> was due to begin a four-day visit to <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> Friday. The steps planned for the group include a joint identity card for the five participating nations. The party congress also confirmed <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> as party president. It thus ensured that it would retain its political preeminence, at least in the immediate future. <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON>, 52, a former army general and <PERSON> Bourguiba </PERSON>'s prime minister, seized power last Nov. 7 after seven physicians certified that the 84-year-old veteran leader was incapacitated by senility. <PERSON> Bourguiba </PERSON> formed the party he named the <ORGANIZATION> Constitutionalist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> more than 50 years ago to lead <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION> to independence from <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> in 1956. It was recently renamed the <ORGANIZATION> Constitutional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rally </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Bourguiba </PERSON> remains under closely guarded house arrest but has not been charged with a crime. At the congress opening Friday, <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> promised to maintain a `` balanced political liberalism'' based on political pluralism and a free enterprise economy. For the first time, leaders of the three legal opposition parties were invited to attend a governing party congress. Parliamentary elections are to be held in November. Presidential and legislative elections usually coincide in <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> is widely expected to run for election in November.

 A drug treatment facility named for <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is facing opposition from community leaders and homeowners who do n't want the center in a <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fernando </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> residential area. City Councilman <PERSON> Ernani </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernardi </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Supervisor <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonovich </PERSON>, who represent the area, said the center should n't be located at the former <ORGANIZATION> Lake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> View </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Terrace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> as planned. At a meeting Saturday, <PERSON> Antonovich </PERSON> urged formation of a committee to find an alternate site, saying, `` Placing a treatment center like this in a residential community is an inappropriate decision.'' The residential site is near an elementary school and a convalescent home. The center would treat 150 adolescents and 60 adults.

 <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s foreign minister said Sunday he sought assurances from Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> that new Kremlin policies on ethnic rights will protect Soviets of German origin. `` Germans residing in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> should have a chance to maintain their traditions, language, and also be in a position to worship,'' <PERSON> Hans-Dietrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> told a news conference.

 Officials decided Sunday to let blazing tank cars of alcohol derailed in a head-on freight train collision burn themselves out while some of the 1,000 evacuees returned home against authorities' advice. The crash killed two train crew members Saturday but two others jumped to safety before the collision. Officials of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> met for an hour with police Sunday and viewed the wreckage of one of the engines. `` We did not find anything out of order,'' said <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Dobranetski </PERSON>, who heads the six-member <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> investigating team. `` The emergency brake was being applied.'' Although evacuees were allowed to return, police tried to discourage them. `` We are telling them of the dangers and leaving it up to them,'' said <PERSON> Britt </PERSON> <PERSON> Adair </PERSON>, police chief in this suburb east of <LOCATION> Des </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Moines </LOCATION>. Mayor <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Burget </PERSON> said fires were burning up fuel faster than expected and that officials were making arrangements to have heavy equipment on hand Monday morning in hopes of beginning a cleanup. `` At this point, things are looking better all the time _ it looks good at this time. We're getting confident nothing is going to happen,'' he said. The fire involved two tank cars loaded with denatured alcohol. <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> McDole </PERSON>, chief of the <LOCATION> Polk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> sheriff's patrol, said the tank cars were still half full of alcohol Sunday evening and flames were shooting up 15 to 20 feet, half the height of the flames earlier in the day. After hazardous material experts examined the wreck Sunday, <PERSON> Adair </PERSON> said officials decided to simply allow the fire to burn until it ran out of fuel, a process which could take until late Monday. `` As long as we sit and watch it, we're in a safe situation,'' <PERSON> Adair </PERSON> said. `` If we try to mess with it we could be in trouble.'' Officials earlier had feared that a jammed pressure relief valve on one of the tanks could lead to an explosion, but <PERSON> Adair </PERSON> said the inspection revealed valves on both cars working. `` Pressure is being relieved on both tanks,'' he said. But he added: `` It's very dangerous, there's no question about it.'' <PERSON> Adair </PERSON> said said the crash and derailment left the two tank cars toppled but in a natural ravine which could deflect the impact of any explosion. `` Those two cars are bunkered down in a ditch,'' he said. The tank cars typically carry more than 20,000 of liquid, said <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Bacino </PERSON>, hazardous materials officer for <ORGANIZATION> Iowa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interstate </ORGANIZATION>, owner of both trains. <PERSON> Bacino </PERSON> said the fumes from raw denatured alcohol are toxic and explosive, but smoke from the burning alcohol is not hazardous. Security was tight at the scene. <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Winter </PERSON>, a part-time photographer for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, said Highway Patrol troopers confiscated his film after he slipped through barriers and took pictures of the wreckage. `` I saw one fuel tanker burning like mad,'' Winter said. `` It's a big burning mess. Rail officials said the eastbound train was pulling 78 cars, while the westbound train pulled eight. The eastbound train was headed from Council Bluffs to <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, while the westbound was a local freight going from <LOCATION> Newton </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Des </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Moines </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dobranetski </PERSON> would not speculate how two trains ended up on the same track headed in opposite directions. `` Drug testing will be done,'' he said. `` It's required by law.'' `` The safety board has declared this to be a major rail accident,'' he said. Police swept through the area after the crash Saturday evacuating residents, sending them to local churches and elementary schools for the night. Police cars and fire engines were scattered throughout this city of 5,700 keeping roads to the crash site sealed. Gov. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Branstad </PERSON> toured the scene Saturday night but was kept a mile away. At one church where evacuees were taken, <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> tried to keep tabs on his family and a pet. `` It's more inconvenient than anything else. We've got three little ones and we had to bundle them down here,'' he said. `` It's kind of exciting. Nothing ever happens in <LOCATION> Altoona </LOCATION>,'' said evacuee <PERSON> Janette </PERSON> <PERSON> Fagan </PERSON>.

 Two of the nation's leading manufacturers of heavy equipment head into contract talks this week, hoping to maintain the momentum of their recent recovery in the face of rising labor demands. <ORGANIZATION> Caterpillar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Deere </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, two Illinois-based giants with more than 30,000 union workers in seven states, will bargain with the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> to replace contracts expiring at midnight Sept. 30. Negotiations with <PERSON> Deere </PERSON>, the giant of farm tractor and agricultural implement manufacturing, begin way Wednesday at the company's <LOCATION> Moline </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION> headquarters. The following day, talks begin with Peoria-based <ORGANIZATION> Caterpillar </ORGANIZATION>, the world's leading maker of earth-moving equipment, at a <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis-area </LOCATION> hotel. At <ORGANIZATION> Caterpillar </ORGANIZATION>, the mood is one of cautious optimism. The company has slugged its way out of the economic doldrums, piling up $ 624 million in earnings in 1985-87 after absorbing unprecedented losses of $ 953 million in 1982-84. Earnings for the first six months of 1988 stood at $ 263 million on sales of $ 4.9 billion. But <ORGANIZATION> Caterpillar </ORGANIZATION> officials note that current profits are less than half the $ 1.6 billion in profits achieved in 1979-81 before the collapse. `` If you think happy days are here again, you're wrong,'' said <PERSON> Gil </PERSON> <PERSON> Nolde </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Caterpillar </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. `` We are n't back where we used to be.'' The Caterpillar talks affect 17,553 union workers at 12 cities in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Caterpillar </ORGANIZATION> employs nearly 59,000 people worldwide. Union workers are looking for a slice of <ORGANIZATION> Caterpillar </ORGANIZATION>'s growing profit pie, and say they deserve to be rewarded for helping the company reclaim its strong grip on the market from competitors like <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Komatsu </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Peoria </LOCATION> local 974, which represents more than 10,000 active <ORGANIZATION> Caterpillar </ORGANIZATION> workers and 1,000 on layoff, thinks workers deserve a merit raise `` Caterpillar is on the rebound,'' <PERSON> Green </PERSON> said. `` Things have turned around and they need to reward the people who are responsible for the profits _ the people in the shops. `` It's high time we had a raise other than a cost-of-living increase. We have n't had one since 1979. We've earned it after the years of sacrificing.'' <PERSON> Green </PERSON> wants to see a boost in the average blue-collar wages of $ 14.61 per hour, or $ 30,388 annually for a 40-hour week. With fringe benefits, <ORGANIZATION> Caterpillar </ORGANIZATION> calculates its current labor costs at $ 26 per hour for each employee. <PERSON> Green </PERSON> also wants a reduction in overtime, expansion of worker training programs and job-security agreements that were among the few gains the union claimed in the last two contracts. Those agreements resulted in frozen wages and cuts in bonuses. The 1986 talks were extended four times before a settlement was reached. The 1982 negotiations broke down and a record seven-month strike ensued as <ORGANIZATION> Caterpillar </ORGANIZATION> tried to convince the union it faced trouble after posting its best year ever in 1981 with profits of $ 579 million. The next three years were stained with red ink. Caterpillar closed nine plants and slashed its work force 40 percent, from nearly 88,000 to 53,600, in an effort to survive soaring interest rates, a strong <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar and fierce foreign competition in a stagnant marketplace. `` Nobody believed Cat was in dire straits,'' <PERSON> Green </PERSON> said. `` We were too content. Everyone suffered in the strike. We went through hell. We're not a bunch of strike-happy nuts because no one really wins. But we will strike if we have to.'' <PERSON> Deere </PERSON> still is trying to rebound from a five-month strike in 1986-87, the longest in the company's 151-year history. Already suffering from the prolonged farm recession, <PERSON> Deere </PERSON>'s earnings collapsed when socked by the strike, and the company lost $ 328 million in two years. The 163-day work stoppage at 13 Deere plants in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> ended Feb. 1, 1987, when union workers accepted a wage freeze, a one-time $ 735 payment each and creation of a job-protection plan. <PERSON> Deere </PERSON> earnings for the first half of fiscal 1988, which ended April 30, were $ 154 million on sales of $ 2.5 billion. Analysts disagree on the effects of the 1988 drought on Deere sales and earnings, but the issue is expected to come up during the contract talks. As with <ORGANIZATION> Caterpillar </ORGANIZATION>, the Deere talks also will focus on merit increases and job security. Both sides decline to talk in detail, but say they are confident they can achieve a settlement without a strike. `` We expect to reach an agreement that satisfies the requirements and <PERSON> Deere </PERSON> and its <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION> represented employees,'' said <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bart </PERSON> <PERSON> Bontems </PERSON>, director of industrial relations for the company. `` <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Auto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> shares the belief with <ORGANIZATION> Deere </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> that the discussions ... will be productive,'' <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hecker </PERSON>, international representative of the <ORGANIZATION> UAW </ORGANIZATION>. The average Deere factory worker makes $ 15.47 per hour and the company calculates its labor costs at $ 26.90 per hour, including vacation, bonuses, holidays and other fringe benefits. The current talks will affect about 13,400 active employees, and 4,000 laid-off workers, at 11 cities in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Deere </PERSON> employs about 38,000 employees worldwide.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and its brakemen say it may take an act of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to avert a strike idling Farm Belt boxcars and stranding thousands of commuters. And lawmakers, taking the threat seriously, are considering legislation to keep the trains rolling. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> is threatening to strike Thursday if C & amp; NW adopts new work rules eliminating jobs for 1,156 <ORGANIZATION> UTU </ORGANIZATION> brakemen. But neither side can act until a cooling-off period ordered by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> ends at 12:01 a.m. on Aug. 4. In his order _ which also blocked an April walkout and created an emergency board to intervene in the case _ <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said a strike against C & amp; NW could deprive several <LOCATION> Midwestern </LOCATION> states of essential rail service and disrupt normal business activity in the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> area, where 40,000 commuters use its trains daily. Negotiators for the company and Cleveland-based union met last Monday and Tuesday at <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mediation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> but suspended their talks after making no progress. `` For almost two years, we've been planning how we would operate in the event of a strike,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Foote </PERSON>, vice president of communications for <ORGANIZATION> CNW </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, the railroad's parent company. `` We're ready.'' `` They did n't get what they wanted, so they do n't intend to talk and intend to promulgate all the things they wanted on Aug. 4,'' <ORGANIZATION> UTU </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Hardin </PERSON> said. `` If they take that position, that leaves us no alternative but to peacefully withdraw from service.'' On July 1, the presidential emergency board proposed that C & amp; NW eliminate one brakeman per train and the other if approved by an arbitrator on a train-by-train basis. Both sides rejected the plan. <PERSON> Foote </PERSON> said it might take an act of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to bring a settlement _ a sentiment echoed by <PERSON> Hardin </PERSON>. But both sides spent last week lobbying vigorously against a bill introduced by Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Porter </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ill </LOCATION>., that would make the presidential board's recommendations binding unless the parties reach agreement without a The chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energey </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>'s transportation subcommittee, Rep. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Luken </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, said the measure would get prompt attention if there is no settlement by Thursday `` This would be a crippling strike for commuters and many agricultural interests, especially in these drought-stricken times,'' <PERSON> Luken </PERSON> said. `` It's premature for us to consider any action unless and until there would be a strike, but we intend to be in a position to move very quickly.'' The railroad operates on 6,400 miles of track with 8,000 employees in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nebraska </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>. It ranks eighth among <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> railroads in revenue, generating $ 893.5 million last year by moving 1.7 million carloads of freight. `` We've cut our work force, cut expenses and improved our productivity dramatically,'' <PERSON> Foote </PERSON> said. `` But because of competition and lower rates, our revenue per car has declined 26 percent since 1982.'' C & amp; NW wants to save $ 51 million a year by cutting most of its train crews from four to two people, eliminating what it considers unnecessary brakemen's jobs and leaving an engineer and conductor on board. `` We've made agreements in good faith with all the other carriers since the 1970s to cut down to one conductor and one brakeman on each crew and negotiate for the other brakeman,'' said <PERSON> Hardin </PERSON>, whose union represents both brakemen and conductors. `` If C & amp; NW were to win _ we have a strike and they're victorious _ then they'd have an unfair advantage over the other railroads.'' <PERSON> Hardin </PERSON> said he was not sure whether the <ORGANIZATION> UTU </ORGANIZATION> would extend a strike to other carriers, and he did not know if C & amp; NW employees from 15 other unions would walk off the job in sympathy. `` If it's a legal strike, our people would,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Shell </PERSON>, vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Brotherhood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Locomotive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineers </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>. `` That's a matter of personal choice, whether a member crosses their picket lines or not, but this organization traditionally has honored legal strikes.'' <PERSON> Foote </PERSON> said the company is ready if all its union workers walk out. `` About 80 percent of our management people have been given assignments that they will work if there's a strike,'' he said. `` We also have a pool of approximately 8,000 former railroad employees who will work.'' Commuter trains would halt for the duration of the strike. But <PERSON> Foote </PERSON> said management could operate enough trains from the first day of a walkout to maintain about 80 percent of the railroad's normal freight revenue, and replacement workers would be on the job within days

<HEAD>USW Tries Again For Democrat In White House</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steelworkers </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> convene their biennial convention Monday in <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> to take another crack at helping put a Democrat in the White House. `` There's no question about the support for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hubbard </PERSON>, aide to <ORGANIZATION> USW </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>. But the <ORGANIZATION> USW </ORGANIZATION> is not as populous as it used to be _ membership has tumbled from 1.4 million in 1976 to 650,000 now _ and there is debate about how much influence the union leadership exerts over its members. Furthermore, political analysts inside and outside the <ORGANIZATION> USW </ORGANIZATION> say the campaign organization of Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is not eager to wear a union label to the November election against Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> will address the <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> convention Thursday in person or by satellite video. The union will express its preference but will not formally endorse a candidate, <PERSON> Hubbard </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> USW </ORGANIZATION>'s contracts with most major steelmakers do not expire until next year, and a four-year pact with the biggest producer, <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION>, runs into 1890, leaving internal union business and presidential politics to dominate the convention. The <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION>, of which the <ORGANIZATION> USW </ORGANIZATION> is the 11th largest member, has told its member unions to defer endorsing <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> until the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION>'s general board makes its endorsement in late August. The umbrella organization's early endorsement of <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON> during the 1984 Democratic primary hurt the presidential candidate even before he faced <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, and neither <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> nor organized labor wants to repeat that mistake, said <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Fischer </PERSON>, a former assistant to four <ORGANIZATION> USW </ORGANIZATION> presidents and now director of labor studies at <ORGANIZATION> Carnegie-Mellon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` The people who did n't have the unions' backing ... had to tar <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON> as the candidate of special interests,'' said <PERSON> Fischer </PERSON>. `` When the Republicans do that you take it for granted. When the Democrats start doing that you start listening.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is `` trying to do this balancing rope job of on one hand having the leadership but on the other hand not allowing too close of an identification,'' <PERSON> Fischer </PERSON> said. But <PERSON> Hubbard </PERSON> disputed that an early endorsement by organized labor necessarily was harmful. `` We've seen no liability from early endorsement largely because we put forth such enormous energy in all the traditional activities to get out the vote. That includes phone banking and door knocking. The numbers prove the enormous participation of organized workers, particularly steelworkers, versus unorganized workers,'' <PERSON> Hubbard </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is appealing directly to members `` not through endorsements but through his support for traditional values,'' said <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Windt </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> communications </ORGANIZATION> professor and specialist in presidential rhetoric. <PERSON> Windt </PERSON> `` It's a very adroit strategy.'' Appealing directly to union members may be more effective anyway, <PERSON> Windt </PERSON> and <PERSON> Fischer </PERSON> said. `` The solidarity between the leadership and the rank and file ... does n't mean what it did back in the 1950s or 60s,'' said <PERSON> Windt </PERSON>. He cited the 1972 election, in which Gallup polls indicated 54 percent of families of labor union members voted for <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>'s re-election, while 46 percent voted for the Democrat, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> McGovern </PERSON>. `` That was a real crossover by the rank and file,'' <PERSON> Windt </PERSON> said. In 1968 <PERSON> Hubert </PERSON> <PERSON> Humphrey </PERSON> got 56 percent of the union families' votes against 29 for <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>, and the 15 percent that <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallace </PERSON> received `` was kind of a transition to <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>,'' he said <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> got 63 percent of their votes in 1976 versus 36 percent for <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>, and in 1980 union households gave President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> only 50 percent of their votes against 43 percent for <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and 5 percent for <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>. An <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> poll indicated 45 percent of union households voted for <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, and 54 percent for <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON> four years ago. `` It's like the deregulation of the rank and file. You've got the rank and file doing what they damn well please,'' <PERSON> Windt </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Economy Still Expanding In July, Purchasing Managers Say</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The nation's economy kept growing in July, although the pace slowed slightly from the previous month, according to a survey of corporate purchasing managers. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Purchasing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION>, which conducts a monthly survey of economic trends at more than 250 industrial companies, said its index of economic growth dipped to 59 percent in July from 59.3 percent in June. A reading above 50 percent indicates the economy is expanding, while levels below that point generally indicate the economy is contracting. Production growth slowed in July, although new orders expanded sharply, and inventories rose quickly, the group stated. `` The vigorous increase in new orders, undoubtedly fueled by the surge in export orders, is impressive and signals continued robust economic growth for the balance of the third quarter,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bretz </PERSON>, chairman of the group's business survey committee. Among the purchasing managers surveyed, 31 percent indicated their new orders had expanded, compared with 34 percent in June, while 12 percent said their rate of new orders was worse, the same as in June. Of the 70 percent of the group's members that export, 39 percent reported higher export orders during July, up from 38 percent in June, while only 3 percent said export orders were worse, the same as in the previous month. Production slowed for 13 percent, compared with 12 percent in June, and increased for 25 percent, down sharply from 35 percent in June. Inventories grew rapidly, with 22 percent of the purchasing managers reporting higher inventories, compared with 18 percent the previous month, and 18 percent reporting a slowdown in inventory growth, compared with 22 percent in June. The group said that accounting for normal seasonal variations, the rate of inventory increase was the greatest since July 1984. `` Some of the increase in inventory may be attributed to receiving products earlier than required from suppliers who closed their plants for vacation and maintenance and as a hedge against the significant number of price increases that went into effect July 1,'' the group stated. In other areas: _ Prices rose for the 22nd consecutive month, although the number of managers reporting higher prices declined Some 63 percent reported higher prices, compared with 66 percent in June, while 2 percent reported lower prices in both months. _ Employment rose for the second straight month after falling for three straight months Nineteen percent of those surveyed indicated their employment rose, compared with 20 percent the previous month, while 12 percent indicated employment fell, compared with 16 percent in June. _ Vendor deliveries slowed in July, a sign of economic growth that indicates demand for materials is outpacing manufacturers' ability to fill Some 21 percent indicated deliveries from their vendors had slowed, compared with 32 percent in June. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Purchasing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> is a trade organization representing 30,000 purchasing managers in 21 industries.

 <ORGANIZATION> Pullman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> has agreed to $ 650 million buyout by the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Forstmann </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Little </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, dropping an earlier agreement for a takeover by a managment-led group, <PERSON> Forstmann </PERSON> <PERSON> Little </PERSON> announced Sunday. The firm, which specializes in leveraged buyouts, stated it would pay $ 9.25 cash per share for <PERSON> Pullman </PERSON>'s 41.9 million outstanding shares, or about $ 387.57 million. Assumption of existing debt and expenses will make the total price of the buyout about $ 650 million, <PERSON> Forstmann </PERSON> <PERSON> Little </PERSON> stated. The buyout was conditioned on <PERSON> Pullman </PERSON> terminating its earlier agreement for a $ 7.75 per share buyout by a group led by <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Begel </PERSON>, the company's chairman and chief executive, and <ORGANIZATION> Henley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Pullman </PERSON>'s biggest shareholder with 9 percent of the company's outstanding shares. <PERSON> Pullman </PERSON> stock closed unchanged at $ 9 a share Friday on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. `` I am pleased that <PERSON> Pullman </PERSON>'s stockholders will get the benefit of the $ 9.25 transaction price and am confident that by being one of the <ORGANIZATION> Forstmann </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Little </ORGANIZATION> group of companies, new opportunities will be provided for <PERSON> Pullman </PERSON>'s employees,'' <PERSON> Begel </PERSON> said in a news release. <PERSON> Pullman </PERSON>, based in <LOCATION> Princeton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, is a diversified manufacturer of industrial and engineered component products, including truck trailers, aircraft seating, food service equipment, weapons systems components, refuse disposal equipment and fluid handling systems. `` The acquisition of <PERSON> Pullman </PERSON> is an opportunity for <PERSON> Forstmann </PERSON> <PERSON> Little </PERSON> to purchase a well-managed diverse group of industrial businesses, which have strong niche market positions,'' said <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Forstmann </PERSON>, a general partner of <PERSON> Forstmann </PERSON> <PERSON> Little </PERSON>. In a leveraged buyout, a company is acquired mainly with borrowed funds that are repaid with money raised by the target company's cash flow or the sale of its assets.

<HEAD>Official: Airbus Reforms Will Be Topic of September Meeting</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BONN, West Germany (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A top West German economic official said Sunday that reduction of government subsidies for <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industrie </ORGANIZATION> will be a main topic at a planned September meeting of the consortium's member nations in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Riedl </PERSON>, parlimentary state secretary for the <ORGANIZATION> Economics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, said in a radio interview that <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> also would push for the naming of a West German as financial director to oversee the consortium's expenses. The other Airbus nations are <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Riedl </PERSON> said reforms were necessary `` to ensure that aircraft production also remains competitive.'' <PERSON> Riedl </PERSON>'s comments came a day after West German Finance Minister <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Stoltenberg </PERSON> and Economics Minister <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Bangemann </PERSON> met to discuss subsidies to the Airbus program in the context of the proposed sale of aerospace holdings to industrial giant <ORGANIZATION> Daimler-Benz </ORGANIZATION>. Details of Saturday's talks were not released. <ORGANIZATION> Daimler </ORGANIZATION> wants to acquire a 30 percent holding in the <ORGANIZATION> Messerschmitt-Boelkow-Blohm </ORGANIZATION> aerospace group. Goverment officials said before the meeting that the talks were aimed at reducing the government's involvement in Messerschmitt's <ORGANIZATION> Deutsche </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION> division and to increase private industry's commitment to the national aerospace <ORGANIZATION> Deutsche </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION> is the West German participant in the <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industrie </ORGANIZATION> consortium. The West German government already has committed billions of dollars to <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION> already and wants to limit the amount of future subsidies. <PERSON> Stoltenberg </PERSON>, facing budget constraints, is eager to prevent additional costs. Furthermore, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials and aircraft makers have complained that the subsidies to <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION> amount to unfair competition and hurt <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> manufacturers, and are pressuring <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION> nations to limit their subsidies. <ORGANIZATION> Daimler-Benz </ORGANIZATION> is interested in expanding its aerospace activities, but wants protection against Airbus risks.
