 Democrats in this <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> territory decided Sunday to send an uncommitted delegation to the national convention in an attempt to have more political clout when the party selects its presidential nominee. `` The idea behind our uncommitted stance was to allow the <LOCATION> Guam </LOCATION> delegation to discuss Guam issues so more people could become aware of what we want,'' <PERSON> Daryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Taggerty </PERSON>, vice chairman of the party's delegate selection committee, said Sunday following the party's Topping the list of concerns in the territory's effort to become a commonwealth of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 A program Sunday on government-run television accused the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> news media of `` bias, hostility and missionary zeal'' in its reporting on <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. The 30-minute South African <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> program said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> media focused only on violence and black-white confrontation, ignoring positive developments. The program included interviews with officials from such <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> groups as the <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Hoover </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION>. No journalists working for American news organizations in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> appeared on the program. `` The <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> media simply are not going to give a fair shake to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Rusher </PERSON>, publisher of the conservative <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> journal <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Review </ORGANIZATION>. Program narrator <PERSON> Cliff </PERSON> <PERSON> Saunders </PERSON> said many foreign television organizations `` dash into <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, shoot a documentary in frantic haste, then dash home to tell a story which in no way reflects insight into the South African situation.'' The three largest American televison networks, <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>, all have permanent bureaus in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. `` But ignorance and haste are only part of the problem,'' <PERSON> Saunders </PERSON> said. `` Outright bias, hostility and a missionary zeal to discredit South African conditions are widespread.'' The program did not cite any inaccuracies reported in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> media and mentioned only two American news organizations by name, <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>. It showed brief footage from black townships that appeared in the <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> documentary, `` Children of Apartheid.'' The program aired in December. Minister of Home Affairs <PERSON> Stoffel </PERSON> <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> called the <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> program a `` blatant distortion that should be condemned with the contempt it deserves.'' <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> and his department monitor the South African and foreign news media under the nationwide state of emergency in effect since June 1986. The restrictions prevent journalists from reporting disturbances, security force actions and most forms of protest. All of the Americans interviewed agreed that the media crackdown has reduced <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> television coverage of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. `` The government has been remarkably effective in pushing <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> off the -LRB- <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> -RRB- evening news,'' said <PERSON> Stanford </PERSON> <PERSON> Ungar </PERSON>, a professor at <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>.

 President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> said Sunday she has no intention of allowing former President <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> to return to the country. `` I just want our people to know and to reassure them that I will never do anything that will go against the interests of the Filipino people,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> said during her weekly radio program `` Ask the President.'' She was responding to two women callers who said they were disappointed that she had sent emissaries early this year to meet with <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> has been living in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> since his regime toppled by a February 1986 revolt that swept <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> to power. One of the women said she was disappointed because of reports that government representatives were negotiating with <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> for his possible return. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s spokesmen had earlier denied the reports. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> told reporters in <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> last week that negotiations with Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s government were continuing and he was told he could return in two months to act as government adviser. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> said she sent two of her relatives to meet with <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> last January and February because she had heard his health was `` really deteriorating very fast'' and that he had a message for her. `` My directions to my relatives ... were very clear _ just to listen to what Mr. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> had to say,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> said. `` Never did I say that he could come back or that I wanted him to advise me and help me -LRB- find -RRB- the solutions to our problems. `` I think you also heard me say in the past that many of our problems were caused in fact by Mr. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>,'' the president added. Government officials have said Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> does not want <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> to return because his followers still are capable of plots to destabilize the government. Meanwhile, two gunmen fatally shot a bodyguard of the mayor of suburban <LOCATION> Makati </LOCATION> early Sunday outside the mayor's home, police said. Police quoted witnesses as saying the assailants shouted `` do n't interfere, we're the <ORGANIZATION> NPA </ORGANIZATION>,'' referring to the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peoples </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> Communist rebels have been waging a 19-year insurgency. The victim, <PERSON> Rodolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Abratique </PERSON>, was the second bodyguard of Mayor <PERSON> Jejomar </PERSON> <PERSON> Binay </PERSON> slain in the past week.

 <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said Sunday he would be willing to talk with those holding <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, and suggested that he would be more effective in winning their freedom that would his Democratic presidential rival, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has refused as a matter of policy to negotiate with hostage-takers. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said he would be willing to talk to anyone _ including the kidnappers. `` In this world, in this ambiguous world, you must not set up preconditions that stop effectiveness,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said at a rally in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` I would meet with anyone I could meet with to get the hostages out of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s remarks came in the final weekend of the <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> primary campaign, as he and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> set aside their best-friends campaign style. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> rejected as `` absurd'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s suggestion that he offer specific budget figures for programs he favors. Both candidates sounded jobs themes as they campaigned in this industrial state. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> talked about steel industry jobs and economic development during a whistle-stop train trip through the western half of the state. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> spent the night with an unemployed steelworker and his family in <LOCATION> Aliquippa </LOCATION>, preached at a local church and met with paperworkers in <LOCATION> Lock </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Haven </LOCATION> before flying to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is considered a sure bet to win most of the 178 Democratic convention delegations at stake in the <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> on Tuesday. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s best chance to make an impression would be in the non-binding preference vote that also will be part of Tuesday's ballot With 78 Republican delegates also at stake, Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> should reach the 1,139 total he needs to clinch the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> presidential nomination with a majority of the delegates to the Republican National Convention in August in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. `` Vote 12 times for <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>,'' said fliers being distributed to Democratic voters in the state's 2nd Congressional District. That appeal was not an invitation to vote fraud, but an effort to help voters understand the long and complex ballot that will confront them Tuesday. Democratic voters will elect delegates identified as supporters of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> or <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. For Republicans the task is even more difficult since the ballot will not identify the presidential preference of delegate candidates. The <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign was spending $ 25,000 on radio commercials that begin: `` On April 26 in the <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> primary, one vote for <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> wo n't be enough. If you want to help send <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> to the White House, you've got to vote for all the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> delegates in our area.'' The <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> campaign also was distributing fliers explaining to voters what they must do to support the former civil rights activist. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s delegate strength is concentrated in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> where the vast majority of the state's black voters live. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is expected to win most of the delegates in other parts of the state. Meanwhile, Democrats in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> territory of <LOCATION> Guam </LOCATION> decided Sunday that its six delegates _ representing three votes at the national convention _ will remain uncommitted in an attempt to have more political clout. `` The idea behind our uncommitted stance was to allow the <LOCATION> Guam </LOCATION> delegation to discuss Guam issues so more people could become aware of what we want,'' <PERSON> Daryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Taggerty </PERSON>, vice chairman of the party's delegate selection committee, said Sunday following the party's The <LOCATION> Guam </LOCATION> delegation includes former territorial Gov. <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bordallo </PERSON>, who was convicted of accepting bribes in exchange for government contracts but remains free pending appeal in federal courts. While <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> battled for Democratic delegates in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, conservative Republicans were trying to influence <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s selection of a running mate. <PERSON> Curt </PERSON> <PERSON> Clinkscales </PERSON>, a conservative activist, has formed an unauthorized committee to raise money to promote former <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> ambassador <PERSON> Jeane </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirkpatrick </PERSON> as the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential candidate. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Salter </PERSON>, a spokesman for Mrs. <PERSON> Kirkpatrick </PERSON>, said, `` She believes the decision on the vice president should be solely that of Vice President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>.'' The former <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> ambassador, a favorite of conservatives because of her hardline views on foreign policy, briefly considered getting into the presidential race, but finally decided against it. <PERSON> Clinkscales </PERSON> said he has raised $ 100,000 and collected the names of 1,400 volunteers. Through most of the <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> campaign, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> avoided any criticism of each other, concentrating instead on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. Their nice-guy approach was strained slightly Saturday night when they debated in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> chided <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for failing to attach price tags to his proposals. `` I'm not just for <ORGANIZATION> Head </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Start </ORGANIZATION>, I'm willing to pay for Head Start,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said during the debate. `` I have put numbers together to pay for my dreams.'' After the debate, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had failed `` to answer the budget question. ... I know it's good to project for a national health care plan, which I support. But it will cost.'' `` I do n't know what he's trying to do,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said Sunday when asked about the pressure from <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> to come up with budget figures. `` You ca n't prepare a budget now for next year,'' he told reporters on his campaign train. `` That's absurd.'' On the hostage question, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> criticized <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' stance that terrorists should not be negotiated with. `` I've raised the point in several debates this year,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said. `` Every time a question comes up about terrorism, Mr. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> says: ` I'm against terrorism ... We should not negotiate with terrorists. In the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, never negotiate with terrorists. Be tough.''' `` I disagree with that,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> went on. `` If I could get those hostages out, I would bring them back home.'' He said making a deal with kidnappers would be no worse than dealing with the likes of Panamanian strongman <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. `` We say now if <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> will come out of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, we'll send him to another country. That's a concession ... But the fact is, the object must be to free Americans who are held hostage in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>.'' Nine Americans are believed held by kidnappers in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. They are: <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Sutherland </PERSON>; <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON>; <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Cicippio </PERSON>; <ORGANIZATION> Edward </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Austin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tracy </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>; <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Polhill </PERSON>; <PERSON> Alann </PERSON> <PERSON> Steen </PERSON> and Marine Lt.

<HEAD>Bodies of Mother, Two Sons Found in Desert</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The bodies of a missing woman and her two sons were found Saturday in a desert wash more than a week after they disappeared, but officials said there was no evidence of foul play. The bodies of <PERSON> Penny </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON>, 26 and her 3-month-old son, <PERSON> Jeremy </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> were spotted at 8:45 a.m. Saturday by <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bernardino </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> sheriff's officials in a helicopter, Deputy <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Valencia </PERSON> said. The body of 4-year-old <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> was found about eight hours later, following an intensive search in driving, wind-whipped rain with temperatures in the low 40s, <ORGANIZATION> Valencia </ORGANIZATION> said. About 70 people using aircraft, horses, 4-wheel-drive vehicles and motorcyles searched the remote desert area until they found the boy's body about a mile south of his brother and mother. `` It looks like <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> turned around and headed back towards the car,'' <ORGANIZATION> Valencia </ORGANIZATION> said. Mrs. <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> and the boys were reported missing on April 13. The woman and her husband, <PERSON> John </PERSON>, had argued in the morning before she drove away with the boys, authorities said. `` We have no indication that there was a physical fight,'' <ORGANIZATION> Valencia </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> reported his wife and children were missing after Mrs. <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> failed to pick up her 6-year-old daughter from school. The <LOCATION> Barstow </LOCATION> woman's car was found on April 20, stuck in soft sand on an electrical company service road about 15 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Barstow </LOCATION>. Footprints led into the desert. The woman was wearing jeans and a shirt and was barefoot when she left. The boys were in their pajamas. `` They were not dressed for the weather,'' <ORGANIZATION> Valencia </ORGANIZATION> said. `` Even if someone were dressed for it, you could n't stay out there that long.'' The mother and children, who were identified Saturday by a deputy coroner, were found about 10 miles from the car. But coroner's officials refused to comment on how long the three had been dead or what caused their deaths. Autopsies had yet to be scheduled, <ORGANIZATION> Valencia </ORGANIZATION> said.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Weld </PERSON>, one of two top <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials who recently resigned, says federal laws should be revised to make it easier to charge state and local public officials with corruption and to include <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> members under all anti-corruption laws. <PERSON> Weld </PERSON>, who resigned March 29 as head of the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s criminal division, said in the opinion section column in <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> on Sunday that he would not discuss the reasons for his departure after two years in the department led by embattled Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> He wrote that the nation greatly underrates public corruption as a political and economic problem in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and said that corruption is a weed that will grow fast if left unattended, so legislation at the federal level is necessary. `` I, for one, believe that the federal government must take an active role in the fight against public corruption at all levels,'' he said. At a White House meeting on Wednesday, <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> and resigning Deputy Attorney General <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> painted a picture of a crippled department and an attorney general wracked by legal troubles, according to sources familiar with the half-hour meeting with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. Sources said <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> told the president that, if it were up to him, he would seek an indictment against <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> who has been the subject of a lengthy investigation by an independent counsel. In the <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> column, <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> said there must be a federal anti-corruption law to overcome the effects of last year's <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision which limited the ability of federal prosecutors to charge local officers with abuses of public trust. `` Another welcome step would be to apply all existing anti-corruption statutes to members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said, noting that only members of the executive branch and independent agencies are prohibited from supplementing their salaries with fees and honoraria for job-related activities. <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> said he found attractive the proposal to raise the salary of all members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to between $ 150,000 and $ 175,000 while prohibiting all honoraria. `` One big gain would be ruling out the possibility that fees or honoraria would influence a legislator's sense of priorities, let alone his or her vote,'' <PERSON> Weld </PERSON> wrote. `` Moreover, if members did not have to scramble to suport their families and two residences, they would have more time to devote to the public's business. `` Those higher salaries might also attract to the national legislature at least some able women and men who would not otherwise be able to make the sacrifice,'' he said. `` We should cleanse the system so as to attract them.''

 A boat builder was acquitted on Saturday for the second time of charges that he killed eight people aboard a fishing vessel in 1982, ending the longest and most expensive criminal case in <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> history. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Peel </PERSON>, 27, broke into tears and his family cheered when the jury announced its decision in <ORGANIZATION> Juneau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. He had been charged in the killing of eight peope aboard the fishing vessel Investor, which burned near <LOCATION> Craig </LOCATION> in September 1982. `` It's terrible being an innocent man accused of a crime,'' said Peel, of <LOCATION> Bellingham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION> `` I just thank God it's over. Justice did work this time.'' It was Peel's second trial on eight counts of murder and one count of arson. The first ended in a hung jury in <LOCATION> Ketchikan </LOCATION> in 1986. Peel, a boat builder who once was a crew member on the Investor, was accused of killing skipper <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Coulthurst </PERSON>, his wife, <PERSON> Irene </PERSON>, two Coulthurst children and four teen-age crew members. He was not arrested until two years after the crime. Prosecutor <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Henry </PERSON>, who handled both trials, told jurors the state had bungled the Investor investigation, had no motive and no physical evidence against Peel. But <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> contended the prosecution could prove its case based on witnesses who said they saw Peel near the Investor around the time of the killings and in the fishing vessel's skiff after the larger boat was found burning in a cove. Peel was working on another nearby fishing boat at the time. The state spent $ 2 million on the investigation and on Peel's first trial, which took six months The state budgeted $ 700,000 for the three-month retrial. It has been the longest and most expensive criminal case in the state's history. Jury deliberations began Wednesday evening. The jury forewoman said members of the panel had agreed not to talk to reporters. Peel had been in his parents' custody on a $ 1 million property bond since his arrest. His mother said the family will return to <LOCATION> Bellingham </LOCATION> `` as fast as we can get there.'' Defense attorney <PERSON> Phillip </PERSON> <PERSON> Weidner </PERSON> said the family is considering a lawsuit to seek restitution for the `` years of horror,'' but declined to say who might be the target of such a suit. <PERSON> Weidner </PERSON> contends if the first trial in <LOCATION> Ketchikan </LOCATION> had been handled correctly, Peel would have been acquitted there.

 Five years after a searing report called `` A Nation At Risk'' warned that American education was sinking beneath `` a rising tide of mediocrity,'' Education Secretary <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> says, `` we are still at risk.'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> in a new report said after five years of education reform efforts and higher spending, the nation's public schools have improved only marginally, the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> reported Sunday. `` Too many American students are not now getting the education they deserve,'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> wrote in the study requested by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. He said student achievement continues unacceptably low. The administration will mark the fifth anniversary of `` A Nation At Risk'' on Tuesday at the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> when <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> will give President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> his own assessment of how the schools are performing. The Bennett report said $ 56 billion more has been spent on public schools over the past five years and while there has been some progress, the improvement is `` at a disappointingly slow pace and still at excessively low levels of achievement.'' The education secretary lashed at teacher unions and other education organizations, saying their `` narrow, self-interested exercise of political power'' threatens school reform efforts. `` Whenever a worthwhile school proposal or legislative initiative is under consideration, those with a vested interest in the educational status quo will use political muscle to block reform,'' he wrote. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> added, `` And too often the anti-reformers succeed. If our schools are to improve, that power must be overcome.'' The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> will mark the anniversary with a protest Tuesday in <LOCATION> Lafayette </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> across the street from the White House. The union president, <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatwood </PERSON> <PERSON> Futrell </PERSON>, has charged school reform is `` withering on the vine'' due to lack of federal funds. An NEA flyer promoting the rally bears the headline: `` 1983: A Nation At Risk. 1988: An Administration Asleep.'' The first wave of school reforms involved top-down efforts by states to mandate stiffer course requirements and to impose tougher licensing requirements on teachers. The stick of accountability was often coupled with the carrot of big pay increases. Teacher salaries have climbed 35 percent since 1983, from an average of $ 20,693 to roughly $ 28,000. More recently, the push has been toward bottom-up reforms aimed at giving local teachers and school administrators more freedom to chart their own path toward better schools. A 1986 Carnegie task force laid the groundwork for creating a private, non-profit <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Professional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teaching </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standards </ORGANIZATION>, but it is still several years away from figuring out how to recognize outstanding teachers. <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> proposes a common academic curriculum for all students, more difficult course content and more challenging instruction in the lower grades and for minority and disadvantaged students. He also suggests changes in state rules to allow those without education degrees to become teachers and school principals. Some experts echo <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON>'s criticism that school reforms have had little impact on the worst problems. According to the <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> of the States, 45 states and the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> have raised graduation standards since 1980. In 1987, the average high school student had to take nearly 20 units of credit to graduate, up from 17 in 1980. But such groups as the <ORGANIZATION> Carnegie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> for the Advancement of Teaching and the <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> have concluded school reforms have had little or no impact on urban schools. The <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>, led by top business executives, said, `` Recent reform efforts have largely bypassed the problems of the educationally disadvantaged _ the 30 percent of children facing major risk of educational failure and lifelong dependency.'' The Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching said last month, `` The harsh truth is that the reform movement has largely bypassed our most deeply troubled schools.'' It said such prescriptions as more homework, more testing and more requirements for graduation were `` irrelevant to many children _ largely black and Hispanic _ in our urban schools.'' <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Shanker </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teachers </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` There's no evidence that reform is working for any of our kids, except for maybe the 20 percent who have always made it in the traditional school system.'' <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Honig </PERSON>, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s superintendent of public instruction, offers a far more upbeat view of what has happened since `` A Nation At Risk.'' <PERSON> Honig </PERSON> said <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> students are scoring higher on the Scholastic Aptitude Test as well as state exams and thousands more are taking three years of math and science. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> students passed 41,000 College Board Advancement Placement exams last year, up 73 percent from 1984. `` It has worked for many kids in inner cities. They're taking harder courses,'' said <PERSON> Honig </PERSON> and there has has been no jump in dropout rates, as some had feared. `` I'm not saying we're anywhere near where we have to be, but we're on the right track,'' said <PERSON> Honig </PERSON>. The original `` Nation At Risk'' report was the work of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Excellence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> in </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION>, a panel of 18 citizens appointed by then-Secretary of Education T.H. Bell in August 1981 to address `` the widespread public perception that something is seriously remiss in our educational system.'' The commission, headed by <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardner </PERSON>, called its provocative report an open letter to the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people. `` The educational foundations of our society are presently being eroded by a rising ride of mediocrity that threatens our very future as a nation and a people,'' it said. `` If an unfriendly foreign power had attempted to impose on <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> the mediocre educational performance that exists today, we might well have viewed it as an act of war.'' The commission recommended a longer school-year, competitive `` performance-based'' salaries for teachers, and minimum high school graduation standards of four years of English, three years each of math, science and social studies and a half-year of computer science. The commission members, but not <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION>, all have been invited to the White House for Tuesday's ceremony. <PERSON> Bell </PERSON>, in his memoirs, `` The Thirteenth Man,'' accused <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> of neglecting school reform after the 1984 election. In a recent interview, <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> said, `` We're doing a better job of educating the top 60 to 70 percent. ... -LRB- But -RRB- we've made no progress with respect to this bottom 30-40 percent _ the dropouts, minorities. `` The big push for school reform did n't do a darn thing to solve that.''

 Afghan rebels stormed and captured a strategic Soviet-Afghan garrison and opened a new, direct supply route for weapons, rebel spokesmen said Saturday. They said the garrison at <LOCATION> Barikot </LOCATION>, in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s northeast <LOCATION> Kunar </LOCATION> province, fell Friday at 1 p.m. after a four-month siege. Shortly before that, helicopters airlifted about five infantry and commando battalions, including a handful of Soviet advisers, from the installation, the rebels said. In <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, President <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> confirmed Sunday that guerrillas had captured the post, but he refused to call it a defeat. He characterized it as a `` change of positions of the army forces.'' The capture is a major victory for the anti-communist guerrillas fighting the Soviet-backed government. It opens a new supply route over the Pakistani border for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> and other Western weapons. The guerrillas said the operation was led by Commander <PERSON> Rahmatullah </PERSON> of the Hezb-I-Islami <LOCATION> Khalis </LOCATION> faction. <PERSON> Rahmatullah </PERSON> sent a radio message to guerrilla headquarters in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> saying the transmission was coming from inside Barikot. Before being airlifted, communist forces blew up a major ammunition dump inside the garrison, apparently to reduce the guerrilla's war booty, the spokesmen said. They said Soviet and Afghan jetfighters made high-altitude bombing raids while helicopter gunships escorted transport copters in and out of the garrison. Dozens of houses were destroyed in the air raids. One report said the garrison and a neighboring village were still being bombed Saturday afternoon. Rebel spokesman <PERSON> Qariburahman </PERSON> <PERSON> Saeed </PERSON> said Soviet-Afghan forces were trying to destroy <PERSON> Barikot </PERSON> rather than let it remain in guerrilla hands. He said 17 rebels had been killed and 16 wounded in the operation, but had no casualty figures for Soviet-Afghan troops. The attack on Barikot garrison is one of a dozen major military operations carried out by the guerrillas against the <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> government since the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> signed an agreement in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> April 14 to withdraw an estimated 115,000 Soviet troops from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. The guerrillas, who were not direct party to the accord, have vowed to continue fighting until the communist government is overthrown. The Soviets intervened in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in December 1979. Barikot lies just inside the Afghan border with northern <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>. For the guerrillas, the capture of Barikot would open a major supply route from <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s border town of <LOCATION> Arando </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s northeastern province of <LOCATION> Nuristan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kunar </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Arando </PERSON> is separated from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> by the <LOCATION> Kunar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> is a staging area for the <LOCATION> Afghan </LOCATION> resistance, although <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION> has pledged in the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> accord to stop serving as an arms conduit when the agreement goes into effect on May 15.

 The army on Sunday lifted a four-day ban that had barred Palestinians in occupied territories from traveling to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, a military spokesman said. It also permitted tankers to supply gas stations in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> for the first time in more than a month. Soldiers lifted a six-day curfew in more than a dozen towns and refugee camps on Sunday, permitting thousands of Arabs to reach their jobs in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, the spokesman said. But the military said curfews would be imposed for a seventh straight day on three towns in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and a refugee camp in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> in an effort to quell unrest that has followed the April 16 assassination of <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Khalil </PERSON> <PERSON> Wazir </PERSON> at his home in a <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION> suburb.

 Gunmen believed to be Sikh militants shot and killed 13 people in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> on Sunday, prompting a police alert across the northern Indian state, news reports and police said. Sunday's slayings brought the death toll blamed on <ORGANIZATION> Sikh </ORGANIZATION> radicals to at least 30 since Friday. The killings also triggered tightened security measures in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>, where police began checking vehicles. Several road blocks were erected in the city of six million people. `` We have reports that Sikh terrorists may try to create public disorder in the capital, hence the measure,'' said an officer at the police control center. <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> said that suspected Sikh militants shot and killed 13 people, including a <ORGANIZATION> Sikh </ORGANIZATION> woman in six separate attacks in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> state on Sunday. Among the dead were seven Sikhs and three Hindus. No other details were available. Sikh radicals, who are campaigning for an independent homeland in their rich farming state, were blamed for 12 deaths in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> on Friday. On Saturday, five more people died in Sikh radical attacks. The latest killings raised to 807 the number of deaths blamed on <ORGANIZATION> Sikh </ORGANIZATION> militants in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> state since the start of the year.

 An Iranian gunboat rocketed a Saudi Arabian-owned tanker in the Strait of Hormuz Sunday, hours after President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> warned <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> to stop attacking neutral ships in the region, <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> shipping sources said. The tanker, which sustained minor damage, made for the southern port of <LOCATION> Dubai </LOCATION> with an unexploded rocket hanging from its punctured site. But the captain said that the missile fell overboard when the tanker docked. He reported no explosion. Gulf-based shipping executives, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the 37,011-ton Sea Trader was approached by a swarm of six gunboats as it sailed northward through the strait, gateway to the gulf. But they said only one Iranian boat took part in the attack. The tanker's Indian skipper, Capt. B.R. <PERSON> Pagarkar </PERSON>, reported that his ship was only slightly damaged with no casualties among his Indian crew, the officials said. The shipping officials quoted <PERSON> Pagarkar </PERSON> as saying he saw six speedboats heading in his direction as the tanker was entering the gulf to take on a cargo of oil at the <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> port of <PERSON> Ras </PERSON> <PERSON> Tanura </PERSON>. `` Five then went in one direction, while one appeared to be heading for another tanker, and I thought we'd escaped an attack. But suddenly, it veered toward my ship,'' <PERSON> Pagarkar </PERSON> said. The Iranians demanded the Sea Trader's destination and were preparing to board, when `` suddenly, they began firing with shoulder-carried guns. They must have fired 10 to 12 rockets,'' the captain said. `` I had no fire and no injuries, and so when I saw that I did n't require assistance, I just proceeded,'' he said The tanker flies a Liberian flag but is owned by the <ORGANIZATION> Bakri </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navigation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Jiddah </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> warned Saturday that further Iranian attacks on shipping `` will be very costly to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and its people.'' The raid was the first Iranian attack on a neutral merchant ship since Monday, when Iranian gunboats attacked several vessels during a series of clashes with the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> last Monday. The battles began when the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warships blasted two offshore Iranian oil platforms the Americans said also were used as bases for Iranian attacks on ships in the so-called `` tanker war,'' a spillover from the 7 -LCB- - year-old Iran-Iraq war The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> also disabled two Iranian frigates and sank or disabled four other armed Iranian vessels. The platforms were hit in what the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> termed a `` measured response'' for damage to the guided missile frigate USS <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> when it hit an Iranian mine April 14. Ten of the frigate's crewmen were wounded by the mine blast in a channel used by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> to escort U.S.-flagged commercial vessels to and from <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have disclosed that American warships in the gulf will now be allowed to go to the aid of neutral vessels under attack. Previously, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> was not permitted to intervene in raids on non-American vessels. However, spokesmen for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> said they knew of no <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intervention Sunday to help vessels under attack in the gulf.

 Pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem extremists threatened Sunday to kill two American hostages if <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warships in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> launch new attacks on Iranian targets. The threat was contained in a handwritten statement signed by the <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionarey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> and delivered to the <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> office of a Western news agency. Revolutionary Justice holds <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Cicippio </PERSON>, 57, of <ORGANIZATION> Valley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forge </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Austin </PERSON> <PERSON> Tracy </PERSON>, 57, of <LOCATION> Burlington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vermont </LOCATION>. They are among the 22 foreign hostages held in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The conservative ad-Diyar newspaper reported earlier Sunday that a deal to free three French hostages held by another <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> faction fell through when the kidnappers reneged on pledges to release them because the hijackers of a Kuwaiti airliner were still in <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION>. Kuwaiti officials said when the Algerians negotiated an end to the 16-day hijack drama Wednesday the <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> hijackers left the plane on condition they were given safe passage to another country. Sunday's <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> statement was accompanied by a photograph of <PERSON> Cicippio </PERSON>, the acting comptroller at the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beirut </ORGANIZATION> who was kidnapped Sept. 12, 1986. `` Any new -LRB- <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> -RRB- aggression under any pretext or excuse will lead to the execution of spy <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Tracy </PERSON> first and <PERSON> Cicippio </PERSON> secondly,'' the Arabic-language statement said. Another Western news agency received a photocopy of a membership card of an unidentified Lebanese organization bearing <PERSON> Tracy </PERSON>'s photograph to authenticate the statement <PERSON> Tracy </PERSON>, a writer of children's books, was kidnapped Oct. 21, 1986. `` The attacks occurring in the gulf will not go unpunished and will not be as easy as <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> assumes and defines the beginning and the end of the aggression,'' the letter said. The letter said that if <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attacks continued one option would be to move `` the battle arena to inside <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, after which things will get out of control.'' It did not elaborate. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> disabled two Iranian frigates and sank or disabled four other armed Iranian vessels in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> last Monday. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said the attack was in retaliation for the mine strike on an <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> frigate that left 10 crewmembers injured.

<HEAD>Iran-Contra: Conflict Between Fair Trial and National Security</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A judge's decision to give defendant <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON> access to classified documents in the Iran-Contra case spotlights the dilemma of ensuring a fair trial while protecting the nation's secrets. Since <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON> has never been granted a security clearance, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gesell </PERSON>'s recent decision made clear that fairness takes precedence over normal security rules in a criminal trial. The judge gave all four defendants access to 300,000 classified documents to prepare for trial, although anyone in the case faces stiff penalties for unauthorized disclosure of material in the documents. But <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON>'s case is the best example of the problem, because his background is so different from those of the other defendants. <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> North </PERSON>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> all are former military men with wide experience in handling secret documents and covert operations. But <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON> is a businessman of Iranian heritage, who told the Iran-Contra congressional committees, `` As a businessman, I never pretended to undertake these activities for philanthropic purposes.'' <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubino </PERSON>, director of security for the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` It does present a problem whenever we ca n't do traditional background checks'' for security clearances. <PERSON> Rubino </PERSON> said he ca n't recall any previous case where such broad access to classified information was granted to someone without a clearance. Normally, he said, `` The indictment makes it inappropriate to say this person is trustworthy.'' The Iran-Contra indictment alleges a broad conspiracy to misuse a lawful presidential order allowing the secret sales of arms to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. The conspirators are accused of using money from the sales to aid the Nicaraguan Contra rebels when such assistance was banned, to generate illegal profits for private gain, and to cover up their activities. North was a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> staff member; his boss was former national security adviser <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>; <PERSON> Secord </PERSON> is a former <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> major general turned private businessman and <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON> was <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>'s business partner. As an <ORGANIZATION> NSC </ORGANIZATION> staffer, <PERSON> North </PERSON> generated many of the classified Iran-Contra documents that he will see in the case; so did <PERSON> Poindexter </PERSON>, who routinely briefed the president on national security matters and therefore had vast knowledge of the nation's secrets <PERSON> Secord </PERSON>, who became <PERSON> North </PERSON>'s key private sector operative, had held sensitive Pentagon jobs. He once was in charge of international security matters and reportedly helped plan an unexecuted Pentagon mission to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in 1980, when 52 Americans were held hostage at the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> embassy there. <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Barcella </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, a former assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> who specialized in anti-terrorism prosecutions, said <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration officials `` probably are very edgy about letting <PERSON> Hakim </PERSON> see it -LRB- the classified information -RRB-.'' But he added, `` The problem is, that was the choice the -LRB- independent counsel -RRB- knew about before he indicted him.'' The government has decided on occasion against bringing charges in some espionage or anti-terrorism cases so it would n't risk disclosure of classified information, <PERSON> Barcella </PERSON> said. But far worse for the government was `` graymail,'' a form of blackmail used by those threatening to expose classified information if indicted. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' answer was passage in 1980 of the Classified Information Procedures Act, which sets up rules for handling classified information in criminal trials. The law allows the judge to take swift retribution against unauthorized disclosures, by finding a violator in contempt and jailing him or her immediately. In return for the swift contempt penalty that protects the government's information, the defense is assured the access it needs to present its side. `` The act was structured to equalize the status of a defendant regardless of whether he has a security clearance,'' said <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Adler </PERSON>, a legislative counsel of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>. `` No one should have an advantage. What <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> intended was that a criminal defendant's ... right -LRB- to a fair trial -RRB- should not be impaired by the fact that information relating to the charges is classified.'' The act requires the defendant to notify the court and the prosecution if it plans to use classified documents in the case. The court has discretion to work out alternative procedures that could keep the documents secret, while allowing the trial to continue. For instance, there could be a government statement admitting relevant facts that the specific classified information would tend to prove. There could be a summary of the information. And if a defendant is prevented by the judge from using classified information he needs for his defense, the court has three choices: it can dismiss the indictment in whole or in part, strike certain prosecution testimony, or rule against the prosecution on any issue where the information would be relevant.

<TEXT>
 The passage of <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>'s new law banning cheap handguns stems in part from an epidemic of drug-related killings, but it also owes a lot to a state senator's embarrassment at a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> party. What embarrassed state <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> also made him a center of attention, and that led to a meeting with a woman who is a driving force in the move for gun control legislation. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>'s secretary misread an invitation to a <ORGANIZATION> Gridiron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> event last year as saying white attire was required, instead of white tie, so <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> was the only one who showed up in a white tuxedo. He was approached by <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, wife of presidential press secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, who was severely injured in the 1981 assassination attempt on President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. `` It was unbelievable,'' recalled <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>. `` There I was red-faced, standing 15 feet from President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> comes over and tries to make me feel at ease. She told me I was the only thing adding any pizazz to the party.'' They met again a few weeks ago when Mrs. <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, who has become active in the fight for gun control legislation, asked for <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>'s help in pushing a bill that would outlaw the sale and manufacture in <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> of cheap handguns commonly known as Saturday Night Specials `` I was impressed with her and when I was given the opportunity to help it was the least I could do for her,'' he said. The law, which Gov. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Schaefer </PERSON> has promised to sign, will require a nine-member state board to draw up a list of acceptable handguns. Those not on the list would be banned in <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, and violators would be liable for stiff fines, up to $ 10,000 for each illegal gun sold or manufactured. The ban wo n't go into effect until January 1990, giving the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rifle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> a chance next year to try to have it repealed. <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> officials have vowed to make such an attempt. While four other states have laws that ban cheap guns based on the melting point of a weapon's metal, the <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> measure is considered by its supporters to be much broader. They hope it will be used as a model by other states. Gun control advocates also see the <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> experience as a useful political primer in how to withstand the powerful NRA. `` <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> was absolutely crucial,'' said Del. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Franchot </PERSON>, one of a cadre of lawmakers who pushed the bill through the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Delegates </ORGANIZATION>. `` He just stood up for the gun-control bill and stared down the <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Franchot </PERSON> said. `` We just sat back there in awe at the way <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> pushed the thing through. We would have been nowhere without the political muscle of the president.'' <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> acknowledged the role played by Mrs. <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>'s personal lobbying, but said a more important factor was the attitude of the <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> itself. `` The very fact that they were opposed to -LRB- banning -RRB- guns that could go past metal detectors turned off a great many legislators,'' he explained. `` The fact that they were opposed to banning tin and plastic guns that sell for $ 29.95 whose sole purpose is to kill, that told the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maryland </ORGANIZATION> that they were n't interested in a reasonable compromise.'' Agreeing with that analysis was <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Beard </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> to Ban Handguns: `` The <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION>, I think, just blew it. They were too arrogant.'' <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, <PERSON> Franchot </PERSON> and <PERSON> Beard </PERSON> also agreed that the recent rash of shootings by teen-agers hooked into the drug trade in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> and metropolitan <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> was a crucial factor. Credit also was given to effective personal lobbying by <PERSON> Coretta </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, wife of slain civil rights leader <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, and other victims of violence. <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Lattanzio </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION>'s director of state and local affairs, cited those and other factors for creating an `` emotional hysteria'' that made passage possible. `` It was a concerted effort by the governor, other political leadership, gun-control groups and the media that steamrolled an unfortunate law, which deludes the public into thinking it will have an impact on crime, which it wo n't,'' <PERSON> Lattanzio </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Double Agent Interviewed For First Time On Soviet Television</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Soviet spymaster <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Blake </PERSON> said in his first television interview that he has had an `` amazingly good'' life in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> since he escaped from a <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> prison more than 20 years ago. `` Gradually, I got to make some friends, I met my wife, I found a very interesting job with interesting and pleasant colleagues. Then my son was born, and my life took a very happy course,'' the Dutch-born <PERSON> Blake </PERSON> told Soviet television in an interview broadcast Saturday. The broadcast was monitored by the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Blake </PERSON>, a British subject, was convicted in 1962 of spying for the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> while working in British intelligence. His celebrated case brought a 42-year jail term, one year for every British agent the prosecution claimed he betrayed to their deaths. The spymaster escaped from jail in 1966, and the <ORGANIZATION> Sunday </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> newspaper said last October he was aided by two leaders of the British anti-nuclear movement. `` Being faced with such a long term of imprisonment makes a man want to do something about it,'' <PERSON> Blake </PERSON>, 65, said on the late-night Soviet television program `` Before and After Midnight.'' `` And I was very lucky in that there were some good people who sympathized with me, people inside and outside of jail, and who were ready to help me.'' <PERSON> Blake </PERSON> said he hid for a few days in an apartment near the Wormwood Scrubs Prison, moved to another apartment further away and after two months was smuggled to <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> in a van. `` And that's how I go to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>,'' he said. He said his adjustment to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> was not easy. `` It was for me a different country, different traditions, and even a different society, so of course it was difficult.'' As he acquired a family and got a good job, which he did not identify, <PERSON> Blake </PERSON> said, `` My life has been amazingly good, beyond all my expectations.'' News reports in 1971 said <PERSON> Blake </PERSON> was receiving first-class treatment in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, owning a car and vacationing at <LOCATION> Black </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> resorts. The Soviet television announcer introduced <PERSON> Blake </PERSON> as `` an honorary member of the state security service who has been awarded the Orders of <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON> and the Combat Red Banner.'' The announcer described him as an `` outstanding Soviet secret servicemen.'' After his jail escape, <PERSON> Blake </PERSON> lived secretly in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> until an interview with him appeared Feb. 14, 1970, in the Soviet government newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION>. In that interview, <PERSON> Blake </PERSON> said he became a spy for the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to help in `` exposing and interferring with imperialist aggression and subversion.'' Among his exploits was to betray a British spy ring in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> and a tunnel there which the American <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> and British MI-6 used to monitor <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> communications. During the 12-minute television interview, <PERSON> Blake </PERSON> spoke about his work in the Dutch resistance during World War II, his 1942 flight to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, where he joined the British secret service and his conversion to Communism after studying the works of <PERSON> Marx </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON>. <PERSON> Blake </PERSON> was the second British-Soviet double agent interviewed recently by Soviet television. Other broadcasts have focused on <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> `` Kim'' <PERSON> Philby </PERSON>, 76, a former <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> intelligence officer who defected to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in 1963.

In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>, police checked vehicles and set up several road blocks because of the killings. `` We have reports that Sikh terrorists may try to create public disorder in the capital, hense the measure,'' said an officer at the police control center of this city of 6 million. <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> said Sunday's killings came in six separate attacks. Among the dead were seven Sikhs, including one woman, and three Hindus. Identities of the remaining three were not immediately known. Sikh radicals, fighting for an independent homeland in their rich farming state, were blamed for 12 deaths in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> on Friday. On Saturday five more people died in Sikh radical attacks. The latest killings raised to 807 the number of deaths blamed on <ORGANIZATION> Sikh </ORGANIZATION> militants in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> state since the start of the year.

 The Arab uprising has cast a shadow over <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s yearlong 40th anniversary bash, with <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> director <PERSON> Woody </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, poet <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Ginsberg </PERSON> and tennis ace <PERSON> Chris </PERSON> <PERSON> Evert </PERSON> among celebrities who turned down invitations. Israeli organizers hope to stem the wave of cancellations by assuring reluctant guests that the <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> conflict will be a central theme and that they are free to criticize <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Some Israelis consider the no-shows another slap in the face to a nation that throughout its short history has often found itself isolated and a target of international criticism. But others said they wo n't let it spoil the party. `` You have seen the people of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> truly rejoice, going out for picnics, going out into the streets,'' said Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s aide, <PERSON> Avi </PERSON> <PERSON> Pazner </PERSON>, referring to last week's Independence Day celebrations `` Nobody can take that away.'' Organizers said many big names remained on the guest list, including American movie director <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wise </PERSON> and Indian-born <PERSON> Zubin </PERSON> <PERSON> Mehta </PERSON>, conductor of both the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> Philharmonic orchestras. Israeli organizers had planned an impressive lineup of poetry readings, film festivals and theater performances as highlights of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s 40th anniversary celebration. But in the midst of preparations, the Arab uprising erupted five months ago, and televised images of <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers clubbing Arab youths and razing houses sparked an international outcry. More than 170 Arabs and two Israelis have died in the unrest. `` We are in a war, and it hurts everything, our celebration, our economy, tourism, our feelings,'' said <PERSON> Yakov </PERSON> <PERSON> Agmon </PERSON>, the chief coordinator of the anniversary festivities. <PERSON> Agmon </PERSON> suffered a major setback last week when five <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> poets organizing one of the main events, the `` International Poetry Week,'' withdrew their support and called on fellow artists to boycott the June festival. `` A government that demolishes civilian houses ... and kills youths in what can only be termed state terror is not worthy to have poets come to a government-sponsored festival,'' said <PERSON> Natan </PERSON> <PERSON> Zach </PERSON>, a founding father of modern Hebrew poetry who lives in <LOCATION> Haifa </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Agmon </PERSON> initially wanted to cancel the festival, but then asked his staffers to poll the invited poets _ 80 Israelis and 35 foreigners _ to see if there was enough support to go ahead. He said he would make a decision later this month. He would not give names of poets who turned down invitations, but two of the most prominent, <PERSON> Ginsberg </PERSON> and Soviet poet <PERSON> Yevgeny </PERSON> <PERSON> Yevtushenko </PERSON>, said they would not attend. <PERSON> Ginsberg </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> he initially accepted, hoping to use the festival as a `` protest for peace,'' but later withdrew in solidarity with <PERSON> Zach </PERSON>'s decision. Organizers of other festivals also said many international artists were torn about whether to attend. `` We got a lot of letters from film directors who said, ` how can we come to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and talk about movies when people get murdered?''' said <PERSON> Nili </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the weeklong <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Student </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Film </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Festival </ORGANIZATION>, scheduled for May. Ms. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said organizers had asked 150 film schools to submit contributions, and 45 accepted while 50 of the refusals cited political reasons. To overcome such reservations, organizers decided on a 32-hour retrospective of films on the <LOCATION> Arab-Israeli </LOCATION> conflict, which has become the centerpiece of the festival. As a result, several prestigious contributors, including the <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Film </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, agreed to attend. `` They now have a feeling that they're not just coming to talk about art, but to get involved,'' Ms. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said. But others, like <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, turned down the invitation. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> did not give a reason, but Ms. <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> suggested his refusal was politically motivated. Earlier this year, <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, who is Jewish, sharply criticized army policies in a letter to <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Evert </PERSON> and fellow tennis star <PERSON> Brad </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> pulled out of a May tennis benefit tournament for <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Shaare </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zedek </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>. `` Ms. <PERSON> Evert </PERSON> decided to withdraw mainly because of the political problems,'' said hospital spokesman <PERSON> Rami </PERSON> <PERSON> Sadan </PERSON>, who canceled the tournament. Some entertainers have chosen another way. Theatre <PERSON> du </PERSON> <PERSON> Soleil </PERSON>, a Paris-based avant-garde troupe, agreed to attend this summer's <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> Festival, an annual performing arts extravaganza, after telling organizers it would first publish a statement about its political views in Israeli newspapers. In the half-page ad published April 15 in the <ORGANIZATION> Jerusalem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> newspaper, the group described the Arab uprising as justified, but also asserted <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right to exist in peace and security. <PERSON> Pazner </PERSON> said he opposed attempts to encourage political debate to assuage the liberal conscience of VIPs. `` It is wrong to turn a national celebration into a political event,'' <PERSON> Pazner </PERSON> told The <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION>. `` The <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> people want to rejoice without politics.'' He lashed out at local artists criticizing <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, calling them `` a small minority of pseudo-intellectuals who believe self-hatred is the answer to the problems of the Jewish people.'' Countered Zach: `` He is probably right if he means by self-hatred that we are having problems with our conscience.''

 The assassination of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s No. 2 leader may have been aimed at scuttling <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace efforts, and a breakdown could lead to a disaster, King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> said in a rare interview broadcast Sunday. <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> condemned the April 16 killing in <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION> of <PERSON> Khalil </PERSON> <PERSON> Wazir </PERSON>, military head of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, which he said was `` more than likely'' carried out by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. Israeli sources have said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> was behind the attack, but the government has not confirmed it. `` I think it will probably mean that tensions in the area will grow more and conceivable it could be an action in itself which is aimed at creating the kind of reaction that would destroy the chances for progress towards peace,'' <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> said on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s Sunday Today. `` Sticks and stones and tear gas -LRB- are -RRB- causing a lot of damage ... but this area has nuclear weapons within it,'' he said. `` If there is no solution, the end is an explosion, a disaster. ... I could see a disaster overtaking all of us ... sooner or later.'' Palestinian rioting in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, which <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> captured from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war, and in the Israeli-occupied <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> taken from <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> in the same conflict, has left more than 170 Arabs and two Israelis dead. <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>, in the interview taped Thursday, also said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is not doing enough to promote peace. When asked if he trusted the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as mediator, he said: `` I have no reason to do so, so far. It's not a question of trust. It's a question of is the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> willing to ... assume the responsibilities of a superpower in its position.'' He said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> `` has a moral right'' to push <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> toward a peace settlement. He also called on <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to rally the five-member <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, which includes the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, behind a peace initiative.

 The scene: <PERSON> Mel </PERSON> <PERSON> Krupin </PERSON>'s restaurant, a favorite watering hole of the city's power-brokers. The occasion: A Hanukkah-Christmas luncheon hosted by <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>, Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s longtime friend. The Nov. 30, 1983, party, thrown by <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> five years before his indictment on racketeering charges, attracted about 25 people, including <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Ursula </PERSON>; <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Wick </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Sondra </PERSON> <PERSON> Bender </PERSON>, wife of local real estate magnate <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bender </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Berendzen </PERSON>, the president of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` Bob seats me between two of my trustees: <PERSON> Sondra </PERSON> <PERSON> Bender </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ursula </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Berendzen </PERSON> recalled in his book, `` Is My Armor Straight? A Year in the Life of a University President.'' Both women serve on the school's board. The Benders, well-known in the capital's social circles, are part of a wealthy family that has created a real estate empire by constructing and leasing buildings for the federal government and private concerns. The Benders and the Meeses crop up frequently in <LOCATION> Berendzen </LOCATION>'s book, written in the form of a diary Recently, the two couples have been brought together in another way: they have testified before a federal grand jury investigating Mrs. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>'s $ 40,000-a-year job at the <ORGANIZATION> Multiple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sclerosis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, paid for with a grant from the <ORGANIZATION> Bender </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, the family's philanthropy Mrs. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> and Mrs. <PERSON> Bender </PERSON> are both on the MS society's board, too. <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, has said <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> had a peripheral role in finding the job for Mrs. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>. After Mrs. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> started her job in January 1986, a <PERSON> Bender </PERSON> partnership signed a $ 50-million lease on a building for <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> workers. Independent counsel <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> is scrutinizing the job and the real estate deal as part of his inquiry into whether <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> violated any conflict-of-interest laws covering his personal financial dealings and his job. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> has denied any wrongdoing, and said he knew nothing about the <PERSON> Bender </PERSON>'s lease until he read about it in a newspaper April 14. <ORGANIZATION> Blake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Construction </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the Benders' company, was awarded $ 120 million in construction contracts in 1987, according to a survey of the top 400 construction companies in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The firm ranked number 181. ENR, a <ORGANIZATION> McGraw-Hill </ORGANIZATION> magazine, conducted the survey. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bender </PERSON>, the patriarch, founded <PERSON> Blake </PERSON> in 1945. His three sons were involved in the company when he died in 1966. In 1978, <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> and <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Bender </PERSON>, two sons, had net worths of $ 24 million and $ 23 million, respectively, according to records cited by <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION>. The net worth of the third son, <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Bender </PERSON>, was not available. Blake-built buildings dot the city's landscape: The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> building, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Claims </ORGANIZATION>, the executive office buildings across from the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, to name a few. Government records show the Benders and their firm often enter into partnerships with others to do business. Over the years, <PERSON> Bender </PERSON> family members have had their share of problems with the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, and their companies have been embroiled in legal disputes over contruction contracts. One pending case involves <ORGANIZATION> Blake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Construction </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 44 million contract awarded by the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> in June 1984 to build the Trident Training Facility at the submarine base at <LOCATION> Kings </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> terminated the contract on Dec. 12, 1986 because of `` numerous instances of non-conforming work, safety violations and labor standards provisions violations,'' a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> document said. <PERSON> Blake </PERSON> has appealed the ruling to the <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Contract </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION>. No date has been set for a hearing, chairman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said. The Benders and <PERSON> Blake </PERSON> also show up on records at <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tax </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. In 1987, a dispute was settled when <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sondra </PERSON> <PERSON> Bender </PERSON> agreed to pay $ 77,387 in additional taxes; <PERSON> Blake </PERSON> agreed to a $ 648,840 payment in 1983 to resolve a dispute. Nine years ago, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported a grand jury in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, conducted a tax probe of the financial empire of <PERSON> Blake </PERSON>'s owners, <PERSON> Morton </PERSON>, <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> and <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Bender </PERSON>. <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> <PERSON> Bender </PERSON>, who no longer has a management role at <PERSON> Blake </PERSON>, said no charges were ever brought against the company. Besides real estate, the <PERSON> Bender </PERSON> family owns <ORGANIZATION> WWDC </ORGANIZATION>, a rock-and-roll radio station where Mrs. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> tried out _ but did n't accept _ a position as a public affairs commentator Mrs. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> went on the payroll at the MS society in January 1986 after declining the radio job. The money she gets comes from the <ORGANIZATION> Bender </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sondra </PERSON> <PERSON> Bender </PERSON> are active on the party circuit and donate large amounts of money to charity, but they do not court publicity, acquaintances say. They declined to be interviewed, and referred all calls to their lawyer, <PERSON> Seymour </PERSON> <PERSON> Glanzer </PERSON>, who said he had no interest in talking about the Benders. `` The Benders are quite low-key,'' said <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnston </PERSON>, an editor of `` Dossier,'' a magazine that frequently covers social events. <PERSON> Berendzen </PERSON> describes Mrs. <PERSON> Bender </PERSON>, a slender blonde, as a hard-driving, attractive woman. `` Though she is 50, she looks 35, with a broad smile and youthful figure,'' he said. Mrs. <PERSON> Bender </PERSON> is president of the family's tax-exempt philanthropy with assets of about $ 10 million. Tax returns filed in 1987 showed the foundation gave away about $ 1 million the previous year, with the largest chunk _ $ 520,000 _ slated for <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Despite Forecasts, Stock Market Crash Doesn't Usher in Recession</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MARTIN CRUTSINGER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 It was the doomsday that did n't happen. The October stock market collapse, instead of ushering in a recession or worse, has been almost a non-event as far as the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy is concerned. At least that's the opinion of many economists who have been watching with amazement as a string of economic statistics have shown better-than-expected growth this year. Employment gains have pushed the jobless rate down to a nine-year low; consumer spending, especially for autos, has been robust; and American manufacturers are enjoying booming export sales. It was n't supposed to happen this way. Right after Oct. 19, many analysts feared that the record 508-point drop in the stock market would spell 1929 all over again. After a loss of a trillion dollars in wealth, nervous consumers would stop spending. Manufacturers, caught with huge inventories of unsold goods, would cut back production and lay off workers. That would push the unemployment rate up and further erode consumer confidence. The result, according to those post-crash forecasts: a recession starting in the first quarter of 1988, a scenario with ominous implications for Republican hopes of keeping the White House. But many economists believe that instead of declining, the overall economy, as measured by the gross national product, rose at a respectable annual rate of 2 percent or better from January through March. The government will provide the first official look at the GNP on Tuesday. So what went right? In the view of economists, the simple answer is that employers, instead of cutting back on hiring after the stock market crash, actually boosted hiring. In the six months since the market crash, an average of 362,000 new jobs have been added each month, more than twice the size of the average monthly employment gains before the crash. `` The thing that saved the country were those huge gains in employment,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, head of a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> forecasting firm and one of the analysts predicting a recession in the aftermath of the stock crash. `` After the crash, you would have thought that employers would have thrown on the caution light at least for a few months, but instead they stepped up their hiring and that boosted consumer confidence,'' <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> said. Analysts admit they are somewhat puzzled about why employers went on a hiring binge, especially since unsold goods were piling up at an alarming rate in the final three months of the year. One factor that kept <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> hiring strong, they believe, was that much of the rise in inventories represented imported goods. Therefore, cutbacks in new orders hurt foreign producers, not American manufacturers. In addition, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> export sales remained strong, helped out by the weak dollar. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration is counting on a robust export sector to provide almost half of the increased economic growth expected this year and so far that optimism appears warranted. `` The export boom has kept the economy going,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Dederick </PERSON>, chief economist of <ORGANIZATION> Northern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. `` We are beginning to see secondary benefits as businesses, producing at high-capacity rates, boost their investment spending.'' Another factor analysts cite for keeping the economy going was a rebound in car sales in recent months as automakers re-introduced incentive programs to get buyers back into the showrooms. But analysts say none of these things would have helped without the spectacular rise in employment, which pushed the jobless rate down to a nine-year low of 5.6 percent in March. `` The key was employment. It stayed strong and that gave consumers confidence to keep spending, especially for big-ticket items,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, an economist with <ORGANIZATION> Aubrey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> G. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lanston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a government securities dealer. `` Since the consumer is two-thirds of our economy, that made the difference.'' The rebound in consumer spending has brought on a new worry, however _ that demand might be so strong that inflation is reignited. Many economists believe that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> tightened up on credit slightly in March as a way of cooling off demand and keeping the economy from overheating. While interest rates have edged up slightly in recent weeks, economists are not looking for any dramatic move by the <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> to boost rates quickly, especially during an election year. With the strong gains in employment through March, many economists have been revising their growth forecasts for the year. The <ORGANIZATION> Blue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Indicators </ORGANIZATION>, a financial newsletter, said that two-thirds of the 51 top economists it surveys each month had boosted their overall growth forecasts for 1988. The consensus estimate now puts GNP growth for all of 1988 at 2.7 percent, substantially above the 1.9 percent growth being forecast immediately following the market crash. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration is calling for 2.9 percent GNP growth this year.

<HEAD>Nation's Black Leaders Gather for Forum on Urban Problems</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A conference for black public administrators beginning Sunday will address professional concerns and issues like AIDS that span racial lines, as well as minority-oriented topics, organizers said. About 800 people, a record number, were expected to attend the five-day meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administrators </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Melanie </PERSON> <PERSON> Lockwood </PERSON>, program development director in the group's <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, office. The annual conference is an opportunity for black governmental leaders to meet with each other, exchange ideas and recruit, organizers said. One highlight on this year's agenda is Wednesday's panel discussion on the state of inner cities, featuring <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>. But the conference wo n't be devoted to one issue, Ms. <PERSON> Lockwood </PERSON> said. `` It's kind of a dual focus,'' she explained. `` We're looking at a lot of management issues that apply to black and white managers.'' Topics include AIDS, crime and finance management, as well as racism, the problems of the black middle class, crime in the black community, minority hiring and promoting black business ventures. Ms. <PERSON> Lockwood </PERSON> said the number of black city managers has slipped since 1979. Although blacks are continuing to move into city government, they tend to be assistants to executives rather than top managers, she said. `` One of the key goals of the forum is to reverse that decline,'' she said. `` Right now they -LRB- black administrators -RRB- represent less than 1 percent. We're working to empower black administrators.'' About 200 early arrivals got a taste of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> hospitality Saturday with a rodeo organized by city officials and area ranchers. Other speakers scheduled to address the conference include <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> <PERSON> Goode </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> Comptroller <PERSON> Roland </PERSON> <PERSON> Burris </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assemblywoman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maxine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Waters </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>, and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> Supervisor <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>. The 5-year-old forum has about 1,500 members, with more than 20 chapters around the country.

<HEAD>Aviation Safety Proposals: Will They Take?</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A presidential commission has handed the festering ailments of the nation's air travel system back to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, which tried but failed to address the problem last year. With public complaints peaking about safety, chronically delayed and canceled flights, lost baggage and confusing fares, a showpiece bill to protect passengers was pieced together but got bogged down in the 1987 session. Prospects for a new legislative effort are uncertain, even in light of last week's urgent call by the president's <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> for `` decisive'' action. The commission's report urged lawmakers to create a new `` safety czar'' within the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, and to give the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> more clout by removing it from the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION>. The commission also suggested that the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> be freed from cumbersome government rules that hinder its ability to efficiently purchase modern equipment and deploy its air traffic controllers and other employees. In addition, the agency should beef up its 2,000-strong force of inspectors, and become more aggressive in examining the nation's airlines and smaller carriers, the report said. `` Now is the time for decisive action by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the executive branch,'' the commission said, noting that air traffic is expected to continue its rapid growth. A bill introduced last year would make the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> an independent agency and give it more authority to marshall its own forces. That legislation is likely to be modified to accommodate some of the commission's recommendations. Sen. <PERSON> Wendell </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>, D-Ky., one of the bill's chief sponsors and chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> aviation subcommittee, had lined up a total of 50 other co-sponsors by late last week He hopes his panel can write the measure's final version next month. Complaining in a recent interview of `` political regulation'' of the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> by the <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> said `` The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> people need some independence so they can go out and do the things they think should be done.'' But opponents question whether altering the relationship between two federal agencies on a bureaucratic flow chart will have much effect on how safely and quickly airline passengers can get from one city to another. Some say the plan would leave the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> without needed oversight, allowing the agency to develop too cozy a relationship with the industry it is supposed to regulate. `` I think the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> sees the world through aviators' goggles,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>, the agency that investigates transportation accidents. `` I think the effect of this legislation is an industry-relief bill.'' Industry groups support an independent <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION>, but deny that it will be an agency they can easily influence. `` It remains part of the executive branch, it remains part of government,'' said <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Stimpson </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which represents private plane builders. But important members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> involved in aviation matters remain unconvinced. Sen. <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Hollings </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-S.C. </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, which oversees the aviation subcommittee, said that when it comes to an agency's clout, `` It's smarter to have that voice at the cabinet level.'' Added Rep. <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Mineta </PERSON>, D-Calif., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> aviation subcommittee, `` I do n't see the independence of the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> as the solution to their major problems. The commission's suggestion that a powerful `` safety czar'' be established at the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> _ along with a new committee to oversee safety regulations _ was met with raised eyebrows in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and seems unlikely to be approved. `` That's discombobulation, that's not fixing things up,'' said <PERSON> Hollings </PERSON>. In addition to opposition the proposals face, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has a shortened schedule this year, with time off for campaigning. That makes action even less likely. Some of the commission's recommendations can be implemented by the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> without congressional action, such as stepping up inspections of airlines. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> each passed bills last year that would force the airlines to issue detailed monthly reports on late and delayed flights and other problems. The legislation has gone nowhere, however, because negotiators from the two chambers can not agree on whether the bill should also contain new drug-testing requirements. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Albertine </PERSON>, the business executive who headed the safety commission, remains optimistic that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will act this year. `` There is a sense in the public's mind that there are problems in the system that have to be fixed,'' said <PERSON> Albertine </PERSON>, a one-time congressional staff aide. `` When there is that strong a sense in the public's mind, around here people begin to pay attention.''

^Intelligence Report: Gorbachev's Economic Reforms Face Problems</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By TIM AHERN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s economic reform program ran into problems last year and things are n't likely to improve in the near future, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence agencies said in a report released Sunday. Unless <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> can do something to turn the economy around, he may find himself in trouble, said the bleak review which was conducted jointly by the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. `` Tension within society and the leadership will increase,'' it said. `` Bureaucrats will become increasingly frustrated by loss of privileges and status and by demands that they show greater initiative. Military leaders are likely to become more and more uneasy if benefits from the industrial modernization fail to materialize.'' `` Soviet citizens will need to see some improvement in living standards if the regime is to achieve necessary gains in worker productivity and avoid widespread discontent,'' the study said. The report concluded that `` failure to head off these tensions would, at a minimum, make it more difficult to pursue his economic program vigorously and could, ultimately call into question his strong political position at home.'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and supporters of his reforms have acknowledged resistance at the highest levels, and there have been reports in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> of conflict over reform measures between <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and No. 2 <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Yegor </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ligachev </PERSON>. Criticism of the slow pace of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms earlier led to the firing of <PERSON> Boris </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeltsin </PERSON> as <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> Communist Party boss. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence study was presented April 13 to the congressional <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, and a declassified version was released by the panel. The study is the annual review of the Soviet economy, three years after <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> came to power. He inherited an aging, extremely inefficient economy and made its modernization one of his top priorities, the study noted. After some early success, `` <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s ambitious program to create a modern, more dynamic Soviet economy ran into trouble in 1987,'' the study said. `` Familiar problems with poor weather and transportation bottlenecks were compounded by the disruptions caused by the introduction of economic reforms,'' it said. The Soviet gross national product, the total value of all goods and services produced, grew only .5 percent last year, the study noted. That rate was `` reminiscent of the late <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> period,'' it said, referring to <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> predecessor who prevailed over a largely stagnant economy in the late 1970s and early 1980s. The study noted that the Soviet GNP grew by 3.9 percent in 1986, the first full year of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s term, compared with .6 percent in 1985. By contrast, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> gross national product grew 2.9 percent, both in 1986 and 1987. However, the American economy measures a much larger base and comparisons are difficult. The Soviet economy was hampered by bad weather last year, particularly in agriculture, where output fell three percent, the study said. But industrial quality control measures also `` proved to be particularly disruptive, especially early in the year.'' Thus, industry only grew 1.5 percent and the civilian machine-building sector did n't grow at all. `` The real loser in 1987 appeared to be the consumer, who _ now three years into <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s economic program _ has seen almost no increase in his standard of living,'' the study said. It also said that for a variety of reasons, `` the short-term outlook for <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s economic program is not good.'' Among those reasons are confusion about guidelines for self-financing reforms, deficiencies in 1987 machine-building that will slow the speed of modernization, transportation problems, and poor prospects for improved worker productivity. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> also needs to be better organized, the study concluded. `` Although <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s program is comprehensive, it is in some respects inconsistent, particularly with regard to timing. For example, his goals for an immediate acceleration in the growth of national income and a pronounced improvement in the quality of output are, in our view, fundamentally incompatible.'' In addition, `` his plan to change traditional economic planning and administrative procedures dramatically has been thrust upon a largely unprepared bureaucracy,'' the study said.

 Demonstrators threw a firebomb at a governing party candidate and two dozen people were arrested Sunday. Politicians made last-minute appeals for support in Tuesday's legislative elections. The nation's 130,000-member <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> force went on full alert in a routine move to provide security Sunday, the 18th and final day of official campaigning for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> elections. The balloting is the first test of public confidence in the government of President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> Tae-woo since he was inaugurated on Feb. 25, after his win in December's presidential vote. About 200 people who left an opposition rally held a sit-in at <LOCATION> Myungdong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cathedral </LOCATION> in downtown <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> where they shouted, `` Down with <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> Tae-woo.'' The protesters marched in the streets after dark, prompting police to use tear gas. About 20 people were taken away by police. In the southeastern city of <LOCATION> Taegu </LOCATION>, police arrested four students for hurling a firebomb at a government party candidate who was making a speech during a joint rally. Even before the police alert went into effect, officers were deployed in force throughout the country to minimize violence at campaign rallies. Scattered incidents marred some rallies in recent days. Police said 147 people had been booked so far for violating election laws. Of those detained, only 12 were put under formal arrest, and the rest were set free, they said. At stake in Tuesday's elections are 299 seats, 244 of which are decided by popular vote, with the remaining 75 seats allocated to parties in proportion to the total popular vote they receive. After the opposition split and lost the presidential vote, opposition parties are struggling to make a strong comeback in the legislative elections. Their efforts are hampered by internal divisions. All election surveys by local newspapers indicated President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> would easily win a majority in the assembly. `` We aim only for 55 percent of the seats,'' party chairman <PERSON> Chae </PERSON> <PERSON> Moon-shik </PERSON> told reporters, denying predictions the governing party would sweep the elections.

 <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technologies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and the government of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> are quietly lobbying the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> for an export permit that would allow the defense contractor to help <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> design an air-launched, armor-seeking weapon system. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials so far have refused to issue the company the necessary license, saying that the system would violate a six-year ban on the sale of `` cluster bomb'' technology to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The company's lobbying effort is outlined in a Feb. 4 memo from <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technologies </ORGANIZATION> to <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Derwinski </PERSON>, under secretary of state for security assistance, science and technology. Defense Week, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> publication, reports in its issue dated Monday that top <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> officials also have been lobbying for the <ORGANIZATION> UTC </ORGANIZATION> license. In the memo from C.R. <PERSON> Bergwin </PERSON>, director of export license administration for <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION>, Conn.-based <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technologies </ORGANIZATION>, the company argues that the ban should not apply to the $ 50 million contract. `` In order that we may proceed with the program, we urgently require an interpretation that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government's cluster munition policy does not apply to our contract,'' <PERSON> Bergwin </PERSON> wrote. He said the company believes that the 1982 ban was aimed at cluster bombs designed to be used against people, not against tanks and armored vehicles. <PERSON> Bergwin </PERSON> also argued that the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technologies </ORGANIZATION> contract should not be subject to the ban because `` our limited engineering participation in this program'' has nothing to do with the warhead portion of the system. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> hired the company to design the nose, wing and control modules of the weapon system. The contract was under <ORGANIZATION> UTC </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Norden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Norwalk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, but has been transferred to the corporation's Advanced Systems Division in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>, a source told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. The White House imposed the cluster bomb ban on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in 1982 after evidence surfaced that the devices were used by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> against civilians during its invasion of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, an apparent violation of assurances <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> had previously given <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials. But Israeli officials, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, told Defense Week that the proposed weapon was much different from a traditional cluster bomb. Conventional cluster bombs spread scores of `` bomblets'' indiscriminately, while the weapon under development would dispense no more than 10 submunitions that would seek out individual armor targets such as tanks, they said. But tank-seeking weapons that miss their primary target `` do n't turn into potted plants,'' one Pentagon official told <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Week </ORGANIZATION> `` They sense large metal objects like school buses and can cause civilian casualties.'' The newsletter said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials likely would approve the export permit if <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> signs a proposal submitted two years ago by the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> that would detail how <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> could use such weapons. But <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> does not want to sign the agreement. A <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman reached over the weekend declined comment. <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technologies </ORGANIZATION> said in a prepared statement: `` It's a classified Israeli program, and therefore we can not comment.''

<HEAD>Sloppy Repairs, Drunkenness, Nepotism Plague Chernobyl Plant on
Anniversary</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>

 Sloppy repairs, drunkenness and nepotism are rampant at the <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION> nuclear plant two years after the world's worst nuclear disaster, Pravda said Sunday The Communist Party daily said engineering jobs at the plant were handed out to medics, teachers, veterinarians and people without any higher education. It also accused Chernobyl's managers of trying to `` resolve at any cost'' obstacles to full electricity production at the plant `` to the detriment of the quality of repair and maintenance of extremely intricate equipment.'' The scathing attack was a departure from the numerous articles appearing in the Soviet press before Tuesday's anniversary of the April 26, 1986, explosion and fire at the power plant 80 miles north of the Ukrainian capital of <LOCATION> Kiev </LOCATION>. The explosion killed 31 people, spewed radiation around the world and forced the evacuation of 135,000 Soviets living near the plant. The previous stories have stressed the extensive safety equipment installed at the plant, improved worker training, the decrease to safe levels of radiation and the return of people to surrounding areas. Pravda began by reporting safe radiation levels at the plant and the production of 21 billion kilowatt-hours of electricity there since the accident. But then the focus turned to criticism by the <LOCATION> Kiev </LOCATION> region's <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> committee of `` Kombinat,'' the organization supervising the plant and cleanup around it Plant equipment was repaired without technical supervisors and was not tested before being put into service despite serious defects, the newspaper said. It said other problems caused `` the grossest violations of sanitary standards.'' Some safety measures planned on the reactor No. 4 at the plant were not carried out because of <ORGANIZATION> Kombinat </ORGANIZATION>'s negligence, Pravda said. That reactor, in which the explosion occurred, has been sealed in concrete laden with radiation sensors. Other official reports have stressed the danger from the No. 4 reactor has been neutralized. `` Leadership posts were given to people who had criminal records, who had been excluded from the party or had received strict party penalties,'' Pravda said. `` Units were headed by people not able to cope with the business they were entrusted with: medics, teachers, veterinarians and people not having any higher education were working in engineering posts,'' Pravda said. Discipline was slack, the newspaper said. `` In the ` Kombinat' amalgamation, drunkenness, thievery and violations of labor discipline have not been reduced,'' it said. Pravda did not say whether any corrective action had been taken, other than to report that <LOCATION> Kiev </LOCATION> party leaders reprimanded <PERSON> Kombinat </PERSON>'s head, and indicated he had been fired `` <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ignatenko </PERSON> displayed liberalism and political immaturity in the evaluation of the lack of discipline: multiple violations of organizational and financial discipline, protectionism, nepotism, moral breakdown of leaders,'' the paper said. The party leaders also reprimanded the Chernobyl plant's director `` Judging from all this, the leadership of Kombinat has not learned a lesson from the past,'' Pravda said. `` It's as though there has n't been an accident.'' The article indicated that managers tolerated the shortcomings because of a widespread problem in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> industry: pressure to fulfill a production plan. The government has said it must increase the production of nuclear power plants to meet the country's electricity needs. The Chernobyl plant, with two of its four reactors now operating, has been ordered to generate 19.9 billion kilowatt-hours this year. Hints of problems at the plant first came in December. <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lukyanenko </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> head in <LOCATION> Slavutich </LOCATION>, a new town for plant workers near <LOCATION> Chernobyl </LOCATION>, told a newspaper that sloppy work, poor discipline and safety violations at the plant contributed to 36 accidents over a 10-month period, three of them fatal. <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Semyonov </PERSON>, deputy head of the Chernobyl cleanup commission, denied at a <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> news conference Wednesday that any major accident or deaths occurred at the plant since the 1986 explosion.

 Evangelist <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> preached to nearly 5,000 Christians who packed three churches in this sprawling port city Sunday and said religion can help the communist government's modernization policy. `` It seems that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s leaders are talking about moral and spiritual renewal,'' <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> told about 100 <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> pastors and church leaders, speaking through a translator at All Saint's Church. `` Even secular leaders are asking the question, ` Where are we to find the moral renewal we need to be successful in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s modernization program?'' said the Southern Baptist minister. `` Could they turn to us?'' The 69-year-old Southern Baptist minister, who seemed somewhat guarded when he preached in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> last week for the first time in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, held nothing back in his sermon to the pastors of all 23 <ORGANIZATION> Shanghai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> churches. Several Catholic priests and nuns also attended. `` Be a spirit-filled minister,'' he thundered. `` Know something about the -LRB- Holy -RRB- Spirit in your life.'' Speaking of a spiritual renewal in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, he told them: `` God may be doing things in your country you're not even aware of. I see evidence of it everywhere, and it gladdens my heart.'' <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s biggest city with more than 6.3 million people, has about 60,000 Protestants. About 4 million people nationwide belong to the non-denominational Protestant church sanctioned by the government. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has about 3 million Catholics who belong to the official <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Patriotic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which does not recognize the authority of the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>. Millions more Protestants and Catholics are believed to pray privately in their homes. Earlier Sunday, <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> urged more than 3,000 Christians at the city's largest Protestant church to let their faith show in their daily lives. `` Let people see that you're different,'' said <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>, speaking through a translator at <ORGANIZATION> Mu-en </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, more than 100 years old. The mostly elderly congregation listened attentively, some nodding at times in agreement. One elderly man sitting in the balcony held up a sign with a bright red cross and `` God loves the world'' written in Chinese. `` You are known and prayed for throughout the world,'' said <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>, who has preached in nearly 70 countries. He arrived in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> on April 12 for a 16-day tour. The Pure Heart Church also was filled to overflowing with about 1,500 people when <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> spoke there Sunday evening. About 50 people sat on stone benches in the church courtyard and listened to loudspeakers that broadcast <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>'s sermon, which discussed the ways <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Christ </PERSON> described himself to his followers. The Mu-en Church was built by Methodists in 1887. However, <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> denominations no longer exist in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, all having been united under the official <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>. Like all other churches and religious institutions in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, it was closed during the radical leftist 1966-76 Cultural Revolution, when all religious activity was banned. The Mu-en Church was reopened in 1979, and its two Sunday morning services regularly attract a total of about 3,000 worshipers.

 An unauthorized <PERSON> Jeane </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirkpatrick </PERSON> for Vice President campaign has garnered $ 100,000 and 1,400 volunteers in less than four months, but is unlikely to win a blessing from the former <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> ambassador herself. The independent draft movement was the brainchild of <PERSON> Curt </PERSON> <PERSON> Clinkscales </PERSON>, founder of a controversial senior citizens lobbying group, owner of a direct mail firm and director of the <PERSON> Kirkpatrick </PERSON> effort. Since January he and other <PERSON> Kirkpatrick </PERSON> aficionados have been testing the grass roots through direct mailings and petitions circulated at state Republican conventions. `` We have found that she is enormously popular. It's just been incredible,'' <PERSON> Clinkscales </PERSON> said. `` This will show the vice president -LRB- <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> -RRB- that the ideal selection is <PERSON> Jeane </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirkpatrick </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Kirkpatrick </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Georgetown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> professor and a fellow at the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, declined to be interviewed on the subject. But she said through a spokesman that she has no connection with the <PERSON> Clinkscales </PERSON> effort and does not want one. `` She believes the decision on the vice president should be solely that of Vice President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>,'' the expected <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nominee, said <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Salter </PERSON>, the spokesman. <PERSON> Clinkscales </PERSON>, a direct mail expert and former member of the executive committee of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Political </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, does n't disagree with that. But he says he's hoping to create such a groundswell for <PERSON> Kirkpatrick </PERSON> that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> wo n't dare choose anyone else. `` Frankly, without this effort, I do n't think Dr. <PERSON> Kirkpatrick </PERSON> would be given serious consideration for the nomination,'' he said. `` With it, I think she will get it.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spokesman <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Teeley </PERSON> predicted that the <PERSON> Clinkscales </PERSON> initiative would not be the first lobbying effort on behalf of one vice presidential possibility or another. `` Mrs. <PERSON> Kirkpatrick </PERSON> is wise in not becoming involved in this operation and she is correct in her statement that it is the vice president's choice. He will make that after a lot of consideration,'' <PERSON> Teeley </PERSON> said. `` These efforts are sometimes embarrassing to the people that they're allegedly designed to help,'' he added. `` There's just something really unseemly about trying to force somebody onto a ticket ... to throw them forward in an effort they have n't sanctioned themselves. In his letter to potential contributors, <PERSON> Clinkscales </PERSON> wrote that <PERSON> Kirkpatrick </PERSON>'s `` widespread popular support convinced many party officials to begin this independent draft effort. I agreed to serve as campaign director to help make 1988 a milestone year for freedom everywhere.'' However, asked in an interview whose idea it was to start a draft-Kirkpatrick campaign, <PERSON> Clinkscales </PERSON> replied, `` It was mine.'' He said his company, <ORGANIZATION> CLCO </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, has sent out 400,000 letters in weekly waves that started last Jan. 28. <PERSON> Clinkscales </PERSON> said his suppliers are making money from the campaign but he and his company are not. He said the effort is self-sustaining, supported by donations from the people who get the letters. In addition to running <ORGANIZATION> CLCO </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Clinkscales </PERSON> is national director of the arch-conservative <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION>, which he founded in 1974.

<HEAD>Dukakis and Jackson: Rivals and Friends</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 They are an odd couple _ the cool technocrat from <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> and the fiery preacher from the civil rights movement. Rivals they still are, but <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> have become friends as they have survived to the endgame of the Democratic nomination wars of 1988. `` We like each other and we respect each other,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> tells crowds. `` We may differ on some issues, but if we do, it is in the spirit of friendship.'' Politicians often say they like each other or are friends when there is little there but political necessity and practical relationships. But aides to both candidates say the Dukakis-Jackson relationship is getting stronger and more personal day by day. It is a relationship nutured in private talks and public positions. The two meet on the campaign trail, most often at debates. This weekend, in debates in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>, there was much laughter and smiling and banter as they talked of their agreement on the issues and little about their disagreements. `` It's been growing and it is very positive,'' said <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> adviser, of the developing relationship between the two candidates. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> said the two-week <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> battle was a key to the friendship, as both men avoided negative campaigning. The two also talk by phone at least once a week _ the loser calling to congratulate the winner Wednesday morning after each primary. `` They've been through the same grueling experience together _ this campaign,'' added <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> aide <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Dach </PERSON>. `` That's gives them a lot in common.'' In the next few weeks and months, their relationship may be the single most important one for the party and its hopes for winning back the White House in November. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is the front-runner with a growing lead: <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, the black leader who excites crowds like no other politician today. How <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> deals with <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and his supporters will determine in large part their commitment to the Democratic ticket in the fall. `` How do we channel the enthusiasm in that community?'' Rep. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Florio </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.J. </LOCATION>, asked <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> at one <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> campaign stop as they talked of the fall campaign. Thus, the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> aversion to negative campaigns and his need for <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s help dovetail nicely. `` Yes, I want to win, but this is going to be a positive campaign,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Aliquippa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION> `` We both happen to be very positive people,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> told a labor rally Saturday morning in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. `` We both understand that there is one overriding goal in this campaign and that is to win in November.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' dealings with <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> will shape many voters' perception of what kind of a leader this <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor really is In 1984, Democratic nominee <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON>'s failure to deal effectively with <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> in his first bid for the nomination helped create the perception that <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON> was a weak leader who pandered ineffectively to the key black voting bloc in the party. This year, there were reports that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> did not get along particularly well, reports that both camps say were exaggerated or wrong. The relationship improved after Super Tuesday, as <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was gracious in his victory in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> and finishing ahead of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, in turn, was gracious in accepting defeat and pushing on to the next state. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> resisted all pressure to be sharply critical of <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, even after Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> went dramatically negative against <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> in a desparate effort to revive his candidacy in the two weeks before the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> primary. And <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> joined in, adding a racial and religious overtone to the debate that brought <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> strong rebukes from some. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> both refused to trade charges on that level, tactics that they repeatedly praised each other for. Now the relationship will be truly tested, as the two go head-to-head for the rest of the primary season and perhaps into the convention. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is treading very, very carefully in his theme of government experience as the reason to win voters' support. While at times his stance of `` I'm a doer, not a talker'' seemed aimed directly at <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, he is careful now to praise <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> even as he draws the distinctions. `` <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> has his own strengths and his own message and it's an important one,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` What I offer is a record of helping to create jobs, to save jobs ... of building housing, and providing health care.'' Asked if that meant <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> does n't have a record, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> insisted he did n't mean that. `` He does n't have a record in government. I do. He has his other strengths. I respect them and I admire them,'' he said.

 Pro-Iranian extremists said Sunday they will kill two American hostages and may attack inside the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> if <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warships in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> launch new attacks on <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. The statement came hours after an Iranian gunboat attacked a Saudi Arabian tanker in the gulf, despite a warning by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> faced `` very costly'' consequences if it continued hitting neutral ships and other targets. The extremists made their latest threat in a handwritten statement signed by the <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, a Shiite Moslem group, and delivered to The Associated Press and the French news agency Agence France-Presse. The group holds <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Cicippio </PERSON>, 57, of <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Forge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Tracy </PERSON>, 57, of <LOCATION> Burlington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vt. </LOCATION> `` Any new -LRB- <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> -RRB- aggression under any pretext or excuse will lead to the execution of spy <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Tracy </PERSON> first and <PERSON> Cicippio </PERSON> secondly,'' the statement announced. <PERSON> Tracy </PERSON>, a writer of children's books, was kidnapped Oct. 21, 1986. <PERSON> Cicippio </PERSON>, acting comptroller at the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beirut </ORGANIZATION>, was kidnapped from campus earlier that year on Sept. 12. <PERSON> Cicippio </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tracy </PERSON> are among nine Americans and 13 other foreigners held hostage by various groups in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The longest held is 40-year-old <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Lorain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, the chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent for the <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> who was kidnapped March 16, 1985. Both copies of Sunday's statement were accompanied by photocopies of a Lebanese group's membership card bearing <PERSON> Tracy </PERSON>'s photograph However, the organization is not named on the card, and it was not clear if it was authentic. Last Monday, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warships disabled two Iranian frigates and sank or disabled four other armed Iranian vessels in the gulf. <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> said 44 Iranians were killed. `` The attacks occurring in the gulf will not go unpunished and will not be as easy as <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> assumes,'' the statement said. `` Our logical answer to the invasion of the region ... brings us to the option of moving the battle arena to inside <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, after which things will get out of control.'' In another development, <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s conservative Ad-Diyar daily newspaper reported Sunday that a deal to free three French hostages held by another <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> faction fell apart because of developments in the hijacking of a Kuwaiti airliner. The report said the captors reneged on pledges to release the French hostages because the hijackers were still in <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>. Arab officials said that when the Algerians negotiated an end to the 16-day hijacking Wednesday, the Shiite sky pirates abandoned the plane for guaranteed safe conduct to another country. But Ad-Diyar, without citing sources, challenged earlier reports that the hijackers had left <LOCATION> Algiers </LOCATION> and gone to either <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Sunday's threat was the second issued by <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> in less than a week. The group said in a similar handwritten Arabic-language statement Tuesday that there would be `` retaliations and retaliations'' for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military action in the gulf. The earlier statement was accompanied by a Polaroid photograph of <PERSON> Cicippio </PERSON>. In Sunday's statement, the extremists described <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> naval presence in the gulf as a `` mean challenge to the free nations of the world.'' The fighting in the gulf last Monday flared after <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warships blasted two offshore Iranian oil platforms in what <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> termed a `` measured response'' to the mining of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> frigate April 14.

 A man who set his gasoline-soaked clothes on fire and walked down the aisle of a church during a prayer service died Sunday from his burns, though worshippers tried to save him by dousing the flames.

<HEAD>Pennsylvania's Confused Delegate Selection Process Is Under Fire</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JEFF BARKER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>PHILADELPHIA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 As <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> voters prepare to cast ballots in Tuesday's primary, there is growing criticism of the state's unusual delegate-selection system. Voters must choose from 300 largely obscure delegate candidates _ without knowing the contenders' presidential preferences. Sen. <PERSON> Arlen </PERSON> <PERSON> Specter </PERSON>, R-Pa., has called for changing the system And <PERSON> Elsie </PERSON> <PERSON> Hillman </PERSON>, who heads <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> operation, said not listing prospective delegates' loyalties is `` absolutely silly, ridiculous.'' With so many unknown delegate contenders running for a spot at the national convention, the Republican system places a premium on ballot position _ so much so that at least one congressman running for delegate believes he may lose because voters wo n't see his name. `` I'm running for delegate, but I'm like 17th out of 18 people -LRB- on the ballot -RRB-,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Ritter </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Lehigh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. `` I suspect that most people wo n't get to my name, so it would not be at all surprising to finish very poorly.'' Another delegate candidate, <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Falcone </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, called the list of names `` a spaghetti pile'' and said there are so many names in his 11th Congressional District that `` voters actually have to get down on their knees in the balloting box to get to where the delegates are, and I'm last.'' <PERSON> Said </PERSON> <PERSON> Hillman </PERSON>: `` It's going to be a screwy ballot.'' <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> will send 96 delegates to the GOP convention in August. Eighteen of those, including <PERSON> Specter </PERSON>, have already been picked by the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. The rest will be elected Tuesday. The ballot includes a handful of congressmen, a former congressman, and dozens of local elected officials. It also includes many candidates making their first run at any office above the city level. `` I just wanted to get more involved in the political process,'' said contender <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Romeo </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, vice president of a family-owned food distribution firm in <LOCATION> Uniontown </LOCATION>. `` I'm a committeemen, but I've never tried to run for anything else. <PERSON> Romeo </PERSON> drew poor ballot position _ seventh among seven candidates vying for three spots in the 22nd Congressional District. Each of the state's 23 districts automatically get three delegates, and some get more based on a complicated formula that considers their support for <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in 1984, among other factors. <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>'s system evolved out of a desire to give the state more clout at the convention by holding back committing delegates to particular candidates. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said in an interview that the method encourages grassroots involvement. If delegates' preferences appeared on the ballot, then `` you would take out the local aspect and have a fight between tickets,'' he said. <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>'s GOP delegate rules are set by the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said he saw no reason to change. But <PERSON> Specter </PERSON> said voters `` are entitled to have commitments. Otherwise, you do n't have the will of the people expressed.'' `` It's anti-democratic, with a small ` D' and a big ` D,' `` said <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> Delano </PERSON>, press secretary to Rep. <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Walgren </PERSON>, D-Pa. He said he preferred the <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> Democrats' system of listing delegates on the ballot according to presidential preference or as `` uncommitted.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is expected to win the lion's share of <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> delegates, mostly because his workers aggressively recruited well-known local figures to run. Also, the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> camp recently mailed 300,000 slate cards to Republican voters listing which delegates back the vice president. But supporters of <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON> drew the top ballot position in 12 districts. Of course, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> Republicans will also cast their ballots for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> or <PERSON> Robertson </PERSON>. But that `` beauty contest'' portion of the election has no bearing on delegates.

<TEXT>
 Bishop <PERSON> Cyril </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wismar </PERSON> had prayed much of his life for a united <ORGANIZATION> Lutheran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, and when his prayers were answered, he was left unemployed. <LOCATION> Wismar </LOCATION>, 69, is one of several hundred bishops, clergy members and lay church employees who lost their jobs when three Lutheran branches merged Jan. 1 into the 5.3 million-member <ORGANIZATION> Evangelical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lutheran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Wismar </LOCATION> had served for nearly 12 years as the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> bishop of the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Evangelical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lutheran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Churches </ORGANIZATION>, the smallest of the denominations. His main goal now is to develop a ministry for other members of the clergy who are retired or alone. `` I do n't feel sorry for myself. I feel sorry for many, many people. You have to realize that out there there are, I guess, literally thousands of people who are no longer serving in the roles in which they served in their former church affiliation,'' <PERSON> Wismar </PERSON> said in a recent interview at his home here. `` For a while your telephone rings a lot, and people call you a lot, and you're running around a lot to parishes and assisting pastors and people and then suddenly you're not,'' <PERSON> Wismar </PERSON> said. `` For almost 12 years I've been doing that and so very suddenly you come to a screeching halt, and you want to do something,'' he said. It's hard to think of the retired bishop doing nothing. Besides helping out at a local church, he regularly visits patients in hospitals and convalescent homes, administers communion to shut-ins, hosts a half-hour local radio program every Sunday and does a daily religious news update. He also serves on the <ORGANIZATION> Falls </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Village </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Housatonic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Valley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Regional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> board, and the town and regional housing commissions. But for those with less to do, <LOCATION> Wismar </LOCATION> is petitioning the new church to endorse his visitation program for retired clergy members. He is asking parishes and private foundations to donate the $ 12,000 to $ 13,000 a year to pay him a stipend, transportation and communication costs. The new denomination was created by the merger of the <ORGANIZATION> Lutheran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lutheran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, and the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Evangelical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lutheran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Churches </ORGANIZATION>. Bishop <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Chilstrom </PERSON>, head of the new church, said church planners decided all applicants for positions in the new church would be treated equally, regardless of whether they held offices in the past. In the Lutheran church, people are chosen for posts by secret ballots of congregations. `` Everyone lost their position, because in the Lutheran church, you are not a bishop for life,'' <PERSON> Chilstrom </PERSON> said in a telephone interview from the church's <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> headquarters. `` No one who was a bishop had any guarantee he would continue in the church.'' Of those like <LOCATION> Wismar </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Chilstrom </PERSON> said: `` It's a very tricky thing to say that these people in all cases were simply turned out. What I can say in general is because of the merger on a churchwide level, we were reduced by several hundred people.'' <LOCATION> Wismar </LOCATION> is pushing his plan because, `` as bishop, I noted that the people who are the most forgotten and neglected people in the church are the retired clergy and widows of retired clergy. So I have devised a scheme for visitation of these people to find out what their needs are.''

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON>'s defense team has mounted a desperate effort to block a death sentence for the retired <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> autoworker convicted of being a brutal <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> death camp guard. But the death penalty is expected Monday from the three <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> judges who pronounced <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> guilty last week in a sweeping verdict that rejected all defense arguments. Only one man has ever been executed in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s 40-year history. <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Eichmann </PERSON>, the architect of the <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s `` Final Solution'' against Jews, was convicted and hanged in 1962 <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON>'s attorneys say their only goal at Monday's hearing will be to save their client's life. Attorney <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Gill </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> said the defense and <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON>'s family are convinced evidence will eventually emerge clearing his client. `` But if the judges impose the ` final solution' on <PERSON> John </PERSON>, they wo n't be able to bring him back when it becomes clear it was all a mistake,'' the defense attorney said. In their 450-page judgment, the tribunal convicted <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> `` without hesitation or doubt'' of being the guard `` Ivan the Terrible'' and said he killed `` masses of human beings with his own hands'' at the <LOCATION> Treblinka </LOCATION> death camp in Nazi-occupied <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Yossi </PERSON> <PERSON> Hassin </PERSON>, a government-appointed trial spokesman, said <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> most likely will face execution. `` This verdict paved the way for a death sentence. I would be very surprised if the judges gave <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> anything less than death,'' he told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON>'s son said no matter what the defense argues, he and other family members know what the sentence will be. `` After the ludicrously sweeping judgment, we do n't expect anything less than a death penalty,'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said in an interview. `` These are old-fashioned hanging judges.'' Nazi war crimes and terrorism are the only offenses punishable by death in the Jewish state, and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has never executed a convicted terrorist. Justice Minister <PERSON> Avraham </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharir </PERSON> urged the death penalty for <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON>. `` A man convicted of such terrible crimes deserves no other sentence,'' he said. <PERSON> Sharir </PERSON> has no authority over the state prosecutor who argues the sentence Monday, but his statement reflects the sentiments of many Israelis, including the nation's 80,000 Holocaust survivors. `` The death penalty is what this man deserves,'' said French-born <PERSON> Dina </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosenbaum </PERSON>, 58, who lost most of her family in <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> death camps. `` I'm only sorry he lived so many years before being brought to justice.'' Throughout the 14-month trial, <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> maintained his innocence and insisted he was a victim of mistaken identity. After the verdict, a somber-looking <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> shouted to reporters as he was led away: `` I am an innocent man! This is ridiculous what happened today!'' Emerging from a visit with his father in prison, <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON>'s son <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said: `` My father says the only judge that counts is God. God knows he's innocent.'' Five death camp survivors identified <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> as <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON>, including one who said he recognized the defendant's walk and another who said he remembered <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON>'s `` murderous eyes.'' At Monday's hearing, <PERSON> Gill </PERSON> said he would emphasize the fallability of human memory and introduce 350 cases from as early as 1963 in which people later found to be innocent were convicted and sentenced to death. In 62 percent of the cases, the wrongful conviction was due to mistaken identity, <PERSON> Gill </PERSON> said. But that argument has already been rejected by the judges, who in their verdict gave great weight to the survivors' testimony and praised their `` reliability ... and excellent memories.'' Although a guilty verdict was expected, most longtime observers were surprised by the judges' systematic rejection of all defense evidence, including documents that contradicted the survivors' testimony The judges dismissed discrepancies between survivors who contended <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> was at <LOCATION> Treblinka </LOCATION> in 1942 and 1943, and a former <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> guard who said <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON> was at the nearby <LOCATION> Sobibor </LOCATION> death camp at the same time. Some Israelis believe the death penalty will be imposed but not executed. `` People expect this court to hand down the death penalty and the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to reduce it to life imprisonment,'' said <PERSON> Gabriel </PERSON> <PERSON> Bron </PERSON> of the Israeli daily <ORGANIZATION> Yediot </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ahronot </ORGANIZATION>. `` The feeling is the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> will give greater weight to the doubts.'' Trial spokesman <PERSON> Hassin </PERSON> agreed, saying the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> `` could make a political decision to spare <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON>. Here in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> we do n't like to impose death, not even for terrorists.'' But <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON>'s son-in-law <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Nishnic </PERSON>, who raised $ 650,000 for <PERSON> Demjanjuk </PERSON>'s defense, said he does n't expect clemency. `` The Israelis are killing Palestinians like they were open game,'' <PERSON> Nishnic </PERSON> said, referring to Arabs killed during a five-month uprising in the Israeli-occupied territories. `` <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> is going to do with <PERSON> John </PERSON> whatever suits its purpose,'' he said. `` It does n't care what the rest of the world thinks of its judicial system.''

 A laboratory spill that led investigators on a trail of radioactive trash and contaminated several workers before the danger was apparent is under investigation for possible charges against the lab's owner, it was reported Sunday. The <ORGANIZATION> Marshall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diagnostics </ORGANIZATION> lab where the chemical spill occurred has been closed since shortly after the February accident, and state officials said they will seal the lab until September, when the radioactive residues will be harmless. State health officials have tested the homes of lab workers and found low levels of radioactivity on pant legs, shoes and other clothing of six workers. The <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sunday </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION> reported that the spill happened Feb. 4 when <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mead </PERSON>, a co-owner of the lab and a chemical engineer for 42 years, was working with tungsten 178 _ a radioactive material that could help detect heart and other medical problems. When he realized the following day that about two ounces of the solution had spilled, he tried to scrub it clean with bleach and water, then tossed the wet towels into the trash. A janitor, not realizing the spill was radioactive, volunteered to finish cleaning the lab over the weekend. The following Monday, <PERSON> Mead </PERSON>'s son did some carpentry work at the lab. He threw his trash _ and the contaminated rags _ into his truck and took it to his parents' home in <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION>, where the debris was put out the next Wednesday with the family's garbage. Garbagemen took the two contaminated bags, along with the rest of their load, to the Resco incinerator in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Andover </LOCATION>. When they tried to unload, an alarm went off and caused Resco to refuse the garbage. The radioactive wastes were taken to an old sanitary landfill in <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION>. The next day, <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION> police, who had found an old bill linking the trash to <PERSON> Mead </PERSON>, visited him at the lab, and he accompanied them to the landfill. <PERSON> Mead </PERSON> collected the contaminated materials, which had leaked from his garbage bags and now filled 10 plastic bags, and took them to his lab. Two wheelbarrows of contaminated material were removed five days later from the landfill after a snowstorm. <PERSON> Mead </PERSON> has given a detailed chronology of the spill and its spread to state officials, who have supplemented the report with their own investigation, the <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION> said. `` We are going out of business,'' <PERSON> Mead </PERSON> told the newspaper. `` My partner and I are going into retirement.'' While officials expect any radioactive material in the lab to decay, the remaining wastes have been shipped to a licensed storage facility in <LOCATION> Tinley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hallisey </PERSON>, chief of radiation safety at the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>, said he is considering whether to impose penalties or recommend prosecution against <PERSON> Mead </PERSON> and his partner, <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> <PERSON> Deutsch </PERSON> <PERSON> Hallisey </PERSON> said he was pleased by <PERSON> Mead </PERSON>'s cooperation, but still could recommend penalties of up to $ 6,000. `` We need a strong state posture on handling radioactive materials,'' <PERSON> Hallisey </PERSON> said. `` We intend to do that.''

 The nation's county governments spend just over $ 426 per resident to provide services, led by the largest counties, the <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> reports. A survey of county governments released Sunday found spending by counties averaged $ 426.22 per resident nationwide in the 1985-86 fiscal year. But counties with populations of 500,000 or more spent an average of $ 503.99 per resident, the report found. By comparison, counties of fewer than 100,000 spent $ 383.12 per resident. Seven counties spent more than $ 1,000 per resident providing services, the <ORGANIZATION> Census </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> noted. They are: _ <LOCATION> Montgomery </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, $ 1,684 _ <LOCATION> Fairfax </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, $ 1,648 _ <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, $ 1,298 _ Prince <LOCATION> Georges </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, $ 1,210 _ <LOCATION> Clark </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nev. </LOCATION>, $ 1,041 _ <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, $ 1,026 _ <LOCATION> Nassau </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, $ 1,020 Types of spending vary greatly from county to county. Education is a small share of many county governments, yet provides as much as half of the spending for the four with the largest per capita expenditures, the study found.

 A cadre of officers has kept the peace during this year's Chippewa Indian spearfishing season, the fourth since federal courts upheld the <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION>' right to harvest resources on lands the tribes ceded to the government. Protests against the Indian fishing rights and their method of taking large numbers of sport fish have been noisy and violent in previous years, including shots fired at some lakes in 1986. No serious injuries have been reported. An argument between an Indian and an non-Indian over a traffic incident last week looked like it might turn into a scuffle, but Iron County Sheriff <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Bungi </PERSON> quickly separated the two. When more spectators arrived, he called for backup officers, bringing in more than a dozen squad cars. The six-year veteran, who oversees a four-man department, has become experienced in handling crowds during the controversial off-reservation spearfishing season on lakes in northern <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>. Protesters consider spearing an unfair way of bagging the walleyed pike and muskies that are a prime tourism attraction for sportsfishers. An early show of force by police marked this spearfishing season, and protests seem to have moved off the boat landings and onto the lakes. Each night before sunset, a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> helicopter passes over the lakes. Police sometimes outnumber spectators. And new signs announce that alcoholic beverages are prohibited on the landings at night. Federal court rulings have upheld <LOCATION> Chippewa </LOCATION> rights, retained in 19th century treaties, to harvest resources _ including fishing, hunting, trapping and harvesting wild rice _ off the reservations on land the tribes ceded to the federal government. Each band is allowed 15 days of spearing. Spearers may take no more than 20 percent of what biologists figure a lake's fish population can tolerate. The season ends by May 6. The Indians fish at night, using lanterns to help them find the fish, which they catch with spears up to eight feet in length. On Saturday night, 11th night of the season, 123 <LOCATION> Chippewa </LOCATION> spearers took 3,088 fish despite cold weather and snow in some places. <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON>, a state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> spokesman at <LOCATION> Woodruff </LOCATION>, said there was no trouble at any site, although a group of protesters did watch the <LOCATION> Lac </LOCATION> <LOCATION> du </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Flambeau </LOCATION> tribe spear at <LOCATION> Squirrel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Vilas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. `` It was a very quiet last night,'' <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON> said. `` There were probably 40 or 45 protesters that showed up on <LOCATION> Squirrel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION>. But they were peaceful and quiet and there to observe and that was it.'' Some critics have said the police presence is too costly and possibly unwarranted. `` The taxpayers have to pay for this,'' said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Schnautc </PERSON> of Butternut, a spearfishing opponent. The state Division of Emergency Government estimated costs for the first five days of the season at about $ 50,000, said <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Kunelius </PERSON>, a Natural Resources spokesman. Local police, who began planning security in December, organized two backup units of 30 officers each from other areas in the state. The backup units are stationed in northern <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> during the spearfishing season. At <LOCATION> Butternut </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> _ the site last year of a protest that required more than 150 officers to keep peace _ about 75 officers were stationed on the boat landing before Indians or protesters arrived this year. `` There's obviously some areas where we anticipated trouble,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON>, chief administrator of law enforcement for the Department of Natural Resources. This year's problems have been mainly complaints that spearfishermen have been harassed by non-Indian boats creating waves, shining lights and splashing water near them. Gatherings at boat landings have been smaller this year than last, which authorities attribute partly to colder weather and partly to more visible security. `` I think it's great. We're getting cooperation from both sides,'' <PERSON> Bungi </PERSON> said Friday. `` I think everything's going smoothly.'' <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Maulson </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Lac </LOCATION> <LOCATION> du </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Flambeau </LOCATION> tribal judge and spearfishing organizer, applauded the police effort but said he wished it was not needed. `` It's just unfortunate that we have a lot of people watching us fish,'' he said. `` It's a shame that a few protesters have to cost the state of <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> so much money.''

 <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> came to <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> Sunday for the first time since he was expelled five years ago. <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> officials said <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> would end their split. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, his leadership beset by the April 16 assassination of his deputy, <PERSON> Khalil </PERSON> <PERSON> Wazir </PERSON>, flew in from <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> and visited <PERSON> Wazir </PERSON>'s grave <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s arrival in the Syrian capital capped a week-long mediation effort by <LOCATION> Libyan </LOCATION> leader Col. <PERSON> Moammar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> and Algerian President <PERSON> Chadli </PERSON> <PERSON> Benjedid </PERSON> to heal the rift between the onetime allies, <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> sources said on condition of anonymity. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s key political aide, <PERSON> Farouk </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaddoumi </PERSON>, also been working on the reconciliation, conducting negotiations in <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> since Tuesday. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> was accompanied by <PERSON> Salah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khalaf </PERSON>, who with <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> and <PERSON> Wazir </PERSON> founded the guerrilla's mainstream faction, <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION>. Lt. Col. <PERSON> Mustafa </PERSON> <PERSON> Kharroubi </PERSON>, a chief aide to <LOCATION> Libyan </LOCATION> leader Col. <PERSON> Moammar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON>, also was on the plane. Asked if he would meet with President <PERSON> Hafez </PERSON> <PERSON> Assad </PERSON>, <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> said, `` God willing.'' <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> and <PERSON> Khalaf </PERSON> drove to the Martyrs' Cemetry in <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION>' <LOCATION> Yarmouk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> refugee camp to pay tribute to <PERSON> Wazir </PERSON> Thousands of the camp's 220,000 refugees took to the streets to welcome the <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> leader. `` Blood and souls we sacrifice for you, <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Ammar </PERSON>,'' they chanted, invoking <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s nom de guerre. The refugees surrounded <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s car and then lifted it off the ground in an emotional demonstration of support. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> was expelled from <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> five years ago during a bloody feud with <PERSON> Assad </PERSON>. He had been expected to surmount his disagreements with <PERSON> Assad </PERSON> last week so he could fly to <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> for <PERSON> Wazir </PERSON>'s burial last Wednesday, but that plan failed. At least one <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> official said the imminent reconciliation was due to the death of <PERSON> Wazir </PERSON>, also known as <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Jihad </PERSON>. `` The martyrdom of <LOCATION> Abu </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jihad </LOCATION> certainly pushed the reconciliation forward,'' <PERSON> Bassam </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharif </PERSON>, <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s adviser, said in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION>. `` Joining hands with our <LOCATION> Syrian </LOCATION> brothers is the response for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s crime. <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Jihad </PERSON>'s blood is the bridge of unity for the forces fighting the Zionist occupation of Arab land,'' he said. Indeed, Palestinian factions, divided since the PLO-Syrian rift, all denounced <PERSON> Wazir </PERSON>'s killing and vowed revenge. They called for the reunification within the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> and a reconciliation with <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> as a response to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s apparent effort to weaken the movement. Israeli military sources have said <PERSON> Wazir </PERSON>, 52, was gunned down in <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION> by a commando unit in a raid planned by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Mossad </ORGANIZATION> intelligence agency. The Israeli government has not confirmed it. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> flew into <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> airport amid tight security. He was met at the plane by Interior Minister <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Harba </PERSON> and <PERSON> Saeed </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>, a member of the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Baath </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s regional command. There was little ceremony at the airport. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> is generally accorded a head-of-state welcome in Arab countries, which regard the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> as the sole representative of the world's 5 million Palestinians. But the Syrian government reacted cautiously to <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s first visit to <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> since he was kicked out June 24, 1983. The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> have been inching toward a rapprochement since <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> cut off relations with <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> in April 1987 and pro-Syrian <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> factions made peace with <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s mainstream <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION> faction of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, spearhead of <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> radicalism, has refused to make up with <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> until President <PERSON> Hosni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> cancels the March 1979 peace treaty that his predecessor, the late <PERSON> Anwar </PERSON> <PERSON> Sadat </PERSON>, signed with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> are adamantly opposed to separate peace deals with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. The Assad-Arafat feud erupted after <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s invasion of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in 1982 and the consequent evacuation of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> from its power base in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> at that time began looking into the prospects of negotiating peace with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. That angered <PERSON> Assad </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> radicals, who advocate armed struggle against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. In May 1983, the friction exploded into an all-out battle between <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s supporters and Syrian-backed hardliners seeking to oust the guerrilla chief from the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> leadership. By December that year, the dissidents had overrun <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s bases in east and north <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, forcing him to abandon his last Lebanese strongholds. By 1985, the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> had slowly infiltrated back into <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. That prompted the Syrian-backed Shiite Moslem Amal movement in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> to attack Palestinian refugee camps. The so-called `` war of the camps'' ended only three months ago as the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> inched toward a settlement.

<HEAD>Report: States Should Provide Prenatal Care For Poor Women</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 States should be required to provide health care for all pregnant women with incomes below the federal poverty standard, a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> committee recommended Sunday in a bipartisan report. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Government </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Operations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> said neonatal intensive care and other health and education expenses resulting from babies born prematurely cost three to 10 times as much as the prenatal care that often prevents premature births. The panel said that as of January, only 26 states were taking advantage of a two-year-old option to extend Medicaid to all pregnant women with incomes below the federal poverty level _ $ 9,690, for example, for a family of three. Three other states were planning to take up a 1987 option permitting expansion of the program to pregnant women with incomes up to 185 percent of the federal poverty level. `` Since the majority of women below the poverty line can not possibly afford health insurance, it is necessary to require Medicaid coverage for pregnant women below the federal poverty line,'' the report said. Had all states covered prenatal care, labor and delivery costs last year for such women, the report said, it would have cost the Medicaid program $ 190 million. The unanimously approved committee report was based on an investigation by the human resources subcommittee chaired by Rep. <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N </LOCATION>. Among other things, it recommended that the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> ensure that Medicaid reimbursement rates are fair in order to ease serious spot shortages of doctors willing to serve low-income women. The report said there are 15 <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> counties with no doctors that accept Medicaid maternity patients, and similar problems have been reported in the <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>. Citing various studies, the report said professional prenatal care, not including labor and delivery fees, costs about $ 400, while the lifetime cost of health and custodial care for a low-birthweight handicapped infant can amount to 100 times that much. About 40,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> infants born each year die before their first birthday, a rate higher than many other industrialized nations. A major cause of infant mortality is birthweight of less than 5.5 pounds. Research has repeatedly shown that the birth of such babies, also at high risk for having permanent handicaps of all kinds, can often be prevented with simple prenatal care. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has been allowing states to expand Medicaid to more low-income pregnant women and children each year, but has not required such coverage. States pay 50 to 80 percent of Medicaid costs. `` If we are serious about saving lives and cutting the federal deficit, we will immediately provide free prenatal care on the women who need it,'' <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON> said in a statement. `` Spending more money on prenatal care will save millions more in health care and special education and other services, this year and in years to come.''

 Democratic presidential contender <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> whistle-stopped across <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> on Sunday, promising help to economically strapped communities and suggesting Republican rival <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would rather build aircraft carriers than rebuilding roads and trains. `` I think I know where the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people are _ they are tired of crumbling bridges, congested airports, jammed highways, homeless people on streets and in doorways ... and they want a change,'' the Democratic front-runner said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, riding on his `` <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> Presidential Unlimited,'' also rejected as absurd suggestions from his remaining rival <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> that he should put forward a federal budget for a year hence. In <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Greensburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Johnstown </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Altoona </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor concentrated on economic development and jobs as he toured on the chartered <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION> train two days before the <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> primary. `` If we ca n't bring good jobs and economic opportunity back to the Johnstowns of this country, then there is something the matter with us,'' he told a crowd outside the train station in <LOCATION> Johnstown </LOCATION>. `` I believe we can. I believe we're going to.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> leads <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> in the polls here, but he campaigned hard, looking for a fourth straight big-state victory to cement his claim on the 1988 Democratic presidential nomination. Standing in a cold rain at the train station in <LOCATION> Greensburg </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> related the economic problems of the steel and coal towns to the problems in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> in the 1960s and 1970s. `` As a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Englander </LOCATION>, we went through the same kind of pain and economic distress as you have,'' he said. `` Our communities have come back and these communities are going to come back.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> rejected recent criticism from <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the Republican nominee-to-be, for his opposition to building two new super carrier task forces, that he said would cost $ 36 billion. `` If he thinks that's where we ought to put our scarce resources, then so be it. But it's going to be a fundamental issue in this campaign,'' he said, adding his litany of bridges, airports and highways that need rebuilding. In an interview on the train, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> hit <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION>. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> adminstration has proposed cutting off its government subsidies, a move some say would kill the system. `` What's he for? Is he for destroying <ORGANIZATION> Amtrak </ORGANIZATION>?'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` If he is, he ca n't conceiveably understand what it takes to build a strong economic future not only in the Northeast corridor, but all over this country?'' Then, adding a charge he has made sometimes against fellow Democrats, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>: `` He's never balanced a budget. I've had to make these tough choices.'' The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor rejected <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>'s suggestion that he put forward a proposed federal budget now. `` You ca n't prepare a budget now for next year _ that's absurd,'' he told reporters on the train `` I've been very specific,'' he added. ` You ca n't build a strong ecnomic future in the country unless it's based on on a very solid fiscal foundation and what the next president is going to have to do is a combination of deficit reduction and targeted investments and economic growth at the same time.'' Asked what he thought <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was doing with his pressure to put budget specifics out on the table, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> answered: `` I do n't know what he's trying to do.'' On education, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said: `` We're not going to run the nation's school system from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The thing a president has to do is to set some priorities and got after them.'' And at a news conference in <LOCATION> Johnstown </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> added: `` Any candidate who proposes a budget now for next year does n't know what budgeting is all about, could n't possibly imagine or understand what it is to put a budget together `` I'll lay out where I'm going to make the cuts _ I've done that in great detail. I'll lay out where I think we ought to do some investing _ I've done that in great detail.'' He referred to experience in 1975 _ when he had to go back on a no tax pledge because of budget deficits: `` I had to eat an awful lot of crow and I'm never going to make that mistake again ... If it is one thing I have learned very painfully is that you ca n't be drawing up budgets today for next year. No candidate knows exactly what you're going to confront.'' At the train station in <LOCATION> Johnstown </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> faced several dozen anti-abortion demonstrators who chanted slogans.

 An Iranian speedboat shot up a Saudi Arabian-owned tanker in the Strait of <LOCATION> Hormuz </LOCATION> on Sunday after President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> will no longer ignore attacks on noncombatants in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> region. The speedboat fired rocket-propelled grenades and machine guns at the 37,011-ton Sea Trader in the strait, the southern entrance to the gulf. An unexploded rocket dangled from the Sea Trader's hull after the attack but fell into the sea before the tanker reached the port of <LOCATION> Dubai </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION>. The Indian master, Capt. B.R. Pagarkar, reported his vessel sustained slight damage and no casualties among the Indian crew. It was not known whether any <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warships were near the Sea Trader during the attack. <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officials do not disclose warships' movements, but several <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> frigates and destroyers have been in the southern gulf since last week, when <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Iranian ships skirmished in the area <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> warned <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> in his weekly radio broadcast Saturday that continued attacks on neutral parties, including gulf shipping, `` will be very costly to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and its people.'' On Friday, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials disclosed in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> that the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration was planning to expand the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> naval role in the gulf by giving <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> commanders the right to intervene in Iranian attacks on non-U.S. flag vessels. Previously, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warships have only been permitted to provide `` humanitaran aid'' to non-American ships in distress and requesting aid, but not to intercede in armed conflict involving those ships. Gulf-based shipping executives, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the Sea Trader encountered a flotilla of six armed speedboats as it sailed into the gulf through the strait about 7:30 a.m. -LRB- 11:30 p.m. EDT Saturday -RRB-. The tanker, owned by a Saudi firm but flying the <LOCATION> Liberian </LOCATION> flag, was bound for the <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> oil port of <PERSON> Ras </PERSON> <PERSON> Tanura </PERSON>. <PERSON> Pagarkar </PERSON> said five of the speedboats `` went in one direction while one appeared to be heading for another tanker, and I thought we'd escaped an attack. But suddenly it veered toward my ship, asking for the master.'' The executives quoted him as saying the speedboat opened fire after the Iranians demanded the ship's destination and indicated they intended to board it. There was nothing to directly link the raid on the Sea Trader to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s comments or to an earlier report that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was preparing to adopt a new get-tough policy following last week's skirmishes between <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> But the attack, the first since two ships were hit Tuesday in the aftermath of a major U.S.-Iranian clash the day before, suggested <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> was determined to show its ability to carry out shipping raids despite its losses. In the skirmishes April 18, <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> forces sank or damaged a half-dozen of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s armed craft, including two frigates that have regularly operated in the strait and nearby waters. There have been no reports since April 8 of Iraqi air strikes on Iranian oil tankers, the type of attacks for which <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> customarily retaliates by striking at neutral vessels. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s last reported action in the gulf was Friday, when the official Iraqi news agency said <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>'s forces sunk a small Iranian naval craft. That claim was not confirmed by ndependent sources or <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, which is fighting a 7 -LCB- - year-old war with <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military sources, speaking anonymously, said <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> apparently fired its only remaining Harpoon anti-ship missile during the skirmishes April 18. The weapon was one of nine given to the Iranian navy by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> during the rule of <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Reza </PERSON> <PERSON> Pahlavi </PERSON>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence sources told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in September that evidence indicated <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> had one operational Harpoon and made a practice of mounting it on a Kaman-class boat `` just for show.'' It was fired by a Kaman-class patrol boat in an encounter with the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> guided missile frigate <PERSON> Wainwright </PERSON> and the guided missile frigate <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> during the April 18 skirmishes. The Iranian patrol boat fired at the 8,200-ton <PERSON> Wainwright </PERSON> from a distance of about 12 miles. The sources said the <PERSON> Wainwright </PERSON> fired defensive `` chaff'' rockets, filled with shards of aluminum and other materials, to confuse the missile's radar guidance system. The missile sailed over the cruiser and fell into the water. Almost simultaneously, the <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> fired a Harpoon that destroyed the Iranian boat.

<HEAD>Government Economist Sees Big Economic, Pleasure Loss In Smaller
Cars</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy would lose $ 4.80 for every gallon of gas saved in steering car buyers away from the `` convenience and pleasure'' of bigger cars, according to a government economist. The economist, <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kleit </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> staff, argues that car buyers should not be induced to give up big cars and says just as much fuel would be saved by an additional tax on gasoline of 2 or 3 cents a gallon. `` People clearly get pleasure from buying large cars and I do n't see anything illicit in that at all,'' <PERSON> Kleit </PERSON> said in an interview about his report, `` The Impact of Automobile Fuel Economy Standards. He said the report represents his own views and not those of the <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economics </ORGANIZATION> which published it as Working Paper No. 160. At the urging of <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> lowered the standard manufactures must meet from an average of 27.5 miles per gallon for all their cars to 26 mpg for 1986 and 1987 cars. It was kept at 26 mpg for 1988, but will revert to 27.5 mpg for the 1989 model year unless the department acts again. <PERSON> Kleit </PERSON>'s study of 1986 and 1987 models, which he says represents his own views and not those of the commission, is being used by people who are trying to abolish these Corporate Average Fuel Economy, or CAFE, standards. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> imposed the standards in 1975 because it was spooked by the 1973 Arab oil embargo and long gasoline lines. The standards were meant as a fuel-saving alternative to higher taxes on fuel or imported crude oil. Higher standards are supported by environmentalists who want to see less fossil fuel burned. Opponents of the higher standards include auto safety proponents who estimate that a 1 mpg increase in the standard for 1989 cars could mean an extra 220 to 390 deaths a year for a decade. Large cars are generally considered safer than small ones. To have met the higher standard in 1986 and 1987, <PERSON> Kleit </PERSON> said in an interview, about a million buyers would have had to switch from large to small cars. The only way to do this, he said, would have been to raise the price of the average domestic large car by about $ 1,200 and lower the price of the average domestic small car by about $ 800. He said buyers would not have spent the $ 3.3 billion they were willing to put up for the satisfaction of owning and driving larger cars _ `` that many dollars worth of convenience and pleasure,'' as shown by the difference in the prices of large cars people bought and small ones they would have bought. Profits to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> manufacturers would have been $ 111 million less _ declines at <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> partially offset by increases at <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> _ so the loss to the economy would have been the sum of the two numbers, more than $ 3.4 billion, <PERSON> Kleit </PERSON> said. About 712 million gallons of gasoline would be saved over the lives of the cars, <PERSON> Kleit </PERSON> calculated. So the cost per gallon saved would have been simply $ 3.4 billion divided by this number of gallons _ $ 4.80 in round figures. Different assumptions could make it anywhere from $ 3.71 to $ 6.21, he said. `` While CAFE policy can save gasoline, it does so at a prohibitive cost to the economy,'' <PERSON> Kleit </PERSON> wrote. One of his critics, <PERSON> Tina </PERSON> <PERSON> Hobson </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Renew </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Project </ORGANIZATION>, a group advocating conservation and use of renewable energy sources, said <PERSON> Kleit </PERSON>'s work ignored `` the need to disconnect macho from cars. ... We need to unlink car ownership from personal satisfaction.'' <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Durning </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Worldwatch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, coauthor of a recent paper urging more conservation, said of <PERSON> Kleit </PERSON>'s proposition, `` It's a bit of fancy footwork about a fine point.

 It was n't just another week at the small federal courthouse here, and it looks like more to come as <PERSON> Mick </PERSON> <PERSON> Jagger </PERSON> takes the stand again Monday in the trial over whether he plagiarized his 1985 hit `` Just Another Night.'' Excited fans, autograph-seeking court employees, rumors of free concerts and milling reporters have turned the rock star's court battle into a circus. The unimposing, cramped court, a former office building converted in 1983, is 25 miles north and light years away from the majestic Beaux Arts federal courthouse in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Foley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> where the suit was first filed. The building has a single elevator and only four telephones _ a frustration for the horde of reporters who've come from as far away as <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>. The building hosted the yearlong Chapter 11 bankruptcy case of <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>, but even that high-profile event did n't prepare the courthouse for what would happen when a rock legend came to town. It began when <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Alley </PERSON>, a 36-year-old reggae musician from the <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION>, filed a lawsuit Jan. 2, 1986, charging <PERSON> Jagger </PERSON> with copyright infringement over the song's chorus. The suit was filed in <LOCATION> Foley </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> and was assigned to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Gerard </PERSON> <PERSON> Goettel </PERSON>. <PERSON> Goettel </PERSON> was later transferred to <LOCATION> White </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION> and the case moved north. <PERSON> Jagger </PERSON> managed one day of obscurity when the trial opened April 18, but the media was alerted Tuesday and by Wednesday, <PERSON> Goettel </PERSON>'s fourth-floor courtroom was beginning to fill with reporters and excited fans It was on Wednesday that <PERSON> Jagger </PERSON> greeted a handful of journalists at the start of the day with a `` How are we all today?'' He said he was battling the case because his `` credibility was on the line.'' It was also Wednesday that one of <PERSON> Jagger </PERSON>'s lawyers, <PERSON> Helene </PERSON> <PERSON> Freeman </PERSON>, was stopped by federal marshals as she entered the building and brought before <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Magistrate <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON>. <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON> ordered the lawyer to get autographs for his two daughters, his law clerk and secretary. Later that day, drummer <PERSON> Lowell </PERSON> `` Sly'' <PERSON> Dunbar </PERSON> took the stand and played his testimony, prompting a recess in a fraud case on the third floor. <PERSON> Dunbar </PERSON> is alleged to have performed on both recordings, but testified he could not remember drumming for Alley's recording made in 1979. <PERSON> Jagger </PERSON> gave out autographs to the growing mob of fans. Thursday word got out that <PERSON> Jagger </PERSON> was going to testify and maybe even play because his guitar and equipment were set up in the courtroom. Rumors of a free concert spread and by Friday the crowds were tremendous, causing the building security force to limit entry. If a spectator left the courtroom, which seats about 50 uncomfortably, for any reason, that was it. He was replaced. Throughout the three hours of <PERSON> Jagger </PERSON>'s afternoon testimony, all seats were filled. <PERSON> Jagger </PERSON> never did sing, but tapes of the song were played _ over and over _ with even the jury swaying to the beat and the judge, who said he does n't like rock music, occasionally looking pained. A spirited recitation of `` Jumpin' <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Flash </PERSON>,'' to demonstrate how repetition was used in his music, was as close as <PERSON> Jagger </PERSON> came to a concert.

<HEAD>Figure in Insider Trading Probe to Testify to Congress</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 When <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>, the king of junk bond financing, appears before a congressional committee this week, more will be on members' minds than the role of high-risk, high-yield bonds in the nation's economy. <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> is a pioneer in the use of so-called junk bonds in corporate takeovers and also a key figure in the government's investigation into Wall Street's insider trading scandal. He would be the first central player in the insider trading scandal to testify in public. A staff member for the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee said the panel has steered clear of attempting to learn the direction of insider trading probes by the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's office in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>. `` We've done that deliberately so <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> could not say at a later date that we were using the congressional process to squeeze them,'' the aide said, speaking on condition of anonymity. Because of that, the aide said, problems associated with junk bond financing, not insider trading, will be the focus of this week's hearings. Even so, <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>'s attorneys have indicated to the subcommittee `` there is a good chance he will claim the Fifth Amendment,'' the staffer said. <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> disclosed in February that the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> had notified the firm that its staff planned to recommend civil charges against the firm and some of its employees for securities law violations. The firm has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing. Since the indictment nearly a year and a half ago of speculator <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>, members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> have been hungry for news about the progress or lack of progress in the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> probe. They've gotten little to allay their curiosity. Last May, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Shad </PERSON>, then <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> chairman, told senators they could expect to see `` succession of shoes dropping through the summer.'' No shoes fell, and in December, Sen. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, D-Mich., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on securities, pressed <PERSON> Shad </PERSON>'s successor, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruder </PERSON>, for an explanation <PERSON> Ruder </PERSON> said he expected additional `` major cases,'' but said the cases were `` exceedingly complicated'' and their completion months away. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on investigations, which subpoenaed <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> to appear Wednesday, has also been examining the insider-trading scandal. <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> chief executive <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> is scheduled to appear Thursday. The investigations subcommittee met behind closed doors last June to hear from <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Levine </PERSON>, a merger specialist at <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> who was convicted of securities fraud and is now serving a sentence at federal prison in <LOCATION> Lewisburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>. Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON>, D-Mich., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and its investigations subcommittee, has said he also would like to call <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>, who is in federal prison at <LOCATION> Lompoc </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> is the architect of <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>'s pioneering <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, - based business in junk bonds, which have been frequently used to help finance corporate takeovers like those in Critics of corporate takeovers maintain that the buildup of thinly secured debt is dangerous to the economy. Meanwhile, concern in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> about the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> investigation has not gone away. <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON>, in December, had asked for a letter from <LOCATION> Ruder </LOCATION> on the status of the probe and received what a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> staff member, who spoke on condition of anonymity, described as a `` pro forma'' response. The aide said <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON>, D-Wis., is also anxious to see results `` I think <PERSON> Proxmire </PERSON> will probably wait until the end of the summer and then ... seek some satisfaction why this investigation is taking so long. We wo n't drop the ball, but at the same time we have a lot of confidence in the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> and the prosecutor's office in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>,'' the aide said.

<HEAD>Stella Nickell's Daughter To Testify Against Her In Tampering
Trial</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The daughter of a woman on trial in the drug-tampering deaths of her husband and another person takes the stand this week, and prosecutors say she will testify her mother repeatedly discussed ways to get rid of her stepfather. Authorities say <PERSON> Stella </PERSON> <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON>, the first person in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to be tried on federal charges of causing death by tampering with over-the-counter capsules, plotted to kill <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON> to collect insurance. The cyanide poisoning deaths contributed to a nationwide tampering scare, and Excedrin manufacturer Bristol-Myers recalled all its non-prescription medicine sold in capsule form. <PERSON> Cindy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>, Mrs. <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON>'s daughter, was scheduled to testify Monday. The government alleges that over several years Mrs. <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON> discussed drugs and overdoses and hit men with her daughter, and eventually began interjecting her husband's name into the conversations. The marriage was unhappy, but Mrs. <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON> was determined not to lose her trailer home in <LOCATION> Auburn </LOCATION>, a suburb between <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tacoma </LOCATION>, in a divorce, prosecutors say. Witnesses have testified that the <PERSON> Nickells </PERSON> were several thousand dollars in debt when <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON> died in June 1986, and faced foreclosure on the home. But <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hillier </PERSON>, the federal public defender representing Mrs. <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON>, said Ms. <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> is not a credible witness, had been a drug abuser, and was probably thinking of the $ 300,000 reward established by a pharmaceutical group when she contacted the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> in January 1987. Mrs. <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON> is charged in the 1986 deaths of <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON>, 52, and of <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Katherine </PERSON> <PERSON> Snow </PERSON>, 40, also of <LOCATION> Auburn </LOCATION>, and accused of putting cyanide in capsules of Extra-Strength Excedrin. The prosecution has suggested no links between the victims except the manner of their deaths, and says that Mrs. <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON> planted cyanide-tainted capsules in local stores to divert suspicion after she poisoned her husband. Mrs. <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON> also faces three counts of tampering with a product involved in interstate commerce in the tainting of capsules in two Extra-Strength Excedrin bottles and an Anacin-3 bottle that were recovered in stores in <LOCATION> Auburn </LOCATION> and nearby <LOCATION> Kent </LOCATION>. In the first two days of testimony last week, <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON> said Mrs. <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON> told him she was n't interested in benefiting financially from her husband's death, but denied that there were three life insurance policies. Mrs. <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON> said in November 1986 that her husband had only a $ 25,000 state employees life insurance policy, <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON> testified. But witnesses testified that policy was really worth $ 31,000 if <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON> had died of natural causes, and $ 136,000 if he died of accidental causes. That's why Mrs. <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON> pressed medical authorities for a more specific cause of death when they initially ruled he died of emphysema, said Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Joanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Maida </PERSON>. It was only after Ms. Snow's death was confirmed as caused by acute cyanide poisoning that <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON>'s cause of death was re-examined. Prosecutors say they will present two additional insurance policies worth $ 20,000 each, including at least one on which Mrs. <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON> allegedly forged her husband's name. The total benefits of the three policies could have reached $ 176,000. In his opening statement, <PERSON> Hillier </PERSON> told jurors there are reasonable explanations for many of the prosecution's points, and that the government's case is largely circumstantial. He said Mrs. <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON> will take the stand and contradict her daughter's testimony. Trial resumes Monday with the continuation of testimony by <PERSON> Bonnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, a former co-worker of Mrs. <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON>'s. Ms. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> testified last week that on the day after <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON> died, she was with Mrs. <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON> when she told Ms. <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> about her stepfather's death. `` She looked <PERSON> Cindy </PERSON> straight in the eye and said, ` I know what you're thinking and the answer is no,''' Ms. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> testified. Ms. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> also said Mrs. <PERSON> Nickell </PERSON> had discussed marital problems when the two worked as security officers at <LOCATION> Seattle-Tacoma </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. `` She said she liked being on the late shift because she did n't have to see so much of <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON>,'' Ms. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said

 Investigators searching for the cause of two explosions that destroyed a grain elevator examined the rubble Sunday after recovering the last body of five workers killed in the blasts. `` There's a strong possibility'' that ignited grain dust sparked the explosions that flattened the <ORGANIZATION> ADM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Growmark </ORGANIZATION> granary but `` it could be days'' before the exact cause and origin of the blasts are pinpointed, <LOCATION> Joliet </LOCATION> Fire Chief <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Plese </PERSON> said Sunday. Airborne grain dust can be highly explosive. After working non-stop for about 29 hours, about 100 volunteers and professionals using cranes and bulldozers uncovered the bodies of three workers Saturday who had been missing since Friday's explosion, <PERSON> Plese </PERSON> said The last of the five victims were found in the basement of the granary, crushed by the wave of corn and soybeans that had swept them there, the chief said. The bodies were discovered within half an hour of each other at the complex on the <LOCATION> Des </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plaines </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> about 40 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, said police detective <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Horvath </PERSON>. `` As far as I can tell from the preliminary examinations at the scene there was no burning on these bodies,'' Will County Deputy Coroner <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferguson </PERSON> said Saturday night. `` Indications are that they would have died instantly from the injuries.'' Officials finally ruled out a witness' report that the blasts had blown a worker off a barge and into the river, and a search of the river was called off, <PERSON> Plese </PERSON> said. Authorities believe that airborne grain dust was ignited in the first explosion, which apparently ruptured a natural gas main and touched off a second blast moments later, <PERSON> Plese </PERSON> said. The blasts turned the 100-foot silos at the site into 30-foot-high mounds of twisted steel, reinforced concrete and 70,000 bushels of corn and soybeans, <PERSON> Plese </PERSON> said. `` We had to dig through all of that to get at these people who were buried,'' he said by phone Sunday from <LOCATION> Joliet </LOCATION>. By late Saturday, when the bodies of the missing men were found, most of the debris had been hauled away to a nearby landfill, he said. Investigators from the Illinois office of the <ORGANIZATION> Occupational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> impounded much of the structural steel, <PERSON> Plese </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Plese </PERSON> said he was moved by the help from local construction trade unions, trucking and wrecking companies and fire departments in the area who volunteered in the rescue effort. About 60 volunteers joined the estimated 40 workers at the scene who sifted through rubble `` non-stop from the time it blew up until we dug them out,'' he said. The victims found Saturday were identified as <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Zack </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Joliet </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> McLaughlin </PERSON>, 18, of <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dupuis </PERSON>, 23, of <PERSON> Bourbonnais </PERSON>, said the deputy coroner. The bodies of <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>, 20, of <LOCATION> Princeton </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Slatton </PERSON>, 28, of <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, were found Friday.

 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Karnes </PERSON> faces a tough battle in the Republican primary May 10, and even if he survives that, he is not expected to fare well against popular ex-Gov. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerrey </PERSON> in November. <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> voters will have to look closely to find substantial differences between <PERSON> Karnes </PERSON> and his primary challenger, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Hal </PERSON> <PERSON> Daub </PERSON>, both of whom espouse a conservative philosophy, according to <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> stalwarts. `` The major difference I see in them is probably in style,'' said state <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Norm </PERSON> <PERSON> Riffel </PERSON>. Their similarity may be making the decision a hard one for voters in the primary. A March poll taken for the <ORGANIZATION> Omaha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World-Herald </ORGANIZATION> showed <PERSON> Karnes </PERSON> favored 42 percent to 38 percent, but that's with a margin of error of 5.1 percentage points. A December poll showed <PERSON> Daub </PERSON> with a 5-point lead. While an incumbent does n't usually face a tough primary fight, <PERSON> Karnes </PERSON> did n't take office by the usual route. A political unknown, he was appointed in March 1987 by Republican Gov. <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> <PERSON> Orr </PERSON> to fill the unexpired term of the late Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Zorinsky </PERSON>, a Democrat. <PERSON> Daub </PERSON>, a four-term congressman from the Omaha-dominated 2nd District, was one of the better-known <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> regulars who sought the appointment. `` He has been appointed and not elected. That's the main difference between us. I've laid it on the line,'' <PERSON> Daub </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Karnes </PERSON>' future may be linked to the political popularity of Mrs. <PERSON> Orr </PERSON>. A March poll taken for the <ORGANIZATION> World-Herald </ORGANIZATION> found that her popularity rating was 48 percent, the first time it was below 50 percent in her 14 months in office. <PERSON> Daub </PERSON> has indirectly argued that <PERSON> Karnes </PERSON> is the governor's candidate and thus may be vulnerable if Nebraskans are unhappy with her Whatever happens in the primary, the winner will have to face <PERSON> Kerrey </PERSON>, whose popularity has bedeviled the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> for years. <PERSON> Kerrey </PERSON> faces token opposition in the Democratic primary from <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Michaelis </PERSON>, who was disbarred in 1982 for what the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> called `` scurrilous attacks upon the bar and bench.'' <PERSON> Kerrey </PERSON> was virtually unknown when he stepped from private life into the governor's race in 1982 and, in his first political effort, defeated incumbent Republican <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Thone </PERSON>. His one-time romantic relationship with actress <PERSON> Debra </PERSON> <PERSON> Winger </PERSON>, and her frequent and lengthy stays at the governor's mansion, appeared to only endear <PERSON> Kerrey </PERSON> further to Nebraskans. The hallmark of <PERSON> Kerrey </PERSON>'s style has been his willingness to adjust positions on important issues, ranging from school district consolidation to pay raises for state employees, whenever he thought necessary.

<TEXT>
 The death toll from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s worst car bombing in three years climbed to 69 Sunday after 15 of the wounded died in hospitals. One man was dragged injured but alive from a wrecked building. <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION>'s eight hospitals were filled to capcity with casualties and morgues were `` packed with corpses,'' police said. Local officials in the northern port city declared two days of public mourning for the victims of Saturday's explosion in a crowded vegetable market that knocked down buildings and set dozens of cars ablaze. Police said 111 people were wounded from the blast in the low-income <LOCATION> Tabbaneh </LOCATION> district of <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION>, the country's second-largest city Radio stations broadcast urgent appeals for blood. Civil defense rescue teams who clawed through the rubble during the night called off their search early Sunday after dragging the 33-year-old survivor, a grocer, to safety at about midnight, police reported. The man, who was not identified, had been buried for more than 16 hours. He was taken to <LOCATION> Batroun </LOCATION> hospital, 15 miles south of <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION>, because the city's hospitals were already overflowing with casualties. Police said no one else was listed as missing or believed to be buried in the wreckage. <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION>, whose 850,000 population is predominantly Sunni Moslem, is 50 miles north of the capital, <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION>'s coordination committee, senior civil servants and local notables who run the day-to-day affairs of the city, on Sunday drew up funeral plans for the victims while shops and businesses closed in mourning. The committee was formed to handle municipal affairs because the central government's authority has been eroded by the country's 13-year-old civil war between Moslems and Christians Police said a black pickup truck used in Saturday's bombing was loaded with vegetables and 330 pounds of TNT. It exploded while the market was filled with shoppers on the seventh day of <ORGANIZATION> Islam </ORGANIZATION>'s holy month of <LOCATION> Ramadan </LOCATION>, when devout Moslems fast from sunrise to sunset. No group has claimed responsibility for Saturday's bombing, and police said they had no clues about who was behind the carnage. Earlier car bombings have been blamed on the civil war hostilities as well as other feuds involving Palestinians, Syrians and Israelis in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. More than 130,000 people have been killed since the war broke out in April 1975. Saturday's atrocity was the first major car bombing in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> this year. It was the bloodiest car bombing in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> since March 8, 1985, when 80 people were killed and 250 wounded in the Shiite Moslem district of <LOCATION> Bir </LOCATION> <LOCATION> el-Abed </LOCATION> in south <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. Another car bomb exploded outside an ice cream parlor in <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION> June 29, 1985. Sixty people were killed and 110 wounded. There were 16 car bombings in 1987 in which 57 people were killed and 288 wounded.

<HEAD>Judge Dislikes Law Which Led To His Ruling That Brom Be Tried As
Juvenile</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ROCHESTER, Minn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A judge said he does not agree with trying a 16-year-old as a juvenile for the ax slayings of his parents and two siblings but insisted the law gives him no choice. District Judge <PERSON> Gerard </PERSON> <PERSON> Ring </PERSON> said Friday he hopes the case will prompt the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> to review the law on juvenile crime. `` Under the present law, I can give the same disposition to a juvenile for stealing a Baby Ruth candy bar as for murdering baby <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON>,'' he said. `` I have never agreed with that.'' Ring denied a motion to have <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Brom </PERSON> tried as an adult on charges of murdering his parents, <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> and <PERSON> Paulette </PERSON> <PERSON> Brom </PERSON>, his brother <PERSON> Ricky </PERSON>, 11, and sister, <PERSON> Diane </PERSON>, 14, at the family's home Feb. 18. If Brom is convicted as a juvenile, he will be released at age 19 or when he has been deemed rehabilitated, whichever comes first. If triedas an adult and convicted, he would face a life sentence with parole eligibility after about 17 -LCB- years. To try a juvenile as an adult, state law requires the prosecutor to show that the child is not suited to rehabilitative treatment and is a danger to the community. Ring wrote in a ruling released Friday that neither standard applied to <LOCATION> Brom </LOCATION>, who was described by a court-appointed psychiatrist as `` deferential, polite, and compliant,'' and had no prior record. `` I do n't agree at all with the outcome,'' the judge said. At the same time, he said, `` I know the decision was the correct one legally.'' Olmsted County Attorney <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmitz </PERSON> said he will appeal the ruling. Sheriff <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Von </PERSON> <PERSON> Wald </PERSON> and Police Chief <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrell </PERSON> complained that the ruling focused too much on rehabilitation and not punishment. But Ring countered, `` There is nothing in the statute about punishment. And it does require consideration of treatment.'' He said he disagrees with the juvenile court concept that looks only to the child's needs. The psychiatrist, Dr. <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Malmquist </PERSON>, testified earlier this month that <PERSON> Brom </PERSON> described the killings to him and that depression made <PERSON> Brom </PERSON> suicidal and eventually homicidal. An older brother, <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON>, 19, lived away from the <LOCATION> Brom </LOCATION> home and is the only other survivor of the immediate family.

<HEAD>Education Secretary Says School System `Still At Risk'</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: The Bennett report was embargoed for release on Tuesday, but
the embargo has been broken</NOTE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Education Secretary <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> says the American education system has made little progress in the five years since a searing report called `` A Nation At Risk'' warned that the system was sinking below `` a rising tide of mediocrity.'' The school system, <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> says in a report to be formally delivered to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on Tuesday, `` is still at risk.'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> acknowledged that `` American education has made some undeniable progress in the last few years. ... We are doing better than we were in 1983. `` But,'' he wrote, `` we are certainly not doing well enough, and we are not doing well enough fast enough. We are still at risk. The absolute level at which our improvements are taking place is unacceptably low.'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> decried the dropout rate, poor education of those who do graduate from high school, the widely varying quality of school curricula, the rarity of good schools for disadvantaged and minority children, and the manner of promoting teachers and principals `` that make excellence a matter of chance, not design.'' He cited a recent Gallup Poll that found a wide majority of Americans favoring school reforms, but said `` future reforms face serious obstacles.'' `` Above all, sound education reforms are threatened by the determined opposition they elicit,'' <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said, pointing to `` what might be called opposition by extortion, the false claim that to fix our schools will first require a fortune in new funding.'' In addition, <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> said, `` More and more, the opposition to school reform is now manifested in the narrow, self-interested exercise of political power in statehouse corridors and local school board meetings. Almost without fail, wherever a worthwhile school proposal or legislative initiative is under consideration, those with a vested interest in the educational status quo will use political muscle to block reform. And too often the anti-reformers succeed. ... If our schools are to improve, that power must be overcome.'' Many experts agree that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> school system needs upgrading, but some say the federal government is part of the problem. <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatwood </PERSON> <PERSON> Futrell </PERSON> has charged that school reform is `` withering on the vine'' due to lack of federal funds. The union will mark the fifth anniversary of the release of the `` Nation At Risk'' report with a protest Tuesday in <LOCATION> Lafayette </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION> across the street from the White House. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Shanker </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teachers </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` There's no evidence that reform is working for any of our kids, except maybe the 20 percent who have always made it in the traditional school system.'' <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> of the States has found that 45 states and the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> have raised graduation standards since 1980. The average high school student in 1987 had to take nearly 20 units of credit to graduate, up from 17 in 1980. However, the <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>, led by top business executives, and the <ORGANIZATION> Carnegie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> for the Advancement of Teaching have concluded that school reforms have had little or no impact on urban schools. The `` Nation At Risk'' report was prepared by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Excellence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> in </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION>, a panel of 18 citizens appointed by then-Secretary of Education T.H. Bell in August 1981 to address `` the widespread public perception that something is seriously remiss in our educational system.'' `` The educational foundations of our society are presently being eroded by a rising tide of mediocrity that threatens our very future as a nation and a people,'' the report said.

 Voters in <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>'s smaller cities and municipal districts cast ballots Sunday for mayors and city councils in the country's first elections since a civilian government took office in January 1986. Nearly 1.3 million people were registered to vote in the elections in 271 municipalities with populations under 20,000. Mayors and councils in the 51 larger cities were elected to 5-year terms in 1985. Under the 1986 constitution, the terms for municipal offices are for 30 months. When the terms expire in the 51 cities in 1990 the new office holders will serve for 30 months. President <PERSON> Vinicio </PERSON> <PERSON> Cerezo </PERSON>'s centrist <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> holds 148 of the 271 mayoralties that were contested Sunday.

 A man who raped and savagely mutilated a teen-age girl nine years ago will finish his parole Monday, paying his legal debt in full. But it's unlikely the crime will ever stop dogging him or haunting his victim. `` I never live in the past,'' <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON>, 60, said in a recent television interview. But he continually argues that he was innocent, and public outrage follows him wherever he goes. `` I'll never get over this,'' says <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON>. <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON> hacked off her forearms with an ax on Sept. 29, 1978, and left her for dead in <LOCATION> Stanislaus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, east of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. Acquaintances say both convict and victim feel oppressed by the public's continued interest in them; neither would consent to an interview. <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON>, who lives in seclusion in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION>, has said in published interviews that her fear has been revived by <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON>'s impending freedom. Parole officials and <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON>'s friends are concerned about his safety wherever he tries to settle. When he was released a year ago on parole, furious protests followed him from town to town when state officials tried to find a place for him to live. He wound up in a mobile home on the grounds of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Quentin </LOCATION> prison, and last week officials moved him to an undisclosed location. `` Here's a girl who lost her arms and will never get them back, and here's the guy who did it. He got 14 years and he's out in eight,'' said <LOCATION> Stanislaus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Stahl </PERSON>, who prosecuted <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON>. `` There ai n't no justice _ it's the thing I hear over and over and over from everyone,'' he said. <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON> himself claims justice was not done, insisting someone else attacked and maimed <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON>, who was hitchiking. He also claims she attacked him. But in 1979, a jury in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> convicted the former merchant sailor of kidnap, rape, mayhem and attempted murder in the attack on <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON>, then 15 years old. <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> was discovered naked, with her forearms hacked off, on a rural road. She told police her attacker was a man named <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> who picked her up in <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION> and told her he would take her to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> but instead took her to a deserted area near <LOCATION> Modesto </LOCATION>. She also identified <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON>. <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON> was arrested 10 days later in <LOCATION> Sparks </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nev. </LOCATION>. Detectives found the burned remains of <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON>'s clothes in the fireplace of <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON>'s house in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pablo </LOCATION> <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON> was sentenced to 14 years and four months in prison, then the legal maximum. He was released early on parole in April 1987 because of good behavior and work credits. On Monday, <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON> will be free to go wherever he likes and is under no obligation to tell prison officials where he is going. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Clyde </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, pastor of Bride of <ORGANIZATION> Christ </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Azalea </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, said Wednesday that <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON> called him April 14 to accept his offer to let him join the church, where he would have work and a place to live. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON> told him he planned to visit relatives in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> first. Parole officials have said <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON> should be a law-abiding citizen, if he is given a chance and if he continues to abstain from alcohol. He was drinking heavily the day of the attack on <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON>. <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON> took a polygraph test arranged by a local public television station on April 16, and his answers showed he believes the truth of his denials, according to polygraph expert <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> Connolly </PERSON>. Many, including <PERSON> Stahl </PERSON>, still fear <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON> is dangerous. And residents of <LOCATION> Azalea </LOCATION> object to the idea of him settling there. <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON> <PERSON> Almeida </PERSON>, vice president of the Torrance-based <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Victims </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Equal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> and herself a victim of a violent crime, put herself in <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON>'s place. `` I would feel so frightened. I would be constantly looking over my shoulder, looking for him,'' <PERSON> Almeida </PERSON> said. `` It's the thought: ` He will find me. If he wants to badly enough, he will find me.'''

<TEXT>
 The archbishop of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> said Sunday he believes the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and Sandinista government ultimately will hold talks despite President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s staunch support of the Nicaraguan rebels. Roman Catholic Cardinal <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Obando </PERSON> y <PERSON> Bravo </PERSON> said peace talks between the government and the rebels, known as Contras, may be a prelude to bilateral talks between the Sandinistas and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` I am not a political expert,'' he said. `` But I believe that as the Nicaraguan government moves toward democratization and it and the Contras fulfill the peace agreements, the time will come when the two -LRB- <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> -RRB- will sit down face to face. `` Remember that the same was said about the -LRB- Contra -RRB- peace talks. Remember how the government here said the stars would fall from the sky before any talks. It is a wise man that changes his mind.'' <PERSON> Obando </PERSON> <PERSON> y </PERSON> <PERSON> Bravo </PERSON>, who acted as mediator during initial talks between the rebels and government, spoke with reporters after Mass at the La Sierrita church. He was asked about President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>'s request for talks with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> on Friday said the two countries should resume discussions on `` matters of security'' in the Mexican seaside resort of <LOCATION> Manzanillo </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has not responded. U.S.-Nicaraguan talks were held in <LOCATION> Manzanillo </LOCATION> in 1984. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration broke off the dialogue in January 1985. The rebels and <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> signed a preliminary peace accord in the southern border town of <LOCATION> Sapoa </LOCATION> on March 23. It called for a 60-day cease-fire that began April 1. During the truce the two sides are to attempt to negotiate an end to the 6 -LCB- - year-old conflict that has cost more than 26,000 lives They have held meetings recently in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Obando </PERSON> y <PERSON> Bravo </PERSON> said he expected the second round of the Contra-Sandinista peace talks in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> to begin as scheduled on Thursday. `` I believe that even though a peace treaty has not been signed, much has been advanced. I know the climate of the negotations from the beginning when things were very tense,'' he said. `` I think advances will continue to be made. We are Nicaraguans and we must reach a settlement. Our young people are tired of the war. Our people are tired of the war, tired of scarcity, tired of everything.'' The cardinal is a member of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reconciliation </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Verification </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, established to determine if the two sides abide by the peace agreements.

<HEAD>Shoppers Had Only Minutes To Evacuate Before Store Roof Failed</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BURNABY, British Columbia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A supermarket opening billed as a chance to `` discover the extraordinary'' became just that when a rooftop parking lot collapsed into the crowded store, injuring 24 people. Hundreds of shoppers scrambled for the exits as the roof of the 100,000-square-foot Save-On-Foods store gave way Saturday, dropping concrete slabs and 22 cars into the supermarket. Three of the injured remained in hospitals in stable condition Sunday. Provincial authorities were called in to investigate the cause of the collapse, said Staff Sgt. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Shauer </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canadian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mounted </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. About 600 shoppers and 300 employees attending a senior citizens' preview of the opening of $ 15 million store. Newspaper ads for the store had proclaimed: `` Escape the ordinary _ discover the extraordinary.'' Witnesses said shoppers had about four minutes to clear out after a broken water pipe prompted store officials to tell shoppers over a public address system to leave the store immediately. `` I'd just turned my back for one second and down it came. There was suddenly a tremendous gust of wind at my back as I ran,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Klein </PERSON>, a free-lance photographer. Some customers were slow to heed calls to evacuate. `` Some of them wanted to keep on shopping,'' said <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Clyde </PERSON> of nearby <LOCATION> Coquitlam </LOCATION>. `` A lot of them did n't want to leave their buggies until they got their quarters -LRB- deposits -RRB- back.'' Minutes earlier, <PERSON> Save-On-Foods </PERSON> owner <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Pattison </PERSON>, whose chain leased space in the huge Metrotown shopping complex in this <LOCATION> Vancouver </LOCATION> suburb, had cut a ribbon under the point where the 10,000-square-foot roof section thundered to the floor. `` It could have been a lot worse,'' said <PERSON> Pattison </PERSON>. <PERSON> Trevor </PERSON> <PERSON> Burkitt </PERSON>, a freelance photographer, took pictures as debris fell around him, including one shot of a steel beam twisted like taffy. `` I do n't know what made me do it,'' said <PERSON> Burkitt </PERSON>. `` I just did n't want to miss it. It sounded like thunder.'' A forklift had to be brought in to lift concrete and material off one man caught in the collapse. <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> <PERSON> Coldicutt </PERSON>, who had been working in the store's deli section, said he moved quickly when the evacuation call came over the loudspeakers. `` Then the ceiling came down,'' he said. `` I turned around and looked at the deli section where I had been working and there were dozens of cars parked in it.'' <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Chard </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Station </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Square </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Developments </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Vancouver </LOCATION>, which has completed half of the planned $ 75 million Metrotown complex, said the company also will investigate the collapse. The contractor, <ORGANIZATION> Amako </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Construction </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, issued a statement saying it welcomed an investigation and was certain <PERSON> Amako </PERSON> would be cleared of any blame.

<TEXT>
 Sexual harassment of women in the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> remains a problem that can be remedied by emphasizing that the practice will not be tolerated, according to a <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> report released Sunday. The Task Force on Women in the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> said existing directives and the corps' primary grievance system are `` appropriate tools to implement <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> policy on this issue.'' However, the commandant of the corps must convey that sexual harassment will not be tolerated in the service, according to the executive summary of the final report. `` The -LRB- commandant -RRB- will improve sexual harassment awareness training in formal schools and at the recruit depots,'' said the report, which will be released Monday. The task force, formed in September 1987 at the request of then-Secretary of <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Webb </PERSON>, said the corps did not have a `` significant problem'' with fraternization. `` Fraternization is not a gender-specific issue,'' the report said. `` No corrective action was recommended.'' In February, <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> responded to a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> report by ordering expanded job opportunities for women in the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>, including the assignment of female Marines to embassy guard duty. Women account for about 10 percent of the nation's 2.1 million military personnel. By law, they are excluded from combat. The content of the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> report provided the basis of the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> report released Sunday. The report also recommended certain steps to improve the quality of life for female Marines, including solving the problem of shortage in uniform items and lengthy delays in filling special orders, ensuring full investigation when homosexual conduct is suspected and allowing a pregnant Marine to request a 30-day delay in the notification of her commander by the medical officer. The task force also recommended that the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> surgeon general review the policy regarding the assignment of obstetricians and gynecologists to combat service units, and the commandant review the number of women medical and dental personnel assigned to various units. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> surgeon general also should publish information regarding oral contraceptives for men, recreational programs should be expanded and additional child care centers be built, the report said. The commandant approved all the recommendations with the exception of pregnancy notification and oral contraceptives for men.

 Eleven of 27 police officers taken hostage by separatists in this French territory in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> were freed Monday following elections for the French presidency and local legislature. Four policemen were killed and at least 11 people were wounded in election violence that began Friday as pro-independence Melanesians tried to disrupt Sunday's balloting. French Defense Minister <PERSON> Andre </PERSON> <PERSON> Giraud </PERSON> announced in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> that 11 of the 27 gendarmes taken hostage Friday on the island of <LOCATION> Ouvea </LOCATION> were freed at dawn Monday. He provided no details. Three policemen were killed during the fighting at <LOCATION> Ouvea </LOCATION> and one wounded officer died Sunday. Three civilians were wounded in the <LOCATION> Ouvea </LOCATION> clash and on Sunday eight policemen were injured in three separate attacks. The French news agency Agence France-Presse quoted sources in <LOCATION> Noumea </LOCATION> as saying the 11 officers were freed because of `` pressure from tribal chiefs,'' <LOCATION> Ouvea </LOCATION> is 90 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Noumea </LOCATION>, the capital. Authorities closed 38 of the 139 polling stations because of gunfire and explosions during the elections in which voters cast ballots for both the French presidency and the New Caledonian legislature. Officials said the voter turnout was 56.3 percent, with militant separatists boycotting the balloting. <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s conservative Premier <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> scored an overwhelming victory in the New Caldenonian balloting for the presidency, taking nearly 74.6 percent of the vote. In mainland <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> was second among nine candidates, winning about 20 percent of the vote. Socialist President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> won the French elections with about 35 percent of the ballots and he and <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> will be in the May 8 runoff election. Polls in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Caledonia </LOCATION> closed Sunday just as those in most of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> were opening. In voting for the 48 legislative seats, the pro-French Rally for the Republic in <LOCATION> Caledonia </LOCATION> won 35. It is the territorial branch of <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON>'s Rally for the Republic party. The extreme-right <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> won eight seats, two conservative parties won three and dissident separatists two. Opposing the election `` was a first step, not an objective. Now we're going to launch a second phase and maybe a third phase,'' said <PERSON> Leopold </PERSON> <PERSON> Joredie </PERSON>, the `` security minister'' for <PERSON> Kanaky </PERSON>, the Kanak's self-proclaimed government. `` There are people here who are ready to fight to the end,'' he said in a telephone interview. Native Melanesians are known as Kanaks and make up 43 percent of the island group's population of 145,000. About 36 percent of the residents are of European background while most of the others are Asian or Tahitians. Many Kanaks seek independence, but a majority of the other citizens want <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Caledonia </LOCATION> to remain part of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. It was the third time in less than four years that <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Caledonians </LOCATION> have voted for representatives to new regional institutions. The latest territorial assembly was created by <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON>'s government over the objections of separatists French Minister for Overseas Territories <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Pons </PERSON> arrived in <LOCATION> Noumea </LOCATION> early Monday. <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> sent <PERSON> Pons </PERSON> to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Caledonia </LOCATION> after militant Melanesians killed three police officers and seized 27 hostages in the <LOCATION> Ouvea </LOCATION> attack. A fourth officer, shot in the back of the head, died Sunday in a <LOCATION> Sydney </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, hospital. Three Melanesians were wounded in the fighting. The kidnappers demanded the regional elections be canceled and that police reinforcements be removed from the island. They also demanded that negotiators be sent from <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> to discuss independence for the island. Violence flared again during the voting Sunday. One officer was shot in the abdomen while guarding a polling station in <LOCATION> Canala </LOCATION>, on the island's east coast. He was listed in serious condition at a hospital in <LOCATION> Noumea </LOCATION>. Another officer was injured before polls opened in <LOCATION> Pouembout </LOCATION>, on the main island's west coast 260 miles north of <LOCATION> Noumea </LOCATION>. Police in <LOCATION> Noumea </LOCATION> said separatists erected barricades in several villages, including one outside <LOCATION> Canala </LOCATION> where six gendarmes were injured Sunday afternoon. A spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gendarmerie </ORGANIZATION> said the six officers were wounded by `` thrown explosives'' and were taken to a hospital in <LOCATION> Noumea </LOCATION>, where one was in serious condition. In other parts of the archipelego, ballots were burned and telephone lines were cut. Police used tear gas to disperse crowds of protesters. A unit of 180 police reinforcements arrived in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Caledonia </LOCATION> Sunday morning.

 Seven girls struck by lightning as they huddled under a tree at a softball field remained hospitalized Sunday, four in serious condition, officials said. Eight members of a girl's softball team and their assistant coach were injured Saturday during the downpour shortly before a game at an elementary school near here. `` There was this huge snap, fire ball and all the girls were thrown on the ground,'' said <PERSON> Carrie </PERSON> <PERSON> Leach </PERSON>, whose 8-year-old daughter <PERSON> Katie </PERSON> was hurt. `` It was just awful.

<TEXT>
 Leftist guerrillas stormed a highland farming hamlet, held a mock trial and killed 20 peasants to avenge the slayings of three rebels, police said Sunday. In <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>, two policemen were shot and killed Saturday as they walked their beat in a working class neighborhood, according to officials. Police blamed both attacks on members of the <ORGANIZATION> Maoist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shining </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Path </ORGANIZATION> movement, which has been fighting for eight years to topple the government. About 30 guerrillas attacked the farming community of <LOCATION> Aranhuay </LOCATION> on Wednesday and ordered some 200 people to attend a `` trial'' in the village square, police reported. They said gunmen, wearing Peruvian army uniforms, pulled 20 men from the crowd and shot them after accusing them of being members of a self-defense patrol. Aranhuay is 30 miles north of <LOCATION> Ayacucho </LOCATION>, which is 230 miles southeast of <LOCATION> Lima </LOCATION>. Police said the account of the massacre came from peasants who fled to <LOCATION> Ayacucho </LOCATION> seeking protection. They said the refugees told them the guerrillas were seeking to avenge the deaths of three Shining Path members killed when the Aranhuay peasant patrol aided army troops in a clash with rebels in February. The Shining Path has killed hundreds of members of self-defense patrols since the units were organized by the military in 1984. Civil rights groups and opposition politicians have accused the military of abandoning the patrols, which are frequently armed only with pitchforks and knives. The government says more than 10,000 people, including nearly 600 policemen, have been killed in violence related to the Shining Path insurgency.

Making a strong showing in the field of nine candidates was <PERSON> Jean-Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Pen </PERSON>, 59, leader of the extreme right <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, with 14.5 percent. <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Pen </PERSON> campaigned on a tough anti-immigration platform. The big loser was <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> candidate <PERSON> Andre </PERSON> <PERSON> Lajoinie </PERSON>, whose 6.8 percent showing was the lowest in the history of the party that has been on a steady decline since 1981. Turnout in the election was estimated at 82 percent, compared to 81 percent in the first round of the 1981 elections. The 71-year-old <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>, whose popularity sank to unprecedented lows at mid-term only to soar in the last two years, in two weeks will face the hard-driving premier who has run the government since conservatives won the 1986 legislative elections. `` Now, the choice is simple,'' <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> said in a brief statement. `` To all of you who serve <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, we have before us great tasks. Frenchwomen and Frenchmen, let us rally together, neglecting no effort to win May 8.'' <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON>, in a joint appearance with <PERSON> Barre </PERSON> at the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> building, called on unity among conservatives to unseat <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>. `` Now, against the <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> candidate, we must rally together,'' he said. <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> organizers were jubilant as the returns rolled in. `` By placing <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> well in front in the first round, the voters have shown the direction for rallying the country on May 8,'' said <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Beregovoy </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>'s campaign manager. `` Mr. <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> is far behind,'' said <PERSON> Beregovoy </PERSON>. `` His policy has left many people unhappy and disappointed.'' The final polls a week ago had showed <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> defeating <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> by a comfortable margin in the second round. The president is the chief of state. The premier, elected by the legislature, is the head of government. Sunday's vote marked the first time a president and premier have opposed one another in a presidential election. The French have called the unusual governing arrangement `` cohabitation.'' The polling was something of a test for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, which has emerged as a major political factor in the past four years. <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Pen </PERSON> was hoping to solidify the gains of his party and its anti-immigrant and law-and-order stands. <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Pen </PERSON>, who said he would announce his stand on the runoff during a political rally on May 1, was elated with his tally Sunday. `` We have the certainty of a political earthquake and a radical transformation of the national landscape,'' he said. `` Nothing will ever be done in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> without the voters of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>.'' Otherwise, the campaign had contained little real political debate. The absence of major differences on the main issues turned the election into a contest of personalities. Unlike 1981, when voters faced a clear right-left choice between <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> and <PERSON> Valery </PERSON> <PERSON> Giscard </PERSON> d'Estaing, this election was more subtle. <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> abandoned revolutionary rhetoric of earlier years for mainstream themes in an effort to broaden appeal. <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> also pledged to open his government to a wider range of ideas. The two first-round leaders now have two more weeks to convince the voters. <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> will be seeking Communist and other extreme left votes, as well as nibbling at the center. <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> will be fighting for his share of the center and the extreme right. Rounding out the nine-candidate field was <PERSON> Antoine </PERSON> <PERSON> Waechter </PERSON>, 39, an ecologist, with 3.8 percent; <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Juquin </PERSON>, 58, leader of a splinter <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> reformist group, 2.1 percent; <ORGANIZATION> Arlette </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laguiller </ORGANIZATION>, 48, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Trotskyist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Worker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Struggle </ORGANIZATION> movement, 2 percent, and <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Boussel </PERSON>, 67, leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> a </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION>, 0.4 percent.

 Minority students occupying the dean's office at <ORGANIZATION> Williams </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in a push for changes in curriculum and recruiting reported progress toward ending the standoff after meeting with administrators Sunday. President <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Fix </PERSON> and Provost <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Grabois </PERSON> met for two hours with about 15 students in a building adjacent to <ORGANIZATION> Jenness </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, where the sit-in began Friday morning. The office was held Saturday by about 30 students. `` They're responsive to us,'' said one of the student negotiators, <PERSON> Monique </PERSON> <PERSON> Waddell </PERSON>, 19, a sophomore from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. `` The meeting is showing some progress.'' School spokesman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Kolesar </PERSON> called the discussions `` constructive.'' The two sides discussed the first three of the students' 13 demands: full scholarships for low-income minority students from urban areas, a campus cultural center for minorities and a special assistant to the president to recruit more minority teachers. The two sides met again in the evening and planned to reconvene Sunday night. Minorities account for 13 percent of the 2,000-member student body and about 10 percent of the 278-member faculty. The protesters also have demanded more of a minority perspective in the curriculum. During the negotiations, a young white man was seen taping a sign saying `` Quality, Not Quotas'' on a window at <PERSON> Jenness </PERSON>, with the words facing inside the building. Freshman <PERSON> Jillian </PERSON> <PERSON> Charles </PERSON>, one of about 10 students who spent Saturday night inside the <ORGANIZATION> Jenness </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, said she heard rocks being thrown at the building. About 20 students joined the sit-in during the day. The protest occurred during Parents' Weekend, and although some parents expressed concern about or support for the protest, they were largely undisturbed by it, said <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Berek </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the schoo. <ORGANIZATION> Jenness </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> is tucked to one side of the campus.

 <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Jean-Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Pen </PERSON> staked his claim to <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s future after his far-right views attracted thousands of voters in Sunday's first round of the presidential election. <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Pen </PERSON> drew 14.5 percent of the vote with 98 percent of the ballots counted and led all nine candidates in <LOCATION> Marseille </LOCATION>, his southern stronghold and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s third-largest city. <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Pen </PERSON> said his followers could decide the outcome of the May 8 runoff between Socialist President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>, who finished first in Sunday's balloting, and conservative Premier <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON>, the runnerup. `` Nothing will ever again be done in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> without the voters of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Pen </PERSON> said on national television. `` We have the certainty of a political earthquake and a radical transformation of the national landscape.'' Running on an anti-immigration platform that asked voters to choose between a `` French <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'' and a `` Third World <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Pen </PERSON> ran better than polls had predicted, making the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> the strongest extreme-right party in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. He said he would announce the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>'s voting strategy on May 1 during a demonstration to honor <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> of Arc. <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Pen </PERSON>, 59, who announced his candidacy a year ago, portrayed himself as an outsider with a chance to finish among the top two candidates in the election's first round. But throughout the campaign he emphasized his potential to sway the outcome of the final round. His campaign against immigration forced other candidates to address the delicate issue, sometimes at their expense. Officials of <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON>'s Rally for the Republic party have been conferring with the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> in search of an accord for the second round, according to French press reports. National Front Secretary-General <PERSON> Jean-Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Stirbois </PERSON> said his party will be `` very attentive'' to what <PERSON> Chirac </PERSON> has to propose on immigration and the death penalty. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> wants the death penalty restored. <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Pen </PERSON> has said he would not be willing to accept a ministerial post, saying only the presidency or the premiership `` will show the French that things have truly changed.'' `` If the vote confirms the tendency indicated by the polls, in the future it will be difficult to speak of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> as an ephemeral extreme right current,'' <ORGANIZATION> Le </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monde </ORGANIZATION> newspaper wrote in its Saturday edition. <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Pen </PERSON>, a white-haired <PERSON> Breton </PERSON> and former paratrooper, founded the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> in 1974. But the group remained on the political fringe for years. It entered national legislative elections in 1986 and now holds 33 of the 577 National Assembly seats.

 A student of street culture says gang members rounded up in police sweeps against gang violence probably consider their arrests a badge of honor. Police have arrested about 4,000 people in sweeps between Feb. 26 and Thursday, of which about 2,000 have been identified as gang members or associates, police spokesman Cmdr. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Booth </PERSON> said Sunday. Gang members caught in a sweep probably will brag about the experience and make being caught `` a way of getting esteem and prestige,'' said <PERSON> Diego </PERSON> <PERSON> Vigil </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> anthropologist and author of the book `` Barrio Gangs: Street Life and Identity in <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>.'' In a recent interview, <PERSON> Vigil </PERSON> said gang members `` wind up looking on it -LRB- an arrest -RRB- as an adventure. It gives them something to talk about when they get out.'' Assistant Police Chief <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON>, who is supervising the sweeps, strongly disagreed. `` If a ` gangbanger' knows that every time he identifies himself as a gang member he's going to do three or four days in jail, he stops being overt about it. He does n't want to go to jail every weekend. He wants to party and have fun,'' <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> said. Statistics support the effectiveness of the sweeps, <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> said. `` The sweeps began in late February. In March of this year we had 16 killings, and in March of the prior year there were 26,'' he said. Some observers expressed concern that the crackdown violates civil rights. Attorney <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Paz </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Hispanic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advisory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> to </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> and a <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> board member, said the dragnets, which target people wearing gang colors or other identifying clothing, remind him of the `` zoot suit'' roundups of the 1940s in which Hispanics were arrested largely because their clothing set them apart from others. `` People are willing to say, ` Let them stop all the kids.' That's my real concern,'' <PERSON> Paz </PERSON> said. `` That could be my kid.'' But <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> said that some gang violence is caused by gang members' clothing. `` In drive-by shootings, quite often the person they kill they've never seen before. They shoot at the colors,'' <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> said. `` They just say, ` There's one of them. Get him!'''

 `` Emily'' begins with an unctious <PERSON> Jason </PERSON> toasting his date, <PERSON> Emily </PERSON>. They have known each other a week. She proposes marriage and he scrams _ fast. In the first of many asides, <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Banes </PERSON> as <PERSON> Emily </PERSON> enthusiastically explains that that is the way she gets out of relationships without hurting anybody. `` Emily'' opened Sunday at the off-Broadway <ORGANIZATION> Manhattan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Theater </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>. Author <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Metcalfe </PERSON>, an associate artist at the Old Globe Theater in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>, has taken a look at the romantic problems of a liberated, single young woman in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Banes </PERSON> is a sensitive yet vigorous actress who was last seen in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> in `` On the Verge,'' a play about self-sufficient women of the 19th century. She makes the inconsistent, sometimes strong-headed and unkind <PERSON> Emily </PERSON> seem adorable. <PERSON> Emily </PERSON>, who earns big money on Wall Street, is very interested in men and sex but never in love before. She falls for <PERSON> Jon </PERSON>, a waiter and out-of-work actor, a handsome blond from <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Emily </PERSON>'s four Wall Street colleagues are ever giving her advice _ contradictory, cynical or silly. In the play's funniest scene, she climbs into the audience, from which she interrupts <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> in his acting class. <PERSON> Emily </PERSON> wins <PERSON> Jon </PERSON>. But their apparent growing commitment scares her, so she proposes. He accepts. But it is not happy ending time for this liberated young woman. <PERSON> Melcalfe </PERSON> makes clear that it is not a difference in salaries that comes between them or <PERSON> Emily </PERSON>'s career ambitions. And he makes <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> almost miraculously salt-of-the-earth Midwestern, feet on the ground while able to put his love into romantic words. He drops only hints of <PERSON> Emily </PERSON>'s problem but spells it out at the end. Her parents divorced when she was 3, and she never learned self-esteem or how to love or how to tell somebody her deepest feelings. The well-chosen cast of 10 is directed in lively fashion by <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Gutierrez </PERSON>. Sets around <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>, mostly of back-wall projections, are by <PERSON> Heidi </PERSON> <PERSON> Landesman </PERSON>. But, due to author <PERSON> Metcalfe </PERSON> and <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Banes </PERSON>, at the end of the play one does not dismiss it as about just another poor little yuppie girl but instead sighs, `` Poor Emily.''

 The army lifted a four-day ban Sunday to let Palestinians travel from the occupied territories into <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, but <PERSON> Arabs </PERSON> said soldiers wrecked homes and shops in another bid to control unrest. Israeli solders have killed 173 Palestinian protesters in the nearly five-month-old uprising against 21 years of <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>, according to <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> figures. An <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldier and civilian also have been killed. Defense Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> told the Cabinet that 165 Palestinians have died in the uprising, including 147 killed by soldiers, <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> said Sunday. <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON> said 4,900 Palestinians have been detained since Dec. 8, including 1,700 held in administrative detention for up to six months without trial. Police ordered Arab merchants in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> to open their stores at normal hours in a tug-of-war with protest leaders, who are also trying to dictate when shops may do business. `` I am afraid for my life,'' 43-year-old <PERSON> Saleh </PERSON> <PERSON> Sagari </PERSON> said, explaining why he opened his tiny grocery shop at hours dictated by the uprising's leaders. `` If I open -LRB- during army-ordered hours -RRB-, they will burn me down.'' Police in riot gear delivered the new orders to shopkeepers along the Street of the Prophets just outside the walled <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. Officers on horses kept back curious tourists and passers-by. Shopkeepers could be jailed for two years if they defy the army's instructions, said police spokesman <PERSON> Rafi </PERSON> <PERSON> Levy </PERSON>. In the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> village of <LOCATION> Bet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Roch </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Hebron </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> witnesses said <PERSON> Ahmad </PERSON> <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> <PERSON> Salim </PERSON> <PERSON> Amar </PERSON>, 23, was killed Saturday when he defied the army order to halt. The army said it was investigating. The army had reported Saturday that another Palestinian was killed during a protest in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> village of <LOCATION> Qabatiya </LOCATION>. Meanwhile, the socialist <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minister </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shimon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peres </ORGANIZATION> adopted on Sunday its platform for the November elections and said it would submit any agreement for a <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace to <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> voters, according to party spokeswoman <PERSON> Michal </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>. The platform also called for Jewish settlements to remain in the occupied lands. But it said parts of the occupied territories with a high percentage of <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> residents may be returned to Jordanian-Palestinian control. In addition to lifting the four-day ban Sunday, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> also permitted deliveries of gasoline to the occupied areas for the first time in more than a month. It ended a six-day curfew in more than a dozen towns and refugee camps, also helping thousands of <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> workers reach jobs in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, an army spokesman said. But curfews were extended a seventh day on three towns on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and a refugee camp in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>. The spokesman said the curfew in the Boureij refugee camp was intended to allow soldiers to destroy buildings which were put up without permits. Arab reports said the army destroyed eight houses and four shops and took down stone barricades protesters had erected on roads. The army spokesman would not say what buildings were torn down. An <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> photographer saw a garage, part of a gas station on the outskirts of <LOCATION> Buoreij </LOCATION>, reduced to rubble. The owner said he did n't know why his property was razed. The army has destroyed Arab shops and homes during the uprising in an effort to make life difficult for organizers of the protests on land that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> seized in the 1967 Middle East War. In Arab east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, about 30 police, some in riot helmets and carrying clubs and automatic rifles, issued orders to shopkeepers opposite <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION> Gate to stop following instructions of uprising leaders to open their shops only in the late afternoon. Police had ordered about 25 merchants on the street to open all day Sunday, but merchants defied the order and threw open their doors only at the hours set by the underground leaders. Police spokesman <PERSON> Levy </PERSON> said police orders issued Sunday said that stores must be closed from late afternoon through early evening beginning Monday. Several shopkeepers said they were confused by the conflicting orders and uncertain about what to do. `` We do n't want to open. We do n't know what we want to do,'' said <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Aldi </PERSON>, 25, who runs a coffee shop. <ORGANIZATION> Aldi </ORGANIZATION> said he did not know who was issuing the uprising orders. `` They call you on the telephone and tell you what to do. You do n't know who called,'' he said Also Sunday, a military court gave an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldier, <PERSON> Saguy </PERSON> <PERSON> Harpaz </PERSON>, a suspended prison term of five months for taking part in beating two Arab protesters. <PERSON> Saguy </PERSON> was also reduced in rank from private first class to private. The Feb. 25 incident was filmed by <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> television and showed four soldiers, including <PERSON> Harpaz </PERSON>, beat the Arabs with rocks and rifle butts for more than half an hour.

 The Communist Party of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> reorganized Sunday after dissolving last year in a disagreement over the direction it should take. Delegates from throughout <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> agreed at a congress Sunday that the newly formed party should operate under the rules that existed before the party's moderate wing won control in 1985. In 1985, the moderate faction won all 45 seats on the executive committee, routing the pro-Moscow faction and the party collapsed. The 150 delegates to Sunday's congress elected an executive committee of 39, which plans to hold its first meeting May 7. Card-carrying membership in the party was 10,350 in November 1987. Founded in 1920, the party had 50,000 members in 1945 but it has declined steadily and has not had a member in Parliament for 38 years.

 Toxic gas leaked from a chemical plant Sunday, forcing an estimated 1,800 people in two states from their homes, officials said. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, chief of the <LOCATION> McCaysville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, said some people reported nausea, burning eyes and itchy throats. However, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Francis </PERSON>, operations director of the <ORGANIZATION> Tennessee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said he had no reports of anyone being hospitalized. A pressure release valve came off a tank at the <ORGANIZATION> Tennessee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> about 2 p.m., releasing a cloud of sulfur trioxide, said <PERSON> Francis </PERSON>. The leak was stopped about 4:40 p.m. <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> said that tests at the <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> borders at about 10 p.m. showed no traces of the chemical. He said said he expected the evacuation order to be lifted later Sunday night. Sulfur trioxide is irritating to the skin, eyes and throat and can cause choking, coughing and severe discomfort, <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Copperhill </LOCATION> is in upper east <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> just across the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> borders. Up to 1,000 people were evacuated from <LOCATION> McCaysville </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> said about 600 people were evacuated in <LOCATION> Copperhill </LOCATION>, 150 in <LOCATION> Newtown </LOCATION> and 50 in <LOCATION> Coletown </LOCATION>. Officials at the chemical plant could not immediately be reached for comment, but <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> said they were meeting with both <ORGANIZATION> TEMA </ORGANIZATION> officials and officials from the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>GM Dropping Firestone As Major Tire Supplier</HEAD>

 <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> is dropping <ORGANIZATION> Firestone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Rubber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> as a supplier of tires for new <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> cars and trucks, which account for about 20 percent of Firestone's <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> production, the companies said Sunday. The unexpected setback comes as <ORGANIZATION> Firestone </ORGANIZATION> shareholders prepare to vote Monday on a $ 2.6 billion buyout offer from <ORGANIZATION> Bridgestone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, although <ORGANIZATION> Firestone </ORGANIZATION> said the <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> move would not affect the merger plans. <PERSON> Firestone </PERSON> stated that it learned of <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s planned phaseout on Friday. There was no immediate comment from <ORGANIZATION> Bridgestone </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nevin </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive of <ORGANIZATION> Firestone </ORGANIZATION>, said in a news release he was `` surprised and disappointed'' by <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s move, but said <PERSON> Firestone </PERSON> was confident it would find other markets for its tires without hurting profits <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> plans to reduce <PERSON> Firestone </PERSON>'s role as a supplier significantly during the second half of this year, and will eliminate the tiremaker from its supply base over a period of up to two years, <PERSON> Firestone </PERSON> stated. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Crellin </PERSON> said in a telephone interview in <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> that the move was part of the automaker's `` ongoing supplier-rationalization study'' _ a periodic review of suppliers' capacity and future needs _ and indicated it was not linked to the impending buyout by <ORGANIZATION> Bridgestone </ORGANIZATION> `` We've got four other tire suppliers: General Tire, <ORGANIZATION> Goodyear </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Michelin </ORGANIZATION> and Uniroyal-Goodrich,'' <PERSON> Crellin </PERSON> said. `` There are no plans to look for another supplier at this time. We will be informing the other four tire suppliers of the availability of increased business.'' <PERSON> Crellin </PERSON> declined to say how long the phaseout would take and that it was <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s policy not to discuss the amount of business it does with any suppliers. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s biggest tire supplier is Uniroyal-Goodrich, which supplies about 34 percent of its tires, according to estimates by the trade publication Modern Tire Dealer. <ORGANIZATION> Goodyear </ORGANIZATION> is second at 22.5 percent, <ORGANIZATION> Firestone </ORGANIZATION> is third with 20 percent, General Tire was fourth at 17.5 percent and <ORGANIZATION> Michelin </ORGANIZATION> was fifth at 4.5 percent, according to the publication. Chicago-based Firestone is the nation's second-largest tiremaker after <ORGANIZATION> Goodyear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Rubber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, with tires accounting for nearly 70 percent of its $ 4.2 billion in annual sales. <PERSON> Firestone </PERSON> said it has told <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s move and was authorized to say in its news release that <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> has no plans to change its relationship with Firestone, its fourth-largest tire supplier.

<HEAD>Weak Dollar Lures European Tourists To South Florida</HEAD>

 European tourists are flocking to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> this year, lured not only by sun, beaches and attractions such as Disney World but also by a weak dollar that has cut the cost of such getaways. `` Last time I came, the dollar was really high and we lost a lot of money,'' said <PERSON> Gabriella </PERSON> <PERSON> Heurlin </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>, comparing her family's 1984 trip to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> with their April visit to <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. `` You were always checking money and saying, ` My God, how expensive.' But not this time. Now, you just buy.'' `` Loads of shopping! We bought hundreds of T-shirts,'' said <PERSON> Brigitte </PERSON> <PERSON> Haskins </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Surrey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, as she toted stuffed shopping bags through <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> to catch a plane home. Local resort association executives say that 20,000 brochures sent to their <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> tourism office to tout package trips to <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> were gone in 10 days. `` The requests coming in are phenomenal,'' said <PERSON> Murray </PERSON> <PERSON> Gold </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beach </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hotel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. `` We never expected it.'' Since the dollar started sinking in February 1985, increasing the buying power of foreign currencies, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has become increasingly attractive as a vacation spot for foreign tourists. In March, the dollar fell to its lowest monthly average since November 1978 on the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>'s trade-weighted index of 18 major currencies. The state does not track foreign tourism, but <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Schultz </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> said the bank estimated <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s foreign tourism increased by between 25 and 30 percent last year over 1986. In the first 11 months of 1987, 34.1 million people vacationed in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Chip </PERSON> <PERSON> Coggins </PERSON> of the state division of tourism, up from 33.7 million in all of 1986. December 1987 figures were not available. Tourism officials here note that although foreign tourists often travel to attractions like <ORGANIZATION> Disney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Daytona </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> that are further north, the <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> area _ a key arrival point for international travel _ is regarded as a primary destination. Of the 6.79 million tourists in <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> last year, 418,000 were European visitors, a 36.6 percent increase over foreign tourism in 1986, said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Greater </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Visitors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>. `` The falling dollar is a major factor,'' <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said. Tourism pumped $ 4.9 billion to the county economy last year, and occupancy rates totaled 71.5 percent for <ORGANIZATION> Dade </ORGANIZATION>'s 56,990 hotel and motel beds. This year, officials expect a 5 percent to 7 percent rise in tourism, said <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>. In neighboring <LOCATION> Broward </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, hoteliers saw a slight increase over last year, especially among British and West German tourists, although specific numbers were not available, said <PERSON> Broward </PERSON> tourism bureau statistician <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Laster </PERSON>. In <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, local tourism officials hope the dollar's decline will be their summertime salvation. `` <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> has turned a circle and become a hot resort again,'' said <PERSON> Gold </PERSON>, whose group represents about 150 motels and hotels. `` For years, we were down in the dumps.'' Gold's association last year opened an office on <LOCATION> Buckingham </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palace </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Road </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to sell one-week packages with prices starting at $ 160, including hotel, a rental car, a one-day cruise and jai-alai tickets. The packages aim to pull in <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kingdom </LOCATION> tourists during the slow season of April 10 to Dec. 15, when blistering daytime heat and steamy nights drive off winter tourists. Some <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> tourist attractions also are noticing more foreign accents lately. `` I'm hearing French, German and Japanese everywhere,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Finley </PERSON>, superintendent of the 1.4 million-acre Everglades National Park. He said he expects Europeans to account for about 80 percent of summer business at the park's <ORGANIZATION> Flamingo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lodge </ORGANIZATION>.

 The protracted labor strife at <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> has given way to a publicity battle that the company portrays as a counter-attack to a well-orchestrated union campaign of negative publicity. <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> and its <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> unit have been blaming agitation by labor leaders at <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> for recent critical scrutiny and investigations by lawmakers, the news media and political candidates. `` It has been a very well-orchestrated campaign, and with the political environment and the pressure on the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- over increased passenger complaints and safety concerns industrywide -RRB-, we were a perfect target,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Ceremsak </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. Houston-based <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> has responded with ads in national newspapers, news conferences, special mailings to travel agents and an unusually high profile by chairman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>. The negative publicity may have peaked earlier this month with the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>'s announcement of an unprecedented investigation of <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>'s finances and management, and a concurrent safety inspections of its Eastern and <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> fleets. The company apparently was stunned by the wide publicity given the union leadership's long-time claims that <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> was out to bust the unions, cannibalize <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s assets, and pressure employees into ignoring safety problems. `` In some cases, the unions' issues and allegations just made good copy,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Hicks </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. `` And you've certainly got a very political year.'' Democratic presidental candidates <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> and <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> all have spoken out against <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> management, which also has been the topic of critical congressional hearings. Eastern pilots last year launched a `` MaxSafety'' campaign, in which pilots sent anonymous postcards detailing safety problems to the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION>. Eastern's machinists and flight attendants unions also repeatedly have alleged that <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> management has been reducing safety measures taken by the company. Their claims and examples have been the subject of national magazine, newspaper and television network news stories on Eastern safety and management. After the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> announcement, Eastern President <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakes </PERSON>, who in previous weeks had been declining interview requests, immediately held a news conference in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON>, who rarely talks to reporters, appeared on <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Meet The Press'' and then, joined by <PERSON> Bakes </PERSON>, former <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Borman </PERSON> and other officials, gave a packed news conference in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on April 18. The day after the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> announcement, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> took out full-page ads in most major markets saying it welcomed the inspection as a chance to disprove the charges about safety problems. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union president, said: `` We are absolutely being truthful.'' He said the federal inspection of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> has been `` a whitewash'' and that <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> employees have been intimidated against giving <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> inspectors proof of safety problems. <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> also has run full-page ads reprinting a favorable <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> editorial and detailing management's position that <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s unions must accept cuts _ Bakes wants to reduce labor costs by 30 percent _ to turn around its financial losses. <PERSON> Hicks </PERSON> did n't have figures on how much the company has spent on such publicity. Eastern's traffic dipped slightly in the first few days after the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> inspection began, but officials said there has been no major drop-off. <PERSON> Paula </PERSON> <PERSON> Musto </PERSON>, an Eastern marketing spokeswoman, said travel agents had been supportive but the company has taken additional steps to send out detailed information rebutting union allegations, including a special edition of its newsletter to travel agents. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, who runs a <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> travel agency, said: `` I think any travel agent who knows the business knows there's a lot of propaganda going on. I'm confident about <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s safety, and I do n't pay much attention to all the propaganda.''
