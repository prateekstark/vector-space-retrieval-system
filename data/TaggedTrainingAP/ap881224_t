 A jury ordered a psychiatrist to pay nearly $ 1.9 million to a female patient with whom he had sex numerous times over a 12-year period, billing her for each visit. The <ORGANIZATION> Multnomah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> jury deliberated for five hours Thursday before reaching its verdict against Dr. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Petroske </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>. The woman, a 55-year-old former elementary school teacher, was awarded $ 832,000 in general damages for pain and suffering, $ 1 million in punitive damages and $ 43,800 in lost wages. Testimony and evidence presented during the two-week trial indicated <PERSON> Petroske </PERSON> began treating the woman in 1967 and started having sexual relations with her in 1975. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Huegli </PERSON>, the woman's attorney, said <PERSON> Petroske </PERSON> ended the sexual relations in early 1987 while he was being investigated by the state <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Examiners </ORGANIZATION> about allegations that he was having sex with another patient. <PERSON> Petroske </PERSON> admitted he lied to the state board about the number of patients with whom he had sexual relations. In early July, the board suspended him from practice for 90 days, fined him $ 5,000 and placed him on probation for 10 years. <PERSON> Petroske </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hewitt </PERSON>, told jurors during closing arguments that her client is `` not going to be practicing medicine under any circumstances after this case is over.'' <PERSON> Hewitt </PERSON> admitted <PERSON> Petroske </PERSON> had inflicted physical damage on the patient, but she contended it was not permanent. <PERSON> Huegli </PERSON>, however, said other doctors thought the woman suffered permanent brain damage from what he called a `` long, insidious, poisoning regimen'' of drugs prescribed by <PERSON> Petroske </PERSON>. <PERSON> Huegli </PERSON> said <PERSON> Petroski </PERSON> billed the woman for all her visits, including the ones in which they engaged in sex.

 Two groups of feuding nuns at a monastery here will be separated by an iron gate as they celebrate the same Christmas Mass unreconciled after a 2 -LCB- - month standoff Five nuns who remain locked in the monastery's infirmary have said they will not rejoin eight other nuns until the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> answers their pleas to end the dispute over liberalizations of their order. `` They'll watch the midnight Mass from the where they are, through the bars,'' said Sister <PERSON> Eliane </PERSON>, a Carmelite who lives at the Most Blessed Virgin Mary of <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carmel </LOCATION> but is not among the 13 cloistered nuns. `` They'll all be doing the same thing, only they wo n't be doing them together.'' The five nuns will watch the Christmas midnight Mass through two small openings covered by an iron gate in the infirmary, which overlooks the darkened chapel of the monastery, Sister <PERSON> Eliane </PERSON> said this week. The rebel nuns locked themselves in the infirmary Oct. 4 to thwart what they say was their imminent eviction from the monastery. They said their mother superior, <PERSON> Prioress </PERSON> <PERSON> Mother </PERSON> <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON> <PERSON> Hewitt </PERSON>, wanted them kicked out for speaking against such liberalizations as the introduction of television and sweets to the monastery. <PERSON> Mother </PERSON> <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON> has said the dispute revolves around the barricaded nuns' unwillingness to follow her orders. <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> officials so far have declined comment. The standoff at first was marked by a bitter media campaign, with Sister <PERSON> John </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>, one of the protesting nuns, fielding reporters' questions by telephone, and <PERSON> Sister </PERSON> <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON> holding a news conference to lambaste the nuns' `` attempted anarchy.'' Both sides have been virtually silent since. Meanwhile, friends and family of the nuns are trying to make the holiday a little brighter. The infirmary is decorated with a 2-foot Christmas tree adorned with red ribbons, an Advent wreath and small felt banners plastered with biblical passages, Sister <PERSON> Eliane </PERSON> said. `` They're not down in the dumps or anything, but they're anxious to hear from <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>,'' she said of all the nuns who live at the monastery. `` It's obvious that it's not going to be settled before the holidays. We're just hoping it wo n't be too long after the new year.'' Christmas dinner also will be segregated. A man who caters a Christmas meal of fish for the monastery each year will carry on a tradition that was started by his late brother, a priest, Sister <PERSON> Eliane </PERSON> said. The donor, whom she would not identify, said he would provide dinner only if all the nuns share the food. They will, but they'll maintain their separate quarters, Sister <PERSON> Eliane </PERSON> said. `` Christmas is Christmas no matter what your problems are at the time,'' she said. `` We all plan on making the most of it.''

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> has begun focusing on long-term plans to help earthquake-stricken Soviet <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> rebuild its destroyed and damaged health care facilities. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schubert </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>, said the pipeline of emergency aid supplies is full and flowing well, and no further immediate aid is needed at this time. Priority attention is being given to the construction of a new general hospital, he told a news conference Friday. The earthquake destroyed the only one, killing all doctors and staff inside the building. In a related development, the office of President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said his son and grandson are flying to <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> over the Christmas weekend to deliver toys and medical supplies to earthquake victims. <PERSON> Jeb </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, 35, a <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> real estate developer, and his son, <PERSON> George </PERSON>, 12, will spend about six hours in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>, the Armenian capital, on Christmas Day. The Bushes are traveling to <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> as volunteers for <ORGANIZATION> Americares </ORGANIZATION>, a private relief agency that has chartered a DC-8 cargo plane to transport supplies to the region when 55,000 people were killed in the earthquake and about 500,000 were left homeless. <PERSON> Schubert </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> has received $ 3.5 million in cash contributions and pledges for <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> disaster relief and that more money is coming in `` every hour.'' He said the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> will use the funds to help replace health and medical facilities that were destroyed by the Dec. 7 earthquake. The <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> will be prepared to help fill any gaps that appear at the request of the Soviet <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>, he said. <PERSON> Schubert </PERSON> said priority long-term needs in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> include: _ The building of a general hospital to replace one that was totally destroyed in the quake _ The creation of a facility to make and install artificial limbs _ The establishment of a permanent tracking center to trace families of earthquake victims _ A disaster preparedness program to reduce deaths and injuries in the event of another earthquake in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> _ The rebuilding and expansion of a destroyed school for handicapped children <PERSON> Schubert </PERSON>, who returned Thursday from an inspection tour of the disaster areas in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>, said 27,000 railroad cars of relief supplies have arrived so far in addition to 148 planes carrying emergency equipment. He said Soviet officials have been conscientious in keeping track of the incoming supplies. They have promised to return expensive equipment to donors or to seek permission to use it elsewhere once it is no longer needed in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>, he said. There have been reports of confusion and inept rescue efforts at the disaster scene, but <PERSON> Schuster </PERSON> said he believes the work went well given the immensity of the destruction and the relative inexperience of Soviet officials in disaster relief. `` Given the size of the disaster, I think they responded well,'' he said. `` It's impossible to have a disaster site in which there is not confusion initially.'' In addition, he said, it should be noted that in the first day or so, `` all of the people present were affected; they all lost family members.'' `` The people displayed wonderful warmth and dignity,'' <PERSON> Schubert </PERSON> said. `` Time after time they expressed their thanks to the American public, particularly to thank those in the <LOCATION> American-Armenian </LOCATION> community,'' he said. `` When they stopped to thank us on the streets the profusion of gratitude made it difficult to hold back tears _ theirs and ours.'' <PERSON> Schubert </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> helped deal with the crisis effectively and offered all forms of cooperation to its American counterpart. `` Bad times bring good people together,'' <PERSON> Schubert </PERSON> said. In addition to the $ 3.5 million in cash and pledges, <PERSON> Schubert </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> has received more than $ 8 million worth of medical and other supplies and shipped them to <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>. These include kidney dialysis machines, blood collection bags, plaster dressings, needles and syringes, finger splints, bandages, antiseptics, sutures, cervical collars, antibiotics, orthopedic pins, ultrasound machines, plastic eating utensils, blankets and plastic sheeting.

<TEXT>
 Two of 17 lawsuits filed after the crash a <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> jetliner last year have been settled out of court, according to court documents filed by Friday's deadline. <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> Flight 1713 crashed on takeoff during a snowstorm Nov. 15, 1987, killing 28 of the 82 people on board, and injuring 54. The 15 remaining lawsuits are scheduled to go to trial beginning Jan. 9. Also Friday, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Sherman </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Finesilver </PERSON> denied motions from the airline for dismissal of punitive damage claims, rejecting <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>'s contention that various provisions of the Federal Aviation Act pre-empt traditional areas of state regulation. He also ruled that <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> law could be used to calculate damages, rather than <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> law which more severely limits such damages. <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>'s parent company, <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>, is based in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. Details of the two settlements disclosed Friday, both of which involved passengers who survived but were seriously injured, were not released. Initially, 36 lawsuits were filed but several have been settled out of court and several other new suits have been filed. Lawyers for Continental say <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> airport officials are responsible for allowing snow and slush to build on the runway and that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> allowed flights to continue throughout the snowstorm. <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> also contends that the crash occurred because of swirling winds created by a jumbo jet that landed shortly before Flight 1713 took off.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has authorized the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to begin a new round of subsidized wheat purchases from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Acting Undersecretary <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON> said Friday that <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> has been allocated 2 million metric tons of wheat under the department's Export Enhancement Program, or EEP, which allows designated foreign buyers to buy <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> commodities at cut-rate prices. The Soviets bought about 9 million tons of wheat under <ORGANIZATION> EEP </ORGANIZATION> arrangements during the 1987-88 year that ended Sept. 30 but so far has not ordered any for 1988-89 delivery. <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON> also said the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> will be allowed to buy up to 16 million tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> grain in the 1988-89 year. The limit under a recently extended agreement between the two countries was 12 million tons. Meanwhile, the department said <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> has bought more corn, which does not carry the <ORGANIZATION> EEP </ORGANIZATION> subsidies. Both wheat and corn are included in the agreement. The <ORGANIZATION> EEP </ORGANIZATION> arrangement allows <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> exporters to sell wheat and other designated commodities to specified countries at reduced prices in order to meet foreign competition. The exporters then collect free government surpluses of grain or other products as bonuses, or subsidies. Earlier this week, for example, <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> announced an <ORGANIZATION> EEP </ORGANIZATION> wheat sale to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> that carried a subsidy rate of $ 23.10 per ton, or about 63 cents per bushel. Officials also said Friday that the Soviets bought an additional 750,000 tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corn, bringing the total sold to 8.78 million tons in the agreement's sixth year, which began Oct. 1. Last year, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corn sales to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> totaled slightly less than 5.2 million tons. Wheat sales in 1987-88, all subsidized, totaled slightly more than 9 million tons. A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 39.4 bushels of corn or 36.7 bushels of wheat or soybeans. The 750,000 tons of corn would be about 29.5 million bushels. Corn prices have been averaging about $ 2.61 per bushel at the farm level, according to <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> estimates, meaning that the latest sale could have a farm value of around $ 77 million. Besides the corn and the likelihood of wheat for 1988-89 delivery under the pact, the Soviets have ordered 500,000 tons of soybeans and 532,500 tons of soybean meal, plus 500,000 tons of grain sorghum. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> on Nov. 28 signed an extension of the previous five-year grain agreement, which had expired on Sept. 30. The extension of the previous pact will run through Dec. 31, 1990.

<TEXT>
 Under pressure from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Farmers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> is easing some of the paperwork requirements for delinquent borrowers. But it says a 45-day deadline for responding to overdue notices wo n't change. A growing number of lawmakers have been urging the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> agency to extend the deadline, which gives farmers 45 days in which to respond after receiving official notices to begin settling overdue loan accounts. The notices were sent out last month to more than 80,000 delinquent borrowers who owe FmHA more than $ 8 billion. `` There's just no way legally we can stretch it -LRB- the deadline -RRB-,'' acting agency Administrator <PERSON> La </PERSON> <PERSON> Verne </PERSON> <PERSON> Ausman </PERSON> said Friday. `` We must hear from the farmer within that time.'' Several basic `` response'' forms must be completed and returned within 45 days as the minimum requirement. <PERSON> Ausman </PERSON> said that in order to ease paperwork requirements for late repayers, <ORGANIZATION> FmHA </ORGANIZATION> county offices will accept supporting documents for the applications after the 45-day deadline, but that such agreements must be worked out with those offices. The notices were sent out to FmHA borrowers who were at least 180 days delinquent in repaying loans. The notices informed them of loan servicing and restructuring options, and said failure to respond would trigger `` acceleration'' of loan collection, a step toward foreclosure or forced sale of assets. `` We have advised our field offices to use a test of reasonableness with borrowers who, through no fault of their own, are unable to complete all the forms on time,'' <PERSON> Ausman </PERSON> said. `` For example,'' he added, `` if because of illness or other circumstances beyond his or her control, a farmer could n't obtain all the information he or she needed, we wo n't be hard-nosed if they have given us completed response forms, and farm and home plans. But we will be looking for evidence of a good-faith effort on the part of the borrower to get all the forms in a timely manner.'' <PERSON> Ausman </PERSON> said that as a minimum, the documents that must be sent in within 45 days include: _ Form FmHA 410-1, Application for <ORGANIZATION> FmHA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> _ Form FmHA 431-2, Farm and Home Plan, including the balance sheet _ Attachment 2, Acknowledgement of Notice of Program Availability, or Attachment 4, Response to Notice Informing Me of <ORGANIZATION> FmHA </ORGANIZATION>'s Intent to Accelerate My Loan

 A scientific advisory panel says it has concerns about <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s efforts to continue improvements in the design of the space shuttle's booster rockets. <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Guyford </PERSON> <PERSON> Stever </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> panel, said Friday that although <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> has flown two successful missions since the 1986 Challenger accident, he has a `` broad concern'' that the space agency continue to monitor and evaluate the redesigned booster rockets. `` Success breeds confidence, and that's what you want, but it can also threaten you with complacency,'' <PERSON> Stever </PERSON> said in an interview. He added, `` I do n't see complacency developing, but I do know they have budget problems, and how they'll solve that is difficult to say.'' <PERSON> Stever </PERSON>'s panel, in its final report delivered to <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday, cited two new problems with the redesigned boosters used in the Sept. 29 launch of the shuttle Discovery: _ Small pieces of cork used to cover external diagnostic instruments and their electrical leads were lost during flight and one piece is believed to have damaged thermal tiles on the orbiter <PERSON> Cork </PERSON> is also suspected of causing extensive damage to tiles on Atlantis, which was launched Dec. 2. _ Metal-to-metal seals were scratched and pitted <PERSON> Stever </PERSON> said that removal of the seals could raise shuttle program costs, but he said the scars were small and did not threaten safety. The report also lists nine problem areas that need to be addressed before the redesign effort can be considered complete. Among the remaining tasks are strengthening of the conical base of the booster rocket, more testing of booster segments to determine their potential to be reused safely, improving materials for bonding booster parts, developing alternative materials for O-ring seals and more test-firing at cold temperatures, the report said. In the Challenger accident, one of the O-rings between the booster segments failed, allowing hot exhaust gases from the rocket to leak and cause the explosion that destroyed the shuttle and killed its crew of seven. Cold temperatures also contributed to the O-ring's failure. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> said it will `` carefully consider all the group's recommendations. <PERSON> Stever </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> officials have told him the agency has plans to carry out some of the tasks cited in the report, including a cold-weather test scheduled next month, and is considering the others on the list. The booster rockets worked for 24 flights before failing on the Challenger mission, <PERSON> Stever </PERSON> pointed out. Referring to the redesigned booster rockets, he said, `` we do n't consider it a bad design, it's just that things could be improved further. The report also recommends several risk-reduction steps, including maintaining technically competent personnel familiar with booster design to evaluate and improve quality control, assembly and launch operations and maintaining ground-testing and in-flight performance measuring programs. It also recommends insulating the budget for these safety activities from `` competitive pressures'' from other programs. The panel of independent scientists was set up at the request of the White House-appointed <ORGANIZATION> Rogers </ORGANIZATION> commission that investigated the Challenger accident. The commission asked the panel to monitor <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s compliance with its recommendations.

 Twenty-five journalists were slain around the world in 1988, seven fewer than in 1987, but other forms of violence and intimidation against news gatherers increased, according to a survey of press freedom. During the year, 225 journalists were arrested or detained in various countries and 24 expelled, <ORGANIZATION> Freedom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> said Friday in its annual survey. Fourteen were kidnapped or disappeared, 28 wounded, 90 beaten or otherwise assaulted, 43 were targets of death threats and 12 had their homes raided or destroyed, it said. It said 40 newspapers or radio stations in 12 countries were closed and that nine were bombed, burned or destroyed. Also, more than 200 instances of lesser harassment occurred. The anti-press actions occurred in 70 countries, compared with 57 countries the year before. `` The figures do not reflect other forms of official and unofficial editorial censorship, and diverse methods of economic and political pressuring of the mass media,'' said the survey report by <PERSON> Leonard </PERSON> <PERSON> Sussman </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Freedom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> senior scholar. `` The statistics are a clue, however, to those official actions which generate self-censorship by journalists.'' The figures for 1988 are as of Dec. 10. The world survey rated press conditions as `` most free'' in 57 countries, including most states of the Western alliance, and `` least free'' in 83, including the communist bloc and much of the Third World. Nineteen other countries were described as `` intermediary'' and included some of <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and scattered Third World nations. It said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kingdom </LOCATION>, whose press is in the most-free category, was slipping by using its Official Secrets Act to try to block publication of some stories. It said that such least-free nations as <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> had improved by displaying more openness while remaining centrally controlled. <ORGANIZATION> Freedom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> describes itself as a non-partisan national organization that monitors political and civil rights and tries to strengthen free societies.

 For 56 years, <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Sedat </PERSON> and <PERSON> Grace </PERSON> <PERSON> Dutton </PERSON> have been exchanging Christmas cards _ or rather one Christmas card, sent back and forth year after year. The greeting features a bagpipe-playing Scotsman with the verse: `` Hoot! for a Jolly Christmas! I'll send a card to wish ye a Christmas full of cheer. I'll send my name in pencil so ye'll use the card next year.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Sedat </PERSON> first sent the card to her friend in 1932. `` I thought it was funny,'' she said. `` So I did sign it in pencil along with the date, mailed it off to <PERSON> Grace </PERSON>, and forgot all about it.''

 Fuel oil from a leaking barge began washing ashore on resort beaches of the southwestern <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> coast Friday, and at least 50 birds were found with oil on their feathers, officials said. The barge trailed an oil slick that grew to 30 miles long and 100 feet wide in the hours after a Thursday night collision with a tugboat, <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> officials said. Authorities closed 1 -LCB- to 2 miles of beach in the <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Shores </LOCATION> area near here, on the north side of <LOCATION> Grays </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>, where oiled birds were found. The area contains numerous wetlands and marshes that are home to migratory waterfowl. Rescue teams were being mobilized to try and clean and save as many birds as possible, authorities said. `` The latest reports I'm getting indicate an average of 12 dead or distressed birds are being found every quarter of a mile along the beach,'' said <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>, a spokesman for the state Divison of Emergency Management. The leaking barge was towed south to the mouth of the <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, which separates <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. It bobbed 25 miles offshore Friday night while authorities waited for daylight to assess how best to repair it. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state officials estimated some 70,000 gallons of oil had spilled from the barge, said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Steelquist </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION>. The oil was leaking from a tank holding about 250,000 gallons of oil, said <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> Lt. <PERSON> Eldo </PERSON> <PERSON> DeLong </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>. In all, the barge held about 2.75 million gallons of oil, but only the one tank was leaking. <PERSON> Sause </PERSON> <PERSON> Bros </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Ocean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Towing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, of <LOCATION> Coos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, operators of the barge and its tugboat, hired crews to clean up the beaches. The accident occurred Thursday night as a tow line either broke or was being adjusted in heavy seas between the tug <ORGANIZATION> Ocean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> and the barge, named the <LOCATION> Nestucca </LOCATION>. The accident occurred about two miles off <LOCATION> Grays </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>, on the southwestern <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> coast. The barge had been scheduled to make a delivery at <LOCATION> Grays </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>, then head to <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Lauer </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Sause </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bros. </LOCATION>.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> has advised airports worldwide to tighten security because of concern _ not yet confirmed by investigators _ that a terrorist bomb may have caused the <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> crash in <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> Administrator <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> McArtor </PERSON> said Friday the alert was prompted by the crash, the heavy Christmas travel period and `` what obviously can be considered a heightening of world tensions'' regarding terrorist activities. The advisory to beef up security applies to both major <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airports and airlines and foreign airports served by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> carriers, he said. <PERSON> McArtor </PERSON>, in an interview with reporters, declined to discuss specifically Wednesday's crash of <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> Flight 103, in which all 258 people aboard perished. There has been widespread speculation _ and some preliminary indications _ that an explosion may have caused the crash, although no clear evidence of terrorist involvement has yet to surface. Suspicions of sabotage were prompted by the unexplained sudden breakup of the plane, a claim of responsibility and disclosures that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government had been warned of a plot to bomb a <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> flight between <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> in December. The ill-fated Flight 103 originated in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>, with a change of planes in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. <PERSON> McArtor </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> had imposed `` a very heightened level of security'' at <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> airport after the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> alerted the airline in early December that an anonymous threat had been received by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION>, from a caller who said a bomb would be planted aboard a <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> flight from <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>. <PERSON> McArtor </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION>'s precautions at <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Heathrow </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, from which Flight 103 had departed 54 minutes before the crash, were still under review. British officials at the airport said they had not been notified about the specific threat. At <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>, <PERSON> McArtor </PERSON> said, <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> briefed gate personnel about the possible threat, kept ground baggage handlers and caterers `` under constant surveillance'' and checked all luggage by X-ray instead of only at random. All passengers and their bags also were matched prior to boarding, he said. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, leaving the White House for a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> vacation, mourned the victims of the <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> disaster and asked Americans to `` say a special prayer'' this Christmas for families and friends of those killed in the crash. Meanwhile, some aviation safety and crash investigation experts _ though not directly involved in the <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> investigation _ suggested that while the investigation in <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> may take months the cause of the crash is expected to be found. `` It will be a massive job to reconstruct the pieces,'' said <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Schleede </PERSON>, chief of aviation accident investigation at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>. `` But they're going to solve it because the evidence will be there.'' `` We will know what brought down <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> 103,'' <PERSON> McArtor </PERSON> said, but he cautioned `` it could take months.'' Neither <PERSON> McArtor </PERSON> nor <PERSON> Schleede </PERSON>, who has been briefed daily by telephone by <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> officials at the crash site, would discuss specifically the <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> findings so far. But <PERSON> Schleede </PERSON> and other experts noted in interviews that the <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> crash investigators have some advantages. For example: _ Most of the aircraft appeared to have escaped serious fire damage, with the exception of a destroyed right wing where a fuel tank exploded In many crashes where a plane remains intact and burst into flames, critical clues are lost because of the intense heat that bends metal and destroys evidence. _ The wreckage, although strewn across the countryside, is not exposed to ocean elements that could destroy critical evidence If the plane had continued on course it would have been over the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> in less than an hour. _ The cockpit voice recorder and flight data recorder were recovered in apparently good shape In the coming days, investigators will pay close attention to how parts of the aircraft are bent, tangled and singed and whether there is evidence of a chemical residue normally left by an explosive. They also will search for fragments that might have been used as a detonator and closely examine luggage and parts of luggage as well as aircraft wreckage holes left by flying fragments. Such holes leave a distinctive pattern if caused by an explosion, one expert said. Some of the wreckage will be reassembled as closely as possible to the original aircraft and metallurgists will try to determine how the pieces broke apart. The flight data recorder, which monitors the performance of the aircraft, and the cockpit voice recorder will be examined further and their times coordinated. A key question is whether all of the plane's electrical systems were knocked out simultaneously, one veteran investigator said. It is known that Flight 103 in rapid order lost its radar transponder, radio contact and both flight and cockpit voice recorders, this investigator said. If all of these functions failed simultaneously, there is strong evidence of a massive electrical failure, possibly cause by an explosion near the forward baggage compartment, which is adjacent to the electrical and computer systems on the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747, experts suggested.

 The second-degree murder conviction of a woman who claimed the `` baby blues'' caused her to run over her infant son with a car was set aside Friday by a judge who found the woman innocent by reason of insanity. <PERSON> Sheryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Massip </PERSON>, 24, who testified that post-partum depression drove her to kill the colicky, constantly crying boy, was not guilty of murder, said <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzgerald </PERSON>. `` I do not believe the prosecution's evidence established that she had the requisite mental state of malice aforethought,'' the judge said. He said while he knew his ruling was unusual, he felt he had no choice. Unless overturned on appeal by the prosecution, the judge's ruling invalidates a Nov. 17 jury verdict of second-degree murder, which called for a sentence of 15 years to life <PERSON> Fitzgerald </PERSON> delivered what he referred to as an `` unprecedented'' decision: first reducing the charge against her from second-degree murder to voluntary manslaughter, then ruling that she was not guilty by reason of insanity. The decision, however, still leaves the defendant eligible for commitment to a mental hospital for up to 11 years. `` This is new ground that we plowed today,'' the judge said in an interview with the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> Times after issuing his ruling. `` I do n't know of another court that came to a decision like the one I ded to set aside the jury verdict altogether. `` I know people will say I've overstepped my bounds. But the more I thought about it, the more I realized I did n't have any choice but to find her insane. ... She was bonkers.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Massip </PERSON> welcomed the verdict. `` I was praying the people would understand,'' she said outside court. `` The jury did not understand, but I'm thankful that the judge did.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Massip </PERSON> testified at the trial that on April 29, 1987, her own 23rd birthday, she hit her 6-week-old son, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON>, on the head with a garden tool, then put him under the wheels of the family station wagon, ran over him and put his body in a trash can. Defense witnesses said an exceptionally bad case of post-partum depression, a hormonal ailment known as the `` baby blues,'' was to blame. Defense attorney <PERSON> Milton </PERSON> <PERSON> Grimes </PERSON> said the young mother was wracked by lack of sleep and hallucinations and that she heard voices telling her to put the boy out of his misery.

 Down here, where folks wish you a `` Joyeux Noel'' instead of `` Merry Christmas,'' <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION>'s sleigh gives way to <PERSON> Papa </PERSON> <PERSON> Noel </PERSON>'s Cajun canoe and people build bonfires to light his way on Christmas Eve. `` I do n't know how that sleigh would run down here. If it needs snow he'd be in trouble. I guess that's why he comes down the river in a pirogue'' _ a flat-bottomed canoe, said <PERSON> Nolan </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Oubre </PERSON>, the police and fire chief of <LOCATION> Gramercy </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gramercy </PERSON> has a population of 3,600, except for Christmas Eve when upwards of 40,000 people crowd into town for the lighting of the bonfires along the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> levee, <PERSON> Oubre </PERSON> said. For 260-plus years the bonfires have blazed to guide <PERSON> Papa </PERSON> <PERSON> Noel </PERSON> down the <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> to the small south <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> communities about 30 miles north of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>. `` The bonfires are an old tradition passed on from my grandfather and his grandfather and all the other grandfathers, I guess,'' said the 65-year-old <PERSON> Oubre </PERSON>, who has been in charge of building the bonfires for 50 years. People began building the structures they'll torch on Christmas Eve almost a month in advance. `` They used to be just simple teepees but about eight years ago people started getting real imaginative in what they made. Now it's amazing to see what they come up with,'' <PERSON> Oubre </PERSON> said About 100 bonfires a year in the shape of riverboats, plantation homes, cabins and Viking ships spring up on the river banks along a three-mile stretch. In fact, the builders' imaginations soared to such heights that size restrictions were imposed. Bonfires can be no larger than 12-feet wide and no taller than 25 feet. `` Those are about the only restrictions,'' <PERSON> Oubre </PERSON> said. The crowds attracted by the celebration bring traffic that backs up for miles along State 44, but <PERSON> Oubre </PERSON> said he does n't consider it a problem. `` It may be a problem for the folks in the cars, but not for us. They can only go about three or four miles an hour so it's not dangerous and they can watch the bonfires just fine,'' he reasoned. Not everyone will be stacked up in traffic. At least six river boats will carry thousands of people upriver from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION> to watch. `` This is the second year we've done it, and we sold out before we even advertised or planned it this year. We added a third boat, the River Rose, and still have better than 200 people on a waiting list,'' said <PERSON> Anna </PERSON> <PERSON> Catherine </PERSON> <PERSON> Viator </PERSON>, spokeswoman for <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orleans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paddlewheels </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. For between $ 35 and $ 55, those on the various ships get dinner, champagne, jazz and about an eight-hour trip, cruise officials said <PERSON> Oubre </PERSON> and his 12-man crew worked almost three weeks to build a 38-foot-long pyre that looks like a shrimp boat. They cut willow trees, which he said burn best and make a `` beautiful fire,'' and carefully assembled them. <PERSON> Oubre </PERSON> said watching his creations go up in smoke each year is n't sad in spite of the work and time that go into them `` No, that's why you build them,'' he said. `` You've got it in mind all the time to see them burn so you look forward to that part most of all.''

<TEXT>
 Several children broke into a neighbor's house in this <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Panhandle </LOCATION> town, stole presents from underneath a Christmas tree and placed them under their own tree, authorities said. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dixie </PERSON> <PERSON> Shumpert </PERSON> returned from a shopping trip Wednesday evening to find a window broken, their Christmas tree toppled and three presents missing, police said. A broken cane fishing pole and a brick were on the floor near the tree. Deputies say they believe the brick was thrown through the window and the fishing pole was used to reach inside to pull the gifts within grabbing range. <LOCATION> Walton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff's deputies said they followed three sets of child-size footprints to a mobile home across the street and confronted the mother of two of the children. `` The deputies knocked on the door and she was kind of surprised when she saw the presents under the tree,'' <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Shumpert </PERSON> said Thursday. When the children could n't explain to deputies or their mother where the presents came from they admitted they had taken them from the Shumperts' home, rewrapped them and put them under their own tree, said sheriff's Sgt. <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Sutton </PERSON>. Also, he said, two bathroom rugs missing from the neighbors' back porch were wrapped as a Christmas gift. The culprits were two boys, ages 9 and 11, and a 12-year-old girl, <PERSON> Sutton </PERSON> said. The two older children were charged with burglary, petty theft and criminal mischief and then released to their parents pending an appearance before a juvenile judge. No charges were filed against the youngest child. The Shumperts said the stolen gifts were intended for their daughter and two grandchildren.

<TEXT>
 Bickering between <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> is threatening a summit planned for next month by Central American leaders anxious to end the civil wars and hostilities in the region. The latest stumbling block comes from the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> The </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hague </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> agreed this week to hear <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s claims that <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> has been harboring and supporting U.S.-backed rebels, known as Contras, who are fighting <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s leftist government. Honduran Foreign Minister <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> <PERSON> Contreras </PERSON> said Wednesday the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s decision threatens the future of negotiated settlements to the region's problems. He said the court's move is politically charged and sets `` a judicial precedent totally incompatible with peace negotiations.'' In addition, President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Azcona </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoyo </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> has threatened to boycott regional peace talks unless <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> drops its World Court case. <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> and the foreign ministers of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> met earlier this month in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. There they agreed that heads of state would convene in January in an effort to breathe new life into the stalled August 1987 peace plan. The plan sets three-month deadlines for cease-fires in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>. It also mandates that governments of all five nations enact political amnesties and democratic freedoms and reconcile with political opposition groups. It calls for an end to outside aid for rebel insurgencies and a ban on the use of one country's territory to destabilize another. The peace proposal was written by President <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>, who was awarded the 1987 Nobel Peace Prize for his effort. <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> says anti-government Nicaraguan rebels and refugees camp exist on Honduran territory because of a lack of democratic freedoms in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. `` For reasons of national security, <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> does n't want the Contras,'' <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> said. `` Nor do we desire the presence of more than 60,000 refugees from <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>.'' However, <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> can not eject the Contras because, `` We would be accused of being responsible for massacres and violating human rights.'' <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> denounced what he called the Sandinista practice of using international organizations to pressure other nations. But <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> hailed the court's decision, and Nicaraguan President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> should accept it. The same court ruled in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s favor in 1986 in a suit against <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> support of the Contras. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has refused to recognize the court's jurisdiction in the area. As the main judicial organ of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, the court has no enforcement powers. The <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> plan sought to end the Honduran problem as well as long wars in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>. But the heady days following the 1987 signing later turned to disappointment and frustration. The four <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> allies in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> _ <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> _ blame <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and its largest backer, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, for the persistent turmoil. <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> says the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is trying to militarize the region and find a pretext to invade <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. In both <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION>, talks between leftist guerrillas and the two U.S.-backed governments have fallen apart. Wars rage on with no end in sight. In <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> on Friday, leftist rebels attacked the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> with car bombs and explosives, killing at least three people and wounding at least 35, officials said. The assault on the military headquarters compound and on a nearby government health clinic appeared to be part of a major rebel offensive. The regional talks did lead to a cease-fire agreement in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> last March that sharply curtailed fighting there. A month earlier, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government cut off military aid to the Contras. About 10,000 Contra fighters have now moved back to base camps in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. The presidents last met in <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> on Jan. 15, the date set by the <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> plan to mark the end of the wars and full democracy. Instead, they signed a statement vowing to continue their efforts. <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>'s President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON> <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>, whose government is fighting growing rebel activity, said further meetings would be useless unless concrete progress could be made.

 A 10,000-gallon propane truck exploded Friday on a highway, killing seven people, sparking a huge fireball and sending the tanker crashing into a house 125 yards away, officials said. Six people were admitted to hospitals, including one who later died and another in critical condition, and five others were treated and released. A traffic jam caused by the crash led to an accident that claimed a eighth life. `` I heard the explosion and saw the tanker flying through the air. It fell on the house and just blew up,'' said <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, a witness. The wood-frame, duplex house was destroyed and a 10-year-old girl inside died, authorities said. An elderly woman also inside the house died later of her burns. The six other deaths, including the driver of the truck, and most of the injuries occurred mainly on Interstate 240 near downtown as the fireball engulfed the truck and several other vehicles, said fire Capt. <PERSON> Benny </PERSON> <PERSON> McDow </PERSON>. The people taken to hospitals suffered mostly from burns, <PERSON> McDow </PERSON> said. One was listed in critical condition early Saturday in the burn unit of the <ORGANIZATION> Regional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> and four other people were also hospitalized. O Authorities issued tentative identifications, but said dental records would have to be used for positive identification, because some of the bodies were so badly burned. The propane truck apparently skidded off an exit ramp on Interstate 240 as the driver tried to turn onto Interstate 40 toward <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, <PERSON> McDow </PERSON> said. The roadway was dry. `` He was trying to exit and lost control and hit a retaining wall,'' <PERSON> McDow </PERSON> said. `` That exit there is short. It's one of those tight turns.'' <PERSON> Jed </PERSON> <PERSON> Tennison </PERSON>, who works at a sheet metal plant near the crash scene, said he rushed to a highway overpass when he heard the explosion. `` There was a guy on fire rolling on the road and there was another just lying on the ground where somebody must have put him,'' <PERSON> Tennison </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Gaines </PERSON> <PERSON> Tennison </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jed </PERSON>'s father and manager of the sheet metal plant, said he felt the shock of the blast and looked out to see what had happened. `` I thought it was an earthquake,'' he said. `` The whole sky was white, just lit up. You could feel the heat inside the building.'' <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, a deputy chief in charge of fire department crews on the scene, said victims killed by the blast had little chance to escape the flames. `` There was a huge fireball, maybe 700 to 800 feet. It engulfed three or four cars,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. In addition to the destroyed duplex, the fireball damaged five houses, three on one side and two on the other side of the six-lane highway, authorities said. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Edgeston </PERSON>, who lives two doors away from the destroyed duplex, said a truck axle with four wheels attached ended up in his kitchen. He suffered a cut on the head but was not seriously hurt. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Stonecipher </PERSON>, a city fire marshal, said the tanker ruptured on one end and blasted off like a rocket when the fuel ignited. `` It was like an unguided missile,'' he said. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> planned to send a team of investigators, said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Benson </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Authorities tentatively identified the victims as <PERSON> Shelanda </PERSON> <PERSON> Towles </PERSON>, 10, killed in her house; <PERSON> Randall </PERSON> <PERSON> Benson </PERSON>, 29, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ark. </LOCATION>, the propane tanker driver; and four people who were in vehicles near the exploding truck: <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, 34, <LOCATION> Brighton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wardlow </PERSON>, 40, <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>; and <PERSON> Tina </PERSON> <PERSON> Wiles </PERSON>, 30, and her father-in-law, <PERSON> Warner </PERSON> <PERSON> Wiles </PERSON>, 70, both of <LOCATION> Vicksburg </LOCATION>, Miss. The elderly woman who was inside the duplex with <PERSON> Shelanda </PERSON> was not identified because her family had not been notified, said police traffic Lt. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Krepela </PERSON>. After the accident, traffic backed up for several miles north and south of town. A second truck driver was killed when his 18-wheeler plowed into the rear of a car tied up in the traffic jam, police said. That driver was identified as <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON>, 29, of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Helena </LOCATION>, Ark.

 A crack addict desperate for treatment brought police his paraphernalia, then smashed windows at two precincts before a judge relented and sentenced him to a drug program he calls his `` best Christmas gift yet.'' `` I will thank him for giving me an opportunity for starting my life back over. He is an understanding man, one of very few,'' <PERSON> Alexis </PERSON> <PERSON> Vega </PERSON> said Friday of <ORGANIZATION> Bronx </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Criminal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>. <PERSON> Vega </PERSON>, 34, said his life had bordered on the insane until <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> sentenced him to 90 days in a drug treatment program. As a crack cocaine addict, <PERSON> Vega </PERSON> lost his job as a construction worker. He stopped paying bills. He became irresponsible and dirty. His wife of two years, <PERSON> Josephine </PERSON> <PERSON> Coulter </PERSON>, feared for their 11-month-old son and her two daughters, now 12 and 13. Last July, <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Coulter </PERSON> threw him out of their home in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s tough <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> section `` because I was doing wrong,'' he said. `` She is a Christian and I did n't want to be around her.'' `` It's bad to see a good husband turn into a monster.

He was getting out of hand.'' <PERSON> Vega </PERSON> knew he was getting out of hand, so he turned for help. He applied for admission at several <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> hospital programs and one in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>. `` They all told me they were filled up. Until February or the end of January. That was too far for me to look forward to,'' <PERSON> Vega </PERSON> said. On Oct. 28, he sought help from the desk sergeant at the 47th Precinct. That did not work, so <PERSON> Vega </PERSON> tried something else: He placed a syringe and some crack vials on the sergeant's desk. `` I did n't know what else to do,'' <PERSON> Vega </PERSON> said. `` They roughed me up. They were very shocked that I did this. They did n't understand.'' And neither did the judge who handled the case, releasing him two days later without sending him to treatment. On Nov. 5, <PERSON> Vega </PERSON> tossed a chair through the window of the 48th Precinct. Another judge put him in the streets without treatment. On Nov. 14, he threw a padlock through a window of the 46th Precinct. He was processed by a third judge who did not offer treatment. `` I told them I needed help,'' <PERSON> Vega </PERSON> said. All the pending cases of drug charges and criminal mischief came together Dec. 1 before <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, who decided to do something. `` I got a call from the judge on Tuesday the 20th. From the judge himself,'' said <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Sierra </PERSON>, a worker at and graduate of <ORGANIZATION> Way </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Out </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` It was strange. To me, a judge has a lot to do. He went out of his way to help this particular person. The probation report was not favorable.'' <ORGANIZATION> Sierra </ORGANIZATION> said the program, which is funded by donations and other churches, has 58 beds and 600 people on the waiting list. One bed was available and <PERSON> Vega </PERSON> got it. <PERSON> Vega </PERSON>, who had previously written to the program, was given a 90-day sentence Wednesday to Way Out. `` He's got a long way to go here,'' <ORGANIZATION> Sierra </ORGANIZATION> said. `` It is a strain on his life. We are a very strict program.'' `` Strict'' means no leaving the program for two months, no visitors, no cursing, no smoking and plenty of prayer. The <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION> <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Attorney </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Gentile </PERSON>, commended the judge and said `` this case dramatizes the critical need for treatment upon demand for all individuals addicted to drugs.'' No one knows it better than <PERSON> Vega </PERSON>, who said, `` I think -LRB- the judge -RRB- gave me the best Christmas gift yet, to redeem my life back over.''

<TEXT>
 The search for survivors of the Armenian earthquake is over, and crews will now focus solely on clearing away tons of concrete and debris so rebuilding can begin, a government official said. No one has been found alive in the mountains of bricks, splintered wood and steel since Thursday, when workers pulled a woman from what used to be a building in <LOCATION> Leninakan </LOCATION>. She later died. `` We did everything to sift the ruins to save the lives of whomever might be under them. At this time, we know that no one can be alive,'' <PERSON> Vardkes </PERSON> <PERSON> Artsruny </PERSON>, a deputy prime minister of <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>, said in an interview Friday. `` The gigantic problem now is the cleanup,'' he said, speaking in makeshift offices previously used as a children's center. Lights in the two-story relief headquarters sputtered as he spoke because of the varying levels of power provided by portable generators. During a blackout Friday, he met with agricultural officials by candlelight. Fields around <LOCATION> Leninakan </LOCATION>, whose shoddy buildings collapsed when the earth shook Dec. 7, are filled with debris. Twisted wire and remains of stairs protrude from piles of formless rubble trucked from the Armenian republic's second-largest city. Rescuers said a 16-year-old boy was found alive Monday, 12 days after the quake, in the remains of a nine-story building. A bed apparently shielded him from tons of concrete raining down. One of the boy's arms was broken. He asked rescuers to bandage his eyes so he would n't be blinded when exposed to light after so many days. <LOCATION> Leninakan </LOCATION>, on a mountain plateau near the Turkish border, had a population of 280,000 before the quake. About 18,000 people were found in the ruins, 8,000 of whom survived. Survivors taking part in the rescue, aided by 20,000 workers from elsewhere in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and 15,000 soldiers, live in heated tents sent from the Russian republic and in yurts, shepherds' tents sent by Kazakhs and <ORGANIZATION> Mongols </ORGANIZATION>. Workers have nearly completed disinfecting and burying about 80,000 carcasses of cattle, sheep and pigs killed in villages, the official news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported. In a dispatch today, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> estimated agricultural damage to <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> at about $ 3.2 billion. Of 342 populated areas in the quake zone, 58 were destroyed, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. Government officials have said <LOCATION> Leninakan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Spitak </LOCATION> and the dozens of other cities and towns of northwestern <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> destroyed by the quake will be rebuilt in two years, but <PERSON> Artsruny </PERSON> said it may take longer. `` It's not important that we reconstruct <LOCATION> Leninakan </LOCATION> in two years and three months,'' he said. `` It's the fact that we're doing it.'' <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION>, the government newspaper, said Friday authorities had not decided whether to rebuild <LOCATION> Leninakan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Spitak </LOCATION> on the same sites or move them to nearby spots less susceptible to earthquakes. The quake has brought world figures to <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> as well as rescuers. President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s son and grandson are scheduled to visit <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> on Christmas Day to help distribute American aid. <PERSON> Jeb </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, 35, a <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> real estate developer, and his 12-year-old son, <PERSON> George </PERSON>, will spend about six hours in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>, according to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s office in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Most Armenians are devout Christians, but like other members of Eastern churches, will celebrate Christmas on Jan. 6. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid has come in many forms. American volunteers are putting up 100 plastic shelters at <LOCATION> Spitak </LOCATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said American seismologists were establishing 25 earthquake monitoring stations in the area of the quake's epicenter. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> said it would shift its effort from immediate to long-term assistance, including buiding a hospital. President <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schubert </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> has received $ 3.5 million in cash contributions and pledges.

<HEAD>Christmas Eve Disaster Still A Touchy Subject</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CALUMET, Mich. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The trampling deaths and suffocations of 73 people on Christmas Eve remain a touchy subject in this town, even though the tragedy occurred 75 years old today. `` I do n't suppose it will ever heal,'' said amateur historian <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Foster </PERSON>, a resident of <LOCATION> Calumet </LOCATION>. It happened when a false fire alarm was sounded during a party for children in 1913, at the height of a bitter strike at copper mines in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Upper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION>. `` The death certificates blame persons unknown and some of the stories are so insidious that I understand why over the years people in the town did n't want to talk about it,'' said <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> Germain </PERSON>, a former Calumet council member. Even so, the town council voted Tuesday to hold a memorial service today at the site where the hall once stood. Planned are a non-denominational prayer service, a candlelight vigil, and the reading of the victims' names. Nobody ever discovered who sounded the false alarm, <PERSON> Foster </PERSON> said. Union and company supporters blamed each other for the strike violence they attributed to the disaster. Unionized members of the <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Miners </ORGANIZATION> had been on strike for 10 months over the <LOCATION> Calumet </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Hecla </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mining </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s decision to switch from two-man drills to one-man drills The <ORGANIZATION> WFM </ORGANIZATION> contended the new drill was unsafe. In June 1913, more than 14,000 unionized miners and 1,500 mill and smelter workers were laid off as <LOCATION> Calumet </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Hecla </ORGANIZATION> moved to reopen its mines with non-union workers, according to an account by historian <PERSON> Angus </PERSON> <PERSON> Murdock </PERSON>. That fall, two company guards chased a striker into a boarding house in <LOCATION> Calumet </LOCATION> and fired gunshots, killing two men. The guards claimed they had been shot at first. Then on Dec. 7, three non-union Canadian miners were gunned down as they slept in a second boarding house. Days later, a miner and a guard were killed in another shootout. It was in that atmosphere that the <ORGANIZATION> WFM </ORGANIZATION> women's committee held a Christmas party for the children of striking miners on the second floor of Calumet's Italian Hall, above a saloon. The party was under way, witnesses said, when someone from the first floor stairwell shouted out a fire alarm. Children and adults panicked to escape, tripping over each other to get into the stairwell and out the only exit. Witnesses said 57 children and 16 adults were crushed to death or suffocated before anyone realized what was happening. `` I was so scared,'' said <PERSON> Lena </PERSON> <PERSON> Rigotti </PERSON>, an 88-year-old <PERSON> Hurley </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, nursing home resident who survived the tragedy. `` I told my sister, ` Stay with me and we'll get home.' I do n't know how we ever made it.''' National Guard troops were ordered out to keep the peace, and a congressional investigation was held. The <ORGANIZATION> WFM </ORGANIZATION> called a halt to the strike that next spring.

<HEAD>China White, One of Most Powerful Drugs Known, Triggers New Deaths</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PITTSBURGH (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Authorities say 18 victims in one of the nation's longest string of deaths caused by <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> White, a powerful synthetic heroin, were at the mercy of dealers who do n't check the quality of drugs they sell. `` There's no way to prevent this,'' <LOCATION> Allegheny </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Coroner <PERSON> Joshua </PERSON> <PERSON> Perper </PERSON> said. `` Anybody who has the knowledge to produce a so-called designer drug can cause this sort of thing.'' The drug, 3-methylfentanyl, has been confirmed as the cause of 18 overdose deaths in the <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> area, <PERSON> Perper </PERSON> said. Laboratory tests are under way for five others. The drug also is suspected in as many as 60 non-fatal overdoses. `` Our information from the street is that -LRB- dealers -RRB- marketed it as a real powerful heroin,'' <ORGANIZATION> Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assistant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> Chief <PERSON> Chester </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> said. `` They had no idea of its potency. Three granules are enough for one dose. We consider it one of the most powerful drugs known.'' Twelve people have been arrested, including <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schaefers </PERSON>, 48, of suburban <PERSON> Aspinwall </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Calgon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> chemist suspected as the source of the narcotic. The deaths were the longest series of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> White fatalities outside <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, where the drug surfaced 11 years ago. `` This is really the first major incident outside of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> from a clandestine laboratory putting material on the street,'' said <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON>, professor of pharmacology at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California-Davis </ORGANIZATION> medical school. `` And it's certainly the most fentanyl activity we've seen since 1984.'' <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON> developed a method of testing for the presence of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> White and drugs with similar compositions, fentanyl analogs, in overdose victims and is helping city, county and federal officials in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> with their investigation. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> White, also called Persian Heroin and <PERSON> Gasoline </PERSON> <PERSON> Dope </PERSON>, is several hundred times more powerful than heroin, and even extremely small amounts can be fatal. It can be manufactured by anyone with a background in college chemistry, according to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Abuse </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Rockville </LOCATION>, Md. Federal authorities first noticed the presence of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> White in December 1979, when two users died in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON> said 115 have people died from fentanyl overdoses in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> since 1980. The number of annual deaths in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> peaked at 50 in 1984, just before the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> cracked a drug ring in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. Eighteen people died there in 1985, and one died in 1986. Most of the dead in the <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> area were men in their 30s who took the drug either by itself or with heroin and cocaine, <PERSON> Perper </PERSON> said. Authorities began investigating after noticing a rash of fatal and non-fatal overdoses in September, October and November. Seven people were arrested Dec. 1, including <PERSON> Schaefers </PERSON>, who lived with his elderly parents and had no record of prior involvement with illegal drugs, investigators said. All seven were charged with manufacturing and distributing the drug. Four were charged with supplying the dose that killed <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Duschl </PERSON>, 38, of <LOCATION> Verona </LOCATION> on June 2 and injured <PERSON> Brenda </PERSON> <PERSON> Drennan </PERSON>, 29, formerly of <LOCATION> Harmar </LOCATION> on May 22. Three are charged with selling the dose that killed <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Kostopodis </PERSON>, 41, of <LOCATION> Bellevue </LOCATION> on July 24. Five others suspected to be lower-level dealers were arrested in November. Schaefers has been suspended without pay pending results of the investigation, <ORGANIZATION> Calgon </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Erdner </PERSON> said.

 An internationally acclaimed ecologist who led a fight to save <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s tropical forests was ambushed and killed in a remote jungle village, police said. The victim, 44-year-old <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Mendes </PERSON>, said two weeks ago that his life had been threatened. <PERSON> Mendes </PERSON> was shot Thursday night when he stepped outside his home in <LOCATION> Xapuri </LOCATION>, a western village near the Bolivian border, said <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> Chief <PERSON> Mauro </PERSON> <PERSON> Sposito </PERSON>. <PERSON> Mendes </PERSON> was playing dominos with friends and two police bodyguards assigned to care for him when he went to take a shower in an outdoor stall, <PERSON> Sposito </PERSON> said in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Branco </LOCATION>, 2,650 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Janeiro </LOCATION>. Moments later, <PERSON> Mendes </PERSON> was shot once in the upper chest with a rifle at point-blank range, the chief said. The killers fled before the bodyguards could leave the house, he said. The shooting occurred a half-block from the local police precinct. Police made no arrests and said there were no definite suspects. `` There was no way to stop them -LRB- the killers -RRB-,'' <PERSON> Nilson </PERSON> <PERSON> Alves </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Xapuri </LOCATION> police officer, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> by telephone. `` It was starting to get dark, we only had one search lamp, and the jungle is pretty thick in these parts.'' <PERSON> Mendes </PERSON> was known worldwide for leading a campaign against <ORGANIZATION> Amazon </ORGANIZATION> rain forest destruction. He was a representative for the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and other international lending institutions in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and tried to stop loans to <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> for development of the region. <PERSON> Mendes </PERSON> said he received repeated death threats for organizing demonstrations against deforestation of the <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> rain forest by cattle ranchers and was under local police protection. In June 1987, he was honored by the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> for leading members of a local union in a fight to preserve the <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> jungle. The Rubber Tappers Union often staged peaceful `` empate,'' or stalemate demonstrations, by standing in front of bulldozers with family members and friends in areas where acres of forestland were being cleared for grazing. Two union members were fatally shot in October. On Dec. 9, <PERSON> Mendes </PERSON> told a news conference in <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Janeiro </LOCATION> he had received death threats from <PERSON> Darly </PERSON> and <PERSON> Alvarnho </PERSON> <PERSON> Alves </PERSON>, brothers and ranch owners who had past conflicts with the <ORGANIZATION> Rubber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tappers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>. The debate over how to develop the <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> jungle, a vast expanse of rain forest about two-fifths the size of the continental <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, has led to frequent violence. Land disputes involving squatters, environmentalists and landowners have caused about 250 deaths a year since 1985. <PERSON> Mendes </PERSON>, who is survived by a wife and two children, is to buried today in <LOCATION> Xapuri </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Judge Throws Out Jury's Murder Verdict Against `Baby Blues' Mother</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTA ANA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A murder conviction returned against a mother who admitted killing her ailing son by running him over with a car was rejected by a judge who said the woman was driven insane by post-childbirth depression. Superior Court Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzgerald </PERSON>, in announcing his ruling, said he believed <PERSON> Sheryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Massip </PERSON>, 24, was made insane by what some health experts call postpartum depression or `` baby blues.'' `` I know people will say I've overstepped my bounds,'' <PERSON> Fitzgerald </PERSON> told a stunned <ORGANIZATION> Orange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> courtroom as he announced the decision Friday. `` But the more I thought about it, the more I realized I did n't have a choice but to find her insane. ... She was bonkers.'' Prosecutors said they will review whether an appeal can be filed on grounds that <PERSON> Fitzgerald </PERSON>'s ruling went beyond his authority. `` We believe, on a cursory review of material, that he exceeded his authority,'' Deputy District Attorney <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Borris </PERSON> said. `` We believe the best that he could have done is order a new trial.'' <PERSON> Borris </PERSON> also said <PERSON> Fitzgerald </PERSON> did n't first inform attorneys about his decision, as judges often do when they are about to issue a reversal. The judge said afterward that he had not decided what the ruling would be until the moment he delivered it. Ms. <PERSON> Massip </PERSON>, 24, had been convicted of second-degree murder. <PERSON> Fitzgerald </PERSON> reduced the charge to voluntary manslaughter, but then ruled that she was not guilty by reason of insanity, essentially negating the voluntary manslaughter conviction. She still faces a maximum sentence of 11 years confinement in a mental hospital. Her jury conviction called for 15 years to life in prison. The judge ordered Ms. <PERSON> Massip </PERSON> to surrender Feb. 3 for at least 90 days of psychiatric observation. He then will decide if she needs further treatment. Ms. <PERSON> Massip </PERSON>'s family burst into cheers after the decision, which came during a hearing originally scheduled for her sentencing on the murder conviction. `` I could n't have asked God for a better Christmas present,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Massip </PERSON>, who read a Bible before the decision. `` I got the gift of life.'' Her former husband, <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Massip </PERSON>, whom she testified refused to help care for the child, fled the court in tears and refused to talk to reporters. He divorced Ms. <PERSON> Massip </PERSON> shortly after her arrest. During her trial, Ms. <PERSON> Massip </PERSON> admitted killing her 6-week old son, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON>. But she testified that the child cried 15 to 18 hours a day, adding that she heard voices telling her to put the infant out of his misery. Experts summoned to testify by her lawyer said she had a severe case of postpartum depression, brought on by hormonal imbalance sometimes associated with childbirth. The rare disorder is believed to spur severe anxiety, delusions and even violence in approximately three of every 1,000 new mothers. On April 29, 1987, Ms. <PERSON> Massip </PERSON>'s 23rd birthday, she tried to toss the child in front of a car near her <LOCATION> Fullerton </LOCATION> home, but the driver swerved and missed him. She then beat the infant on the head and finally placed him face-up under the tire of her <ORGANIZATION> Volvo </ORGANIZATION> station wagon and ran him over. After the killing, she first told investigators the child had been stolen by a red-haired mystery woman with a gun. But the child's body was found in a trash can. `` The pain has n't gone away. I have to live with the death of my son, the loss of my son, for the rest of my life,'' Ms. <PERSON> Massip </PERSON> said after the ruling. `` I pray that this does n't happen to anyone else.'' The judge's decision came after an impassioned plea from defense attorney <PERSON> Milton </PERSON> <PERSON> Grimes </PERSON>. `` There's nothing in human experience that can justify what <PERSON> Sheryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Massip </PERSON> did ... other than the fact that she was crazy at the time,'' <PERSON> Grimes </PERSON> argued.

 British transportation minister <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Channon </PERSON> is vacationing in the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION>, drawing angry cries from home because his department is in charge of investigating the <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> jet crash in <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>. `` It is unbelievable,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Prescott </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s opposition <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> on Friday, after <PERSON> Channon </PERSON> left for <LOCATION> Barbados </LOCATION> <PERSON> Channon </PERSON> and his wife, <PERSON> Ingrid </PERSON>, made no comment after landing later Friday in <LOCATION> Bridgetown </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Channon </PERSON> was seen checking in with <ORGANIZATION> Mustique </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> and was believed to be flying to <LOCATION> Mustique </LOCATION>, a tiny island about 40 miles away that is a popular and exclusive getaway spot. `` It is quite intolerable and totally insensitive for the transport secretary to leave for his holidays so soon after <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s worst aviation disaster, when bodies are still being retrieved and a major security review is under way,'' said <PERSON> Prescott </PERSON>, his party's transport spokesman. Investigators are still searching for dozens of bodies and for clues to what caused <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> Flight 103 to break apart in the air Wednesday night. The <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 plummeted into the Scottish village of <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION>, killing all 258 people on board and leaving 20 people on the ground missing and feared dead. The British Embassy in <LOCATION> Barbados </LOCATION> said it had no information on <PERSON> Channon </PERSON>'s visit because he was not on official business. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Channon </PERSON> would be kept informed on the investigation and planned to return soon after Christmas but would fly home earlier if necessary. <PERSON> Prescott </PERSON> said <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>, the Conservative prime minister, should `` call him back immediately'' and declared: `` Such lack of judgment should justify his removal.'' <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickens </PERSON>, a Conservative member of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, said Labor was `` trying to make capital out of other people's misery and death.''

<TEXT>
 Investigators today were analyzing a faint noise heard in the final moments of a cockpit tape-recording for clues to whether a bomb downed <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> Flight 103 while it was flying six miles above <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>. `` There were no abnormal noises on the tape until the signals ended abruptly with the aircraft cruising at 31,000 feet,'' said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> McKie </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> whose Air Accident Investigation Branch is studying the tapes. Nothing in the cockpit conversations preceding the Wednesday night crash was unusual until the `` faint noise at the end, which needs a bit more analysis,'' he said. NBC News quoted unidentified <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials as saying the top <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> official in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, was on the jet. The report Friday night did not name the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> official, and the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> refused comment on whether a <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> official was on the plane. The search continued today for bodies and clues, and police said there would be no break for Christmas. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Learmount </PERSON>, a respected aviation editor at Flight International, the industry magazine, said the `` black box'' recording supported the theory that a bomb caused the crash, which killed all 258 people aboard and devastated the Scottish village of <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION> with its flaming wreckage. Twenty townspeople were missing and feared dead, including drivers of three cars caught in the inferno. `` The black boxes have told us that it was an instantaneous catastrophe. That is why the bomb theory's very much the favorite,'' <PERSON> Learmount </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> on Friday night. `` The bomb theory explains everything which happened. ... If this case was just simple metal fatigue failure, it would have had to have been cataclysmic, really extraordinarily unlikely. But if it did happen, we really have to know and know fast,'' he said. But <PERSON> Mick </PERSON> <PERSON> Charles </PERSON>, head of a team of 40 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and British investigators at the site, said, `` We have no evidence whatsoever yet of sabotage.'' Strong suspicions of a terrorist bombing built swiftly following an Iranian group's claim of responsibility, the revelation that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government had been warned of a threat against a <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> plane, and the fact the plane suddenly broke apart in flight. Anger at the government's failure to notify the public of the threat _ against a <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> jet flying from <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> sometime in December _ surfaced Friday when it became known the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> notified <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. The government's reticence meant `` the poor, ignorant traveling public taking greater risks,'' charged <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Prescott </PERSON> of the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Beaumont-Dark </PERSON> of the governing Conservatives agreed. Transport Minister <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Portillo </PERSON>, responding to the criticism, said the threat, phoned in to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> on Dec. 5, was `` confidential, classified <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence information and we did n't have the right to divulge it.'' <LOCATION> Heathrow </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>'s security for American flights was reviewed and determined to be strict enough not to warrant divulging the anonymous threat, <PERSON> Portillo </PERSON> said on <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> television. Victims' relatives began to arrive in <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION>, a community of 2,500, to claim their dead. Seven Americans were among the arrivals, who were being counseled by social workers. Makeshift morgues in the town hall and in an ice rink have received 155 bodies, and the search goes on. Wreaths appeared outside the morgues. One bouquet, from a passenger who took Flight 103 from <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, was to a child flying on to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` To the little girl in the red dress who lies here, who made my flight from <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> such fun. You did n't deserve this,'' the note said. Officers hacked open the nose section of the plane, which lay on its side in a field, and troops carried away the bodies of the crew. Fourteen adults and three children from <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION> remained unaccounted for and there was no word on the occupants of three cars hit by wreckage and gutted on a nearby highway, Police Superintendent <PERSON> Angus </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said. The missing toll had been 22, but one man was found to have been treated for injuries Wednesday and released, and another was accidentally listed twice as missing. More than 600 troops and police, assisted by rescue experts and dogs, criss-crossed wide areas of the countryside looking for bodies and any fragment that might help explain the crash. An <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> jumbo jet bound for <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> with 250 people aboard returned to <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> on Friday afternoon after <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> India </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> received an anonymous bomb threat, officials said. It was evacuated at <LOCATION> Heathrow </LOCATION>, but the airline announced nothing suspicious was immiedately found. Passengers were offered seats on a flight today.

 Newspapers today published Christmas letters to American hostages <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Sutherland </PERSON> and to British captive <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> from their family and friends. The U.S.-based Journalists' Committee to Free <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> urged the pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem Islamic Jihad to free the journalist and <PERSON> Sutherland </PERSON> `` in the name of humanity.'' `` As <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Sutherland </PERSON> face their fourth Christmas and New Year holidays as hostages, we, their friends and colleagues, ask you once again in the name of humanity to set them and others you are holding free,'' the committee said in a 20-line letter. An Arabic translation was published by five of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s 14 daily papers. The independent An-Nahar and conservative Ad-Diyar also published the original English text in the apparent hope <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sutherland </PERSON> would be allowed to read it. The two men did not know Arabic when they were kidnapped. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, 41, of <LOCATION> Lorain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, the chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, is the longest-held of the 15 foreign hostages. He was kidnapped March 16, 1985. <PERSON> Sutherland </PERSON>, 56, of <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Collins </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colo. </LOCATION>, was acting dean of agriculture at the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beirut </ORGANIZATION> when he was abducted June 9, 1985. The letter noted that on July 24, <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s most prestigious Shiite religious leader, <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> <PERSON> Fadlallah </PERSON>, `` acknowledged the human suffering of the foreign hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and said that the time has come for a happy ending to their plight.'' `` At this special time of year, we ask that you consider <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Fadlallah </PERSON>'s words and bring an end to this tragedy for the foreign hostages and their families,'' it said. <PERSON> Fadlallah </PERSON> is the reputed mentor of the Iranian-backed <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or Party of God, believed to be the umbrella for Islamic Jihad and other factions holding hostages. <PERSON> Fadlallah </PERSON> on Friday reiterated his call for the release of the hostages on condition that Iranian, <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> and Lebanese captives held by Lebanese Christians, the Israelis and their allies were also freed. `` There should be no distinction among kidnap victims,'' <PERSON> Fadlallah </PERSON> said at a sermon in southern <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. `` Let the cry be for the release of all hostages with no discrimination. Let's treat the case from its humanitarian angle. Let us preserve the humanity of all the captives.'' Three Iranians and their Shiite driver were seized by militiamen of the right-wing Lebanese Forces, the Christians' main militia, when they drove across the Christian enclave north of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> during the 1982 Israeli invasion of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. All are believed dead. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and its militia allies of the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lebanon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> hold hundreds of <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> and Lebanese Shiites. The journalists' committee called on the kidnappers to `` please relay to <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> and <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> and others that they are not forgotten. `` Their friends and families pray for them every day and there are many people who work every day for the time when they are free and return to the light and the love of their families.'' It said that the kidnappers' `` serious consideration of this request is appreciated by many. We hope that the new year brings peace to all the peoples of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>.'' <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s leftist As-Safir daily published letters in English to <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>, a producer for the London-based <ORGANIZATION> Worldwide </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>. They were paid for by his parents and friends. <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>, 32, of <LOCATION> Barnet </LOCATION>, north <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, was kidnapped April 17, 1986. A three-line message signed by his parents said: `` All our love <PERSON> John </PERSON>. Happy Christmas and we're sure we'll see you soon.'' <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>'s fiancee, <PERSON> Jill </PERSON> <PERSON> Morell </PERSON>, wrote: `` Darling <PERSON> John </PERSON>, we are spending another Christmas wishing you were here with us. `` Do n't despair. Try to keep your spirits up and be sure you'll be home with us soon. A friend of <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON>'s, identified only as <PERSON> Sean </PERSON>, wrote: `` You are in our thoughts and prayers.''

 The Broadway comedy `` Checkmates'' is to close Jan. 1, less than three weeks after it was revealed that a co-producer is serving a 28-years-to-life prison term in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Quentin </LOCATION> for attempted murder. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Attorney </LOCATION>'s office in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> has also indicted the co-producer, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, on drug conspiracy charges. The play, a comedy about two married couples in an apartment building, opened Aug. 4 and will have had 177 regular performances and 17 previews when it closes. It stars <PERSON> Ruby </PERSON> <PERSON> Dee </PERSON>, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Winfield </PERSON>, <PERSON> Denzel </PERSON> <PERSON> Washington </PERSON> and <PERSON> Marsha </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. A production spokesman, <PERSON> Adrian </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryan-Brown </PERSON>, said poor box-office receipts led the show's two remaining producers to decide to close it. The decision was also based on <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s intention to leave the show to do a movie, and his stand-by's television project, the spokesman said. <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, 26, who with a partner put up half of the $ 770,000 it cost to take the show to <LOCATION> Broadway </LOCATION>, received producer's billing on posters for the comedy until it was revealed earlier this month that he had been convicted of killing a man he accused of stealing from a drug operation. The play was originally produced in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> by <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hayward </PERSON> <PERSON> Collins </PERSON>.

 Fuel oil darkened the sand at this resort town and soaked at least 50 birds after an oil spill of at least 70,000 gallons from a ship collision left a slick 30 miles long, authorities said. Authorities closed 1 -LCB- to 2 miles of beach in the area near here along the central <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> coast, where oiled birds were found. The area contains numerous wetlands and marshes that are home to migratory waterfowl. The collision occurred Thursday night after a towline snapped in heavy seas, causing a tugboat from <PERSON> Sause </PERSON> <PERSON> Bros </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Ocean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Towing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, of <LOCATION> Coos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, to collide with the barge <PERSON> Nestucca </PERSON>. Authorities estimated 70,000 gallons of oil leaked from the barge off <LOCATION> Grays </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> by late Friday, said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Steelquist </PERSON> of the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> officials said more was escaping as the vessel pitched and tossed in 15-foot swells about 25 miles off the coast. In <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> Lt. Cmdr. <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> Nolan </PERSON> said the spill was about 30 miles long and 100 feet wide. No damage or cleanup cost estimate was immediately available. Global Diving and <ORGANIZATION> Salvage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> was hired by <ORGANIZATION> Sause </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bros. </ORGANIZATION> to clean up the mess, said <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> of the state <ORGANIZATION> Ecology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. The leaking barge was towed south Friday night to the mouth of the <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, which separates <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Company and government officials were planning to decide today whether to try to make repairs at sea or tow the barge to a port on the river. <LOCATION> Grays </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Morrisette </PERSON> closed a mile and a half of beaches as state <ORGANIZATION> Ecology </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials prepared a rescue effort for oil-soaked birds. At least 50 oil-soaked birds had been found by late Friday. `` The latest reports I'm getting indicate an average of 12 dead or distressed birds are being found every quarter of a mile along the beach,'' said <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON> of the state Division of Emergency Management. Western Wildlife Rescue and Volunteers for Outdoor <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> established a bird-cleaning and recovery operation Friday at <LOCATION> Our </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lady </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Good </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Help </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Hoquiam </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Morrisette </PERSON>, who doubles as county director of emergency services, said the sand was darker than normal in the area. The Nestucca carried 2.7 million gallons of oil, but the only reported damage was a gash about 18 inches below the main deck in a tank containing about 250,000 gallons.

 <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> officials searched a <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles-bound </LOCATION> jet for explosives to calm passenger fears that a woman who deplaned had left a bomb on the jet.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Moslem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> militia have reached a new peace pact to end their bloody 3-year conflict, <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> newspapers reported today. The papers published the 11-point pact, which is the sixth since 1985 when Amal moved against Palestinian refugee camps to prevent <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> from rebuilding a power base in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The five earlier accords fell apart, and there is widespread doubt the latest accord will hold. More than 3,000 people have been killed and 10,000 wounded in the Amal-PLO conflict. Amal has an estimated 10,000 armed militiamen. The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> has 4,500 guerrillas based in the <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION> region, 25 miles south of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, which supports Amal, last month withdrew 66 truce observers from the highlands east of <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION>. That raised fears of major clashes, but so far only localized skirmishes have occurred. The new pact provides for a disengagement of forces and the removal of frontline barricades to enforce a cease-fire between Amal and the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> around <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION>, provincial capital of south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The conflict has centered on the city and its environs since <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s fighters were driven out of their strongholds in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>'s refugee camps by rival Syrian-backed Palestinian factions in July, something <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> had failed to do Amal and the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> pledged in the accord to resolve friction by peaceful means and reopen all roads in the region for unrestricted movement. The accord stipulated that Amal should lift its 3-year siege of the Rashadiyeh refugee camp in the southern port of Tyre. About 18,000 Palestinians live there. It also provided for repairing the devastation in <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Ein </PERSON> el-Hilweh and Mieh Mieh camps and repatriating thousands of displaced Palestinians and Shiites in the region. The leftist Sunni Moslem Nasserite militia, which has stayed neutral in the Amal-PLO conflict, will oversee the new cease-fire.

 Col. <PERSON> Moammar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> said he is willing to hand over the body of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> pilot killed during the 1986 air raid on <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, the official news agency <ORGANIZATION> JANA </ORGANIZATION> reported today. <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> said the body of Capt. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorence </PERSON> would be given to his family `` through the pope,'' said the agency, monitored in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Lorence </PERSON>, 31, of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Ribas-Dominicci </PERSON>, 33, of <LOCATION> Utuado </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, were in an F-111 that disappeared during the April 15, 1986, raid on <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Benghazi </LOCATION>. The other 17 <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> bombers returned safely to their bases after dropping about 100 tons of bombs on the two cities. The attack was in retaliation for what the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration said was <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>'s support for international terrorism. Libyan authorities said the raids killed about 40 people, including <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON>'s 15-month-old adopted daughter. `` The brother leader has also invited the family of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> pilot -LRB- Capt. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Lorence </PERSON>, whose plane was shot down during the failed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> barbaric and savage attack on <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Benghazi </LOCATION> ... to take possession of his body which will be handed through the pope -LRB- of the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> -RRB-, especially since this occasion coincides with the end of the rule of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, the ` murderer of children,''' the <ORGANIZATION> JANA </ORGANIZATION> dispatch said. It said he made the comments to a group of Arab Christians. At the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>, deputy spokesman <PERSON> Giovanni </PERSON> <PERSON> D'ercole </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> had no immediate comment. After the 1986 raids, diplomats in <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> said <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> was demanding a ransom or concessions from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> before returning the airman's body. Three months after the attack, Libyan television showed pictures of a body it said was <PERSON> Lorence </PERSON>. Western witnesses reported seeing an F-111 crash into the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> soon after being hit, apparently by a missile, during the raid on <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION>. Relations between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> have been more strained than usual lately. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has charged <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> has constructed a plant to produce chemical weapons, and has said <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> was talking with its allies about a possible attack on the facility. <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> has claimed the plant produces pharmaceuticals.

 One thousand homeless people sleeping in chilly Skid Row doorways and on grimy sidewalks were awakened in the middle of the night by police, only to find the officers were bearing blankets instead of billy clubs. The officers were among the host of Americans playing <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Claus </LOCATION> at Christmastime, including a cigar-puffing <ORGANIZATION> Mercedes-Benz </ORGANIZATION> driver who passed out thousands of dollars to Skid Row denizens here and a man who bailed eight prisoners out of a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state jail. <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> police Capt. <PERSON> Carley </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> bought special waterproof, insulating blankets with $ 240 of his own money, then passed them out early Friday to the street dwellers, many of whom had little more than strips of cardboard to protect them. `` I was hoping I could keep some people warm for the holidays and make Christmas a little better for them,'' said <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, who runs the Police Department's training academy. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said he staged the giveaway in the middle of the night to make sure the blankets got to those who really needed them and to avoid the news media. `` I did n't want it to be any big deal, just a concerned citizen in street clothes doing something on his own time,'' he said. Later Friday in Skid Row, a hoard of homeless people were handed $ 10 bills by a self-styled <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> puffing a stogie, driving a <ORGANIZATION> Mercedes-Benz </ORGANIZATION> and wearing a bright red three-piece suit and a crimson fedora. The giveaway at the Midnight Mission came a day after the seventh annual visit there by a secretive philanthropist known as the <ORGANIZATION> Cadillac </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Santa </ORGANIZATION>, who also hands out cash. `` The guy in the Mercedes said he read about the <ORGANIZATION> Cadillac </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Santa </ORGANIZATION> and thought he could do better,'' said mission spokesman <PERSON> Clancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Imislund </PERSON>. However, the Cadillac-driving benefactor spent about twice as much as the $ 3,000 or so his imitator handed out, <PERSON> Imislund </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Imislund </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Mercedes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Santa </ORGANIZATION>'s red suit, red tie and red fedora were `` the most God-awful getup you could imagine, but his heart was in the right place and nobody cared what he was wearing. `` He was ho-ho-hoing like nobody's business and just like the other one, would n't reveal who he is,'' the spokesman said. In <LOCATION> Manhasset </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, just east of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Sal </PERSON> <PERSON> Miglio </PERSON> spent $ 2,000 to bail out seven women and one man who would otherwise have spent Christmas in the <LOCATION> Nassau </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Jail and gave them a choice of toys to bring home to their children. `` To be in jail just because you ca n't make bail of a couple of hundred dollars just does n't make sense,'' said <PERSON> Miglio </PERSON>, a 55-year-old developer playing Good Samaritan for the 14th year in a row. The prisoners were chosen through interviews with <PERSON> Miglio </PERSON> and by recommendations from jail workers, counselors and police. The crimes involved are usually petty larceny, trespassing or shoplifting, said Sheriff <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Jablonsky </PERSON>. At the <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> State Prison in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, inmates collected $ 1,700 to buy more than 1,000 Christmas toys for needy children in hospitals and elsewhere in town. `` We're saying, ` Just because we're here, that does n't mean we do n't have a heart,''' said inmate <PERSON> Billy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hicks </PERSON>, who is chairman of the toy project. The prisoners raised the money through donations and by collecting aluminium cans for sale at a recycling site, said <PERSON> Hicks </PERSON>. `` In some way, I would say that just about every one of the 1,600 or so men in the prison population helped with the project,'' he said. `` We've been working on this since about July.''

 A leader of the governing <ORGANIZATION> Jatiya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> was fatally shot in a resort town by a suspected Buddhist Chakma rebel, officials said today. <PERSON> Shantimay </PERSON> <PERSON> Dewan </PERSON>, 62, was shot by a lone gunman in a crowded bazaar in <LOCATION> Rangamati </LOCATION> on Wednesday and died Friday, doctors at a military hospital said when contacted by telephone. <PERSON> Dewan </PERSON> had been helping the government in peace talks with the Chakma rebels. He was the chairman of the <LOCATION> Rangamati </LOCATION> subdistrict council, the local adminstrative body. Police, speaking on condition of anonymity, said they thought hardcore rebels who oppose the peace talks were behind the attack. The tribal rebels have been campaigning for a separate state in the <LOCATION> Chittagong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tracts </LOCATION>, which adjoin the Indian states of <LOCATION> Tripura </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mizoram </LOCATION>. The rebels claim their cultural identity has been eroded by Moslem settlers. About 90 percent of <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>'s 110 million people are Moslems. The government says at least 2,000 armed rebels operate in the region, organizing hit-and-run attacks against army patrols and Moslem settlers. At least 4,000 people have been killed in the fighting since 1974, three years after <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> became an independent nation. The government has been conducting peace talks with moderates among the rebels for two years. At least 50,000 Chakmas have fled to <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> to avoid violence, Indian officials say.

 A passenger train bound for <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> crashed into a bus packed with peasants, killing at least 45 people and injuring 67, national television reported today. The accident, in northeastern <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Liaoning </LOCATION> province, occurred Friday at about 8 p.m., the news program said.

The Dandong-to-Beijing train crashed into the bus, crushing the vehicle, the report said. The locomotive also left the track and overturned. The TV showed a row of bodies and said many of the injured were in critical condition. It said police were investigating the cause of the accident. The report did not specify whether all the dead were from the bus. The report also showed the bus, which was mangled almost beyond recognition. Train service was restored to the line this morning, the report said.

 <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s executive committee gathered today for a meeting to discuss forming a provisional government for the newly declared independent Palestinian state. The closed-door meeting was scheduled amid growing opposition by radical Palestinian factions and some figures within the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> to <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s recent peace initiative. The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chairman has explicitly recognized <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and renounced terrorism. <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> officials said <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> met with senior aides in the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> capital before the meeting. Sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said the 15-member committee will discuss last week's talks between the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, efforts to convene an international <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace conference, and the formation of the provisional Palestinian government. The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chief in <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Azzam </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Ahmad </PERSON>, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> on Friday that the executive committee will also review the year-old <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> uprising in the Israeli-occupied territories and `` ways of escalating resistance to the occupation forces.'' The sources said the provisional government might not be named during the meeting of the executive committee because `` further consultations may be needed.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s parliament-in-exile, declared the Palestinian state at a meeting last month. Scores of countries have recognized the still-symbolic Palestinian state. <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> officials said that while <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> is in <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>, he will lay the cornerstone of a Palestinian embassy building in the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> capital. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> arrived in <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> late Friday after flying from <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>, where he met with <PERSON> Pope </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> II and with <LOCATION> Italian </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Ciriaco </PERSON> <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Mita </PERSON> and Foreign Minister <PERSON> Giulio </PERSON> <PERSON> Andreotti </PERSON>.

 A 10,000-gallon propane truck burst into a fireball and blasted off `` like an unguided missile,'' smashing into a house 125 yards away, killing two people inside and five motorists, authorities said. The tanker skidded on an interstate exit ramp near downtown Friday morning, hit a wall and exploded, authorities said. An eighth person, the driver of an 18-wheel truck, was killed after plowing into a traffic jam caused by the wreck. Ten other people were injured, including <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Malone </PERSON>, 57, who was burned in another home and was listed in critical condition today at the Regional Medical Center. The huge fireball destroyed six cars and damaged half a dozen houses in addition to the duplex crushed by the tanker truck, officials said. Investigators from the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> were to inspect the scene today, said agency spokesman <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Benson </PERSON>. The truck crashed on Interstate 240, rupturing its tank and releasing liquid propane that turned into a gaseous cloud as it escaped. A spark apparently triggered the explosion, authorities said. `` All of a sudden everything was on fire,'' said <PERSON> Dorothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hettinger </PERSON>, who lives next door to the wood-frame duplex. `` It was like an earthquake. My whole house was shaking.'' `` The whole sky was white, just lit up,'' said <PERSON> Gaines </PERSON> <PERSON> Tennison </PERSON>, manager of a nearby sheet metal plant. `` You could feel the heat inside the building.'' The victims had little chance to escape the flames, said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, a deputy fire chief at the scene. `` There was a huge fireball, maybe 700 to 800 feet,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. `` It engulfed three or four cars.'' `` I heard the explosion and saw the tanker flying through the air. It fell on the house and just blew up,'' said witness <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>. `` It was like an unguided missile,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Stonecipher </PERSON>, a city fire marshal. Witnesses said the tanker skidded on the 25-mph ramp, according to fire Capt. <PERSON> Benny </PERSON> <PERSON> McDow </PERSON>. The surface of the heavily used ramp onto Interstate 40 was dry. `` He was trying to exit and lost control and hit a retaining wall,'' <PERSON> McDow </PERSON> said. `` That exit there is short. It's one of those tight turns.'' The tanker remained mostly intact, but one end was blown out like a spent rocket. The burned-out hulks of cars were left scattered along I-240 and blackened a quarter-mile of grassy shoulder. A fender from the truck wound up in a tree, and a truck axle with four wheels attached ended up in the kitchen of <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Edgeston </PERSON>'s house two doors from the destroyed duplex. `` I did n't know the wheels were in there until I got back from the hospital,'' said <PERSON> Edgeston </PERSON>, who suffered a cut head but was not seriously hurt. Some of the dead were so badly burned they had to be identified through dental records, <PERSON> Stonecipher </PERSON> said. The dead included <PERSON> Shelanda </PERSON> <PERSON> Towles </PERSON>, a 10-year-old girl in one apartment in the duplex, and <PERSON> Iva </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubesheim </PERSON>, 87, who lived in another apartment, police said. Police Lt. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Krepela </PERSON> identified the other dead as the tanker's driver, <PERSON> Randall </PERSON> <PERSON> Benson </PERSON>, 29, of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, Ark.; drivers <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, 34, of <LOCATION> Brighton </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wardlow </PERSON>, 40, of <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>; <PERSON> Tina </PERSON> <PERSON> Wiles </PERSON>, 30, and her passenger, mother-in-law <PERSON> Warner </PERSON> <PERSON> Wiles </PERSON>, 70, both of <LOCATION> Vicksburg </LOCATION>, Miss. The accident left traffic backed up miles north and south of <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>. Trucker <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON>, 29, of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Helena </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ark. </LOCATION>, was killed when his tractor-trailer slammed into the rear of a car tied up in a traffic jam on I-240, said Patrolman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenland </PERSON>. Eleven people were taken to hospitals, officials said. Six were admitted, including the elderly woman who died later, and five were treated at emergency rooms and released.

 Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s bid to reform the tax system today cleared its last hurdle when the upper house of parliament passed the measures after 24 hours of delaying tactics by opposition parties. The new laws give <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> a 3 percent sales tax and reduce its heavy reliance on direct taxes by cutting corporate and upper-level income taxes. The legislation is to take effect April 1. Opposition parties introduced censure motions against <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> and four other government officials Friday afternoon and then shuffled to the podium at a snail's pace to delay voting. The tactics carried parliament through its first overnight session in 13 years. Opposition parties have blocked previous attempts by other premiers to overhaul the tax system, which was drafted by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> occupation authorities in the lean years after <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s defeat in World War II. Voting on the tax bills took place more than 24 hours after the censure motions were introduced. Legislators from the <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> Socialist and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> Communist parties left the chamber in a show of protest, and the bills were quickly approved by the majority <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION>. Since the <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> administration formally submitted the tax reform package to <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> in July, opposition legislators led by the <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> have boycotted sessions, demanding the government first fully investigate a high-level stock-trading scandal. The scandal, involving <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> and other top officials who profited from questionable sales of unlisted stocks bought at bargain prices, has led to the resignations of politicians, business leaders and media executives, including Finance Minister <PERSON> Kiichi </PERSON> <PERSON> Miyazawa </PERSON>, who stepped down on Dec. 9. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> took over the finance portfolio then. <PERSON> Tatsuo </PERSON> <PERSON> Murayama </PERSON> was one of the chief architects of the tax reform package. A former <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> bureaucrat, he is a considered a tax specialist and played a leading role in the <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s tax review committee, which he has chaired since 1985. The <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and local business groups on Friday protested the sales tax at a rally in <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s hometown. About 100 people shouting `` Destroy the tax bill'' and calling for the resignation of the Cabinet marched near the <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> family's sake brewery in <LOCATION> Kakeai-cho </LOCATION> in western <LOCATION> Shimane </LOCATION> prefecture, organizer <PERSON> Jiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Wada </PERSON> said. A study by the <ORGANIZATION> Shimouma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Consumers </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cooperative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> consumers' group, says that under the new tax plan, a typical four-member household with an annual income of $ 53,225 will pay $ 1,305 less in income and residents' taxes, but the new sales tax will cost it an additional $ 500.

 Americans who lost loved ones on <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> flight 103 visited the disaster site today, and police questioned whether more than 100 bodies still missing will ever be found. American <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Horgan </PERSON> said he had been out across the search area near this Scottish village this morning. `` I think you feel better once you actually see the site for yourself,'' said <PERSON> Horgan </PERSON>, who spoke at a news conference on condition that his hometown and details about his relative aboard the flight were not disclosed. He said he came to <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION> `` first and foremost to assist in the identification process of the bodies, and for our personal need to be near our loved one.'' As more than 600 police, troops and rescue workers combed <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION> and a wide area of the surrounding countryside for the third day today, police said there would be no halt for Christmas. `` Nothing will change over Christmas,'' said police spokesman <PERSON> Angus </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>. `` The search will go on and on. There are no plans at all to scale down the search operation.'' But it was uncertain whether the missing bodies would be found. `` We will not be able to answer that question for many days,'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said Friday night after the second full day of searching. Bodies of 155 people, killed Wednesday when a <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 slammed into the village of <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION>, have been placed in two temporary mortuaries. But the approximately 20 relatives who have arrived in <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION> have been unable to see any of the bodies because none has been positively identified. <PERSON> Horgan </PERSON> said experts were `` using comparative information from bodies they have found'' to try to identify them. `` Any little piece of information, whether it be clothing, articles, anything at all, would definitely help the process come to a speedy conclusion,'' <PERSON> Horgan </PERSON> said. Asked about the mental state of the relatives who flew to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, he said: `` You run quite a gamut of emotions _ grief, loss, frustration, anger.'' The anger, he said, was related to conjectures about the cause of the disaster. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> McMenamay </PERSON>, the local director of social work, said that increasing numbers of relatives were arriving in <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION> without advance notice. As soon as relatives made contact with local authorities, he said, they were provided with a counselor. `` Everybody's been wonderful,'' <PERSON> Horgan </PERSON> said. `` Everybody's doing a great job.'' Pan Am says 258 people were aboard the flight to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, and police are looking for about 20 people on the ground who have been missing since the crash. Six hundred people are participating in the search, backed by helicopters and dogs trained to seek bodies. Heavy equipment was brought in to help move large pieces of wreckage. One body was found Friday where the wreckage carved a 20-foot-deep furrow into sticky red clay and obliterated four houses. The explosion, which witnesses said created a 300-foot fireball, turned much of the 747 into shrapnel that tore holes in roofs and windows more than 100 yards away. Bits of debris were strewn across the devastated <PERSON> Sherwood </PERSON> <PERSON> Crescent </PERSON> street. A chunk 10 feet long was knifed into a lawn, but most other pieces were much smaller. `` On the other end in the countryside, part of the area being searched is very difficult bogland _ so you have natural difficulties and disaster-made difficulties,'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said. The main search area extends 15 miles east of <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION> in the rolling countryside of southwestern <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>. Police reduced their list of missing villagers from 22 to 20. One person whose car was caught in the inferno had been treated for injuries and released Wednesday night, and the other was found to be already on the list of missing. `` First, you search for the living, then you are searching for the dead, then for property, evidence, bits of airplane. These searches will go on and on and on,'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said. He said as many as 30 relatives of the victims had visited <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION> and had been briefed by police. He offered no details about the visits. Police were not discouraging relatives from coming, <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said, but he added: `` As a police officer and a person, I would say <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION> and the site of the terrible tragedy is perhaps not the place you should be visiting at this point _ and I say that on humanitarian grounds.''

<TEXT>
 The streets of <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION> were nearly deserted today as hundreds of <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers set up checkpoints to prevent Christmas violence. As Christmas eve began in the biblical town, the bishop of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> entered the Church of the Nativity, which marks the site where the Bible says <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> was born, amid the smoke of incense and a crowd of Israeli security men. The bishop, <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Sabbah </PERSON>, was greeted in rain-drenched <LOCATION> Manger </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> by the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> military governor of <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION>, Lt. Col. <PERSON> Shaltiel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lavy </PERSON>, and the city's <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> mayor, <PERSON> Elias </PERSON> <PERSON> Freij </PERSON>. Christian pilgrims seemed to be outnumbered by hundreds of <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> police and troops and dozens of journalists as <PERSON> Sabbah </PERSON> was greeted under a tradition that goes back to when the region was governed by British and Turkish rulers. <PERSON> Sabbah </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> patriarch, was led into the church in a procession headed by the traditional Moslem guides in red fezzes banging large canes on the ancient stones outside the church. Holy water was sprinkeld at the door of the church as <PERSON> Sabbah </PERSON> entered, surrounded by other church officials and altar boys. Israeli police formed a path holding hands to keep back journalists and others trying to get a glimpse of <PERSON> Sabbah </PERSON> in his red robe. <PERSON> Freij </PERSON> said that despite the sparse number of tourists during the day he expected that <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catherine </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, next to the Church of the Nativity and where midnight Mass will be said, would be full of pilgrims by evening. Asked about his message to the world on Christmas eve, <PERSON> Freij </PERSON> said: `` We say to God on the highest, peace on earth. My message is that we want peace with our <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> neighbors so both Arabs and Jews can live in peace and security as good friends, as free people, as equal people.'' Only one coffee stand was open in Manger Square. The other restaurants and tourist shops closed because of a strike declared by the PLO-backed leaders of the year-old uprising against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s occupation Security was tight around Manger Square. Anyone wanting to enter had to pass through metal detectors and be searched by Israeli security men. The Rev. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Doyle </PERSON>, a Franciscan priest from a nearby ecumenical research center, said he thought the security might discourage Palestinian Christians from attending midnight Mass. Many Arab Christians have said they will not attend Mass because of the strike. Leaders of the Palestinian uprising have asked <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> <PERSON> Arabs </PERSON> to boycott Mass to show their solidarity with the more than 330 people who have been killed during the rebellion. Fourteen Israelis also have been slain. `` We will punish everybody who leaves his house,'' said a slogan painted in red on one town wall. `` Let's make this day a mourning day for our martyrs'' said another, which was signed by the pro-PLO underground leadership. <PERSON> Freij </PERSON> and other city officials decided to cancel a traditional parade by Boy Scouts during the evening ceremonies in sympathy with the uprising. `` This is Christmas, but there will be no celebration or decorations and the Christmas trees will not be put up,'' <PERSON> Freij </PERSON> said on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio. `` The whole mood of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> is one of anger, sorrow, frustration and anxiety,'' he said. <PERSON> Doyle </PERSON> was asked if he thought the cancellation of festivities was a good idea on Christmas eve. `` I think they are right on target,'' said the Philadelphia-born priest. `` There is a memory to celebrate, but the present reality is very depressing.'' <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> Holladay </PERSON>, a visitor from <LOCATION> Wheelock </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vt. </LOCATION>, said she thought the heavy media and security presence interfered with the holiday spirit. `` I think the situation here has a numbing effect on Christmas,'' she said. `` All I see now are TV people and soldiers.'' In <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, 25 miles north of <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION>, a 21-year-old <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> man who was shot in the head by soldiers during a demonstration last week died of his wounds. A 55-year-old man from the nearby village of <LOCATION> Ijah </LOCATION> was shot in the left leg during a demonstration today. In the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, stores were shut and the army closed three schools after students set up rock barricades in the street and pelted soldiers with stones. A 15-year-old boy from <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Jebaliya </LOCATION> refugee camp was shot in the right leg after a clash with troops. He was taken to <PERSON> Ahli </PERSON> <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> hospital and discharged after the bullet was removed.

<TEXT>
 The southern province of <LOCATION> Guangdong </LOCATION> has held communist <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s first civil service examination, and 11,000 of the 120,000 applicants were selected for government employment, a report said today. The examination in September was reminiscent of the system used in imperial <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, where civil servants also were selected through tests. In present-day <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, however, the functions of <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> and government officials often overlap, and political connections frequently play a role in obtaining jobs and promotions. Last year, <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Zhao </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziyang </PERSON> proposed a civil service system, suggesting government employees not engaged in political work should obtain jobs on the basis of an examination, and wages and promotions should depend on merit. `` The idea of giving priority to seniority and other worn-out concepts that stifle people's initiative and creativity should be eradicated,'' he said. The <LOCATION> Guangdong </LOCATION> examination was `` a prelude to the civil service system,'' said the independent <PERSON> Ming </PERSON> <PERSON> Pao </PERSON> newspaper, quoting the pro-government <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. The examination was adminstered to 120,000 people in an `` open, fair and competitive'' manner, the report said. About 11,000 applicants passed the examination, including workers, high school and university graduates, and 3,000 people from rural areas, the report said. It did not give a breakdown of participants by age or sex. The new employees will work in provincial departments, including security, courts, finance and revenue, the report said.

 Armed men landed a helicopter in the central yard of a Colombian prison, fired at guards and flew away with at least five inmates connected to cocaine gangs, police said today. <PERSON> Leonel </PERSON> <PERSON> Cruz </PERSON> <PERSON> Chaparro </PERSON>, warden at the <LOCATION> Bellavista </LOCATION> prison, said the raid occurred Friday as about 600 inmates and their families were celebrating Christmas in the prison yard. The pilot, identified as <PERSON> Nestor </PERSON> <PERSON> Morales </PERSON>, was injured and arrested minutes later as he landed alone at the <LOCATION> Olaya </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Herrera </LOCATION> airport in this city 170 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION>. Police launched a manhunt for the fugitives, who were apparently dropped off somewhere between the prison and the airport, officials said. Nobody was injured on the ground, <PERSON> Cruz </PERSON> <PERSON> Chaparro </PERSON> said. Police said the helicopter, stolen from the private company <PERSON> Helicol </PERSON>, landed at the yard, picked up at least five inmates and flew away. The fugitives included two members of the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nachos </ORGANIZATION> gang, a Colombian group that has been linked to killings ordered by the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cartel, which is believed responsible for most of the cocaine smuggled into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.

 An oil tanker with 34 men aboard broke its mooring and drifted for five hours in the stormy <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> today before two tugboats chased it down and began towing it back to <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>. The tugboats attached lines to the tanker about 200 miles east of the port of <LOCATION> Dundee </LOCATION>, a coast guard spokesman in <LOCATION> Aberdeen </LOCATION> said. The tanker's engines were removed when it was permanently moored in the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> as a storage facility where smaller tankers picked up oil, so it drifted in strong winds and turbulent seas. The vessel was moored at a loading point in the Fulmar oil field when it broke from its mooring about 5:30 a.m. in 15-foot waves and 60 mph winds and began drifting to the southeast, said the spokesman, who demanded anonymity.

 Tornadoes swept across a section of central <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> early today, killing at least one person, injuring 15 others and destroying several homes, authorities said.

<TEXT>
 An uprising by inmates who were denied Christmas pardons was crushed by police, but 22 people, including the prison warden, died in gunfights between authorities and prisoners, officials said today. The incident began Thursday at the <PERSON> Venustiano </PERSON> <PERSON> Carranza </PERSON> penitentiary in <LOCATION> Nayarit </LOCATION> state, when about six inmates took 12 to 14 prison employees hostage. It ended about 11 p.m. Friday when two commando teams stormed the prison. `` The total counted this morning is 22 dead and five or maybe six people seriously injured. Four, including the penitentiary director, were killed before special forces stormed the place. Eighteen were killed when the commandos stormed the place,'' a police officer who demanded anonymity. He did n't break the death toll down into prisoners and employees. Another officer, <PERSON> Sergio </PERSON> <PERSON> Anzaldo </PERSON>, said: `` There was a fierce gunfight lasting about 15 minutes before the special forces could quell the mutiny.'' <PERSON> Anzaldo </PERSON>, who was the duty officer when the commandos attacked, said everything was quiet in the penitentiary today. `` The guard has been doubled and reinforced with special elements,'' he said in a telephone interview. The chain of events in <LOCATION> Tepic </LOCATION>, 500 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, began when about six inmates who had sought appointments with the warden arrived at his prison office Thursday, said <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Flores </PERSON>, a state government spokesman. At the same time, two well-dressed visitors posing as lawyers approached the building, according to the spokesman. The men posing as attorneys entered the prison without being searched, then took out guns, <PERSON> Flores </PERSON> said. It was not immediately clear who started the shooting, which <PERSON> Flores </PERSON> said ended in three deaths. The dead included warden <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Alvarado </PERSON>, 31, who bled to death from a leg wound, a security guard, and an inmate _ the brother of the apparent leader of the assault _ officials said. The prisoners, angry that they were denied Christmas pardons for good behavior, seized hostages, and <PERSON> Flores </PERSON> said about 200 soldiers, police and guards surrounded the penitentiary. As dusk fell Friday, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s Zorro and Escorpion commando teams sprayed tear gas and rushed the prison, causing what <PERSON> Flores </PERSON> called a `` very violent confrontation.'' The ensuing violence more people dead, including the head of the Zorro commando team, he said. Three hours later, the commandos staged a second raid, which killed more people and ended up freeing the hostages, he said. On Friday the prisoners demanded an armored car and high-powered firearms with the apparent intention of leaving the place, then canceled the demand. Except for the few inmates holding hostages in the administrative offices, the rest of the prison's 1,200 inmates remained under control, <PERSON> Flores </PERSON> said. He said the mutinous prisoners included people serving time on drug charges. <PERSON> Flores </PERSON> said the state attorney general, <PERSON> Rodolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Leon </PERSON>, tried to talk the mutineers _ who had guns, knives and clubs _ out of further violence. He said the inmates appeared to be uncertain of what they wanted to do.

 Premier <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON>, considered a stodgy technocrat, has suddenly been thrust into the public eye during the disaster caused by the Armenian earthquake. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s dynamic leader, President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, has retreated into an unusual silence and been absent from public view after making a brief trip to <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> went to <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> the morning after the Dec. 7 earthquake. Until he returned to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> last week, <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> received heavy coverage in the state-run media doing the things Soviets have come to expect from the more voluble <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> directed the machinery of government in full view of TV cameras, hugged homeless Armenians and met crowds on street corners. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, by contrast, rushed home from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, spent a stormy weekend in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> and has not been seen in public since Dec. 11. There were no indications that <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON>'s prominence and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s absence signaled any realignment in the Kremlin or that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> was ill. But it was suddenly <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> who represented the Kremlin throughout the burst of publicity given by the Soviet media to the earthquake. The careers of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> have been linked. <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> was appointed to the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Politburo </ORGANIZATION> in April 1985, a month after <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> took power. He was assigned to head the Soviet government in September 1985, and is considered an important player in <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s economic reform plans. But the earthquake _ and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s absence _ gave the 59-year-old <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> an opportunity to shed a colorless image and gain daily television exposure. `` Thank you, thank you, thank you,'' Armenians called to <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> in the earthquake-damaged city of <LOCATION> Kirovakan </LOCATION>. `` People are very satisfied,'' said an elderly woman, pressing <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON>'s hands. <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> responded to people with smiles and promises of help. `` He's gotten a high profile, but whether it works to his advantage, I do n't know,'' said one diplomat who spoke on condition of anonymity. That will depend on how <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON>'s work in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> is perceived by other <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> leaders, he said. <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> acknowledged widespread reports of disorganization in the relief efforts during a news conference in the Armenian capital <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> on Dec. 12. But he said after a bad start the organization had begun to improve. In the spirit of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policy of glasnost, or greater openness, <PERSON> Ryzhkov </PERSON> directly answered all the questions put to him by foreign and Soviet reporters in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>. He showed little emotion in his answers. But when reporters asked him about ethnic troubles between Armenians and Azerbaijanis over control of the <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> region, he began jabbing the air with his hand and said, `` We do n't understand these people. While the whole country is helping them, they are raising these questions. We think the Armenian people must reject them.'' It was the same issue that caused <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> to show his anger on Soviet television. Asked about allegations by Armenian activists that Soviet officials planned to move orphaned Armenians out of the earthquake area and repopulate it with Russians, he responded, `` What kind of morals do those people have?'' `` They do n't need <LOCATION> Karabakh </LOCATION>. They are waging a battle for power, and they must be stopped,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said. Many Armenians are upset with <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> for refusing to give in to their demands to annex Nagorno-Karabakh from <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s absence from public view was `` normal for the week after the quake, but this week it's a little more difficult to explain,'' said the foreign diplomat. But <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has not missed any events that could be considered important enough to demand his presence, and the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> has continued issuing documents over <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s name. The <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency said <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> sent a message of condolence to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> after the crash of a <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> jet in <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> on Wednesday.

 A graffiti artist's distinctive signature became his downfall when police matched the one he was writing on a <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> building with one that appeared on nearly 80 subway cars, authorities said. Transit police saw the teen-ager writing graffiti on the building and were able to charge him with defacing the subway cars because the graffiti signatures, or `` tags,'' matched, said <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Leary </PERSON>, a Transit police spokesman. <PERSON> Todd </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> James </PERSON>, 19, was charged with second-degree criminal mischief, first-degree criminal tampering, both felonies, and a misdemeanor, third-degree criminal trespass, <PERSON> O'Leary </PERSON> said Friday. If convicted, <PERSON> James </PERSON> faces four to seven years in prison on each felony count. The officers saw <PERSON> James </PERSON> spraying the letters <ORGANIZATION> REAS </ORGANIZATION> on the building, <PERSON> O'Leary </PERSON> said. Last weekend, 160 subway cars were spraypainted, nearly half of them with the letters <ORGANIZATION> REAS </ORGANIZATION>. `` This can be in the future, if the prosecution is successful, a very valuable tool in the war against vandalism,'' <PERSON> O'Leary </PERSON> said. `` It's the first time the district attorney's office was able to prosecute without seeing him being in the act of graffiti-ing the property. `` A tag to a graffiti vandal is like a signature,'' he said. `` The way you sign your paycheck is the way a graffiti vandal writes his or her name on public property.''

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> leaders, faced with growing dissension among radical factions, met Saturday to discuss forming a government for an independent Palestinian state and map the next move in crucial talks with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Most of the 15 members of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s governing body attended the meeting at chief <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s home outside <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> officials said. The meeting followed growing opposition by radical Palestinian factions and some figures within the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> to <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s stated recognition of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and renunciation of terrorism. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials insisted on such statements before they would deal with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Azzam </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> representative in <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>, said the committee will discuss the Dec. 16 talks opened in <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION> with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and map out the future Palestinian moves in the dialogue. The talks were the first direct contact between the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> in 13 years. If sustained, the talks could lead to a breakthrough in the tortuous quest to end the 40-year-old Arab-Israeli conflict. <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> gave no details, but stressed the committee will explore `` all the possible ways to advance the constructive dialogue.'' The committee also is discussing efforts for international <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace conference and the formation of a provisional government for the independent Palestinian state declared by the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> last month <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> officials said earlier that the provisional government might not actually be named during the committee meeting because `` further consultations may be needed.'' Sixty-nine countries have recognized the still-symbolic Palestinian state. While in <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> will lay the cornerstone of a Palestinian embassy, <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> officials said. <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> said the committee also will review the yearlong <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> uprising against Israeli rule in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> and `` ways of escalating resistance to the occupation forces.'' At least 334 Palestinians and 14 Israelis have died. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> arrived in <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> late Friday after flying from <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>, where he met earlier with <PERSON> Pope </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> II and Italian leaders. <PERSON> Ahmed </PERSON> indicated that the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> might call for an Arab summit to press for an international peace conference under <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> auspices. It is not clear how extensive opposition within the executive committee is to <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s moves. One member, <PERSON> Mustafa </PERSON> <PERSON> Zibri </PERSON>, deputy leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Marxist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Popular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> for the <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION>, attacked <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s peace initiative. On Monday, <PERSON> Zibri </PERSON> declared that <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s recognition of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and renunciation of terrorism `` were only <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s personal opinion and are incompatible'' with resolutions passed by the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> He warned: `` We will continue to exercise our legitimate rights in struggling against the occupation by all means available, including armed struggle.'' Palestinian dissidents based in <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> warned Tuesday they will continue `` the armed struggle'' against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to torpedo his peace moves and will seek to oust him from <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> leadership. The Americans have said they will break off the dialogue with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> if the movement is found to have carried out terrorist attacks. In <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, newspapers reported Saturday that the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> and the Shiite Moslem Amal militia have reached a new peace pact to end their bloody 3-year conflict. The papers published the pact, the sixth since 1985, and there was widespread doubt whether the accord would hold. More than 3,000 people have been killed and 10,000 wounded since Amal moved against Palestinian refugee camps to prevent <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> from rebuilding a power base in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> destroyed <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> outposts in a 1982 invasion. Newspapers said the new pact provides for a disengagement of forces and the removal of barricades to enforce a cease-fire between Amal and the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> around <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION>, provincial capital of south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Amal has an estimated 10,000 armed militiamen. The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> has 4,500 guerrillas based in the <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION> region, 25 miles south of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>.

 Four Colombian men were arrested after police made an unusual holiday haul _ a 12-figure nativity scene filled with pressed cocaine worth $ 2 million. Police said Saturday that drug agents had discovered 6.6 pounds of the drug inside figures including the infant <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON>, the <PERSON> Virgin </PERSON> <PERSON> Mary </PERSON>, the three Kings and little lambs.

<HEAD>Loose Oil Storage Vessel Drifts 13 Miles</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ABERDEEN, Scotland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A giant oil storage vessel broke its mooring and drifted for 13 miles on Saturday, forcing a shutdown of more than 10 percent of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> oil production, coast guard and oil company officials said. Two tugboats sent to the scene, about 200 miles east of the Scottish port of <ORGANIZATION> Dundee </ORGANIZATION>, managed to attach lines to the tanker and brought the vessel under control after five hours, said the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rescue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coordination </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Aberdeen </LOCATION>. The converted 200,000-ton tanker with 34 men on board was being towed by the tugs, the Oil Chancellor and the <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Challenger </ORGANIZATION>, the coast guard said. Its destination was not immediately known. The vessel is a tanker modified to act as a fixed, engineless floating storage tank. It has been permanently moored in <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> UK </ORGANIZATION>'s Fulmar oilfield, collecting oil from three fields and then loading the crude on to smaller tankers <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> UK </ORGANIZATION> said production from the three fields _ the Fulmar and neighboring <LOCATION> Auk </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Clyde </PERSON> platforms _ had been shut down automatically when the vessel broke free. The three fields have a combined daily production of 210,000 barrels of crude _ 10 to 12 percent of total output from the British sector of the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>, said a <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. He spoke on condition of anonymity. <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION> said production from the three fields would remain shut because they now had nowhere to send their oil. Crude oil from the three platforms normally flows by pipeline along the seabed and feeds into the vessel, known as a Floating Storage Unit. When the vessel broke free at about 5:30 a.m. in 15-foot seas and 60-knot winds, <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION> said it dragged its mooring installation with it. <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION> said a `` sizable'' amount of oil had been spotted in the area, but it was not known whether a serious leak had developed. When the system shut down automatically at the seabed, <ORGANIZATION> Shell </ORGANIZATION> said there were 370 cubic yards of oil in the pipeline beyond the shutdown point. Initially, there were fears the vessel would collide with other installations in the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>. With the vessel under tow, helicopters called out from <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> and northern <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> to evacuate the men if necessary were recalled.

<TEXT>
 For the first time in recent years, blacks are buying toys, sending Christmas cards and filling their holiday shopping bags without fear that they will be punished for breaking a boycott. But although some holiday traditions are making a comeback, others died during the years of unrest and Yuletide protest against apartheid. There is no Santa Claus in <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION>. `` We are the biggest store in <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION> but we do not have a Father Christmas here. We believe that would be something out of place. That is something that is confined to town -LRB- where whites live -RRB-,'' said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Gama </PERSON>, chief executive of the Black Chain supermarket. <PERSON> Gama </PERSON> said last year he did n't even offer Christmas items for sale. This year Christmas cards and inexpensive balls and small plastic guns are selling briskly. `` I think the people must be paying for the lost years in terms of enjoyment and excitement because this is the first normal Christmas where there is no tension from any quarter,'' <PERSON> Gama </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Claus </LOCATION> once was a part of <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION>'s holiday imagery, but since nationwide anti-government unrest broke out in 1984 there have been calls for a `` Black Christmas.'' The calls consisted of boycotts against shopping for Christmas presents and festive food, Christmas Eve blackouts in the townships, and memorial services for those detained under a state of emergency. The township of 2.5 million blacks outside <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> was a focal point of the unrest. People who worked in <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION> and bought goods there during the Christmas shopping period sometimes were attacked by youths when they disembarked from buses or trains. Sometimes boycott-breakers were beaten or killed. In 1986, the call went out for a Christmas Eve blackout in <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION> and monitors patrolled the township, knocking on doors if they saw any more light than a candle. There was no formal announcement that this year would be different, and not even the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has a definitive reason for the renewed holiday spirit. `` It is possible that the popular democratic movement has found other ways and methods to register their feelings about apartheid without making a public call for a boycott,'' said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Sebina </PERSON>, a spokesman for the guerrilla organization, in a statement from <LOCATION> Lusaka </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Zambia </LOCATION>. People detained without charge have been a major focus of the `` Black Christmas'' protests since a national emergency was declared in June 1986. The release of hundreds of detainees over the past few months may have defused some of the motives for protest, although hundreds, almost all of them black, still remain in custody without charge. One of them, journalist <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Sokutu </PERSON>, has been held without charge or trial for 30 months. Many Soweto residents go home for Christmas, and home is usually a homestead in a rural area. For many men and women, the long holiday period is the only time of the year they see their children, who are raised by grandmothers in tribal homelands because of lack of housing and school space in the urban townships. In <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>, meanwhile, the family of jailed black leader <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> arrived carrying presents and a cake for a Christmas visit. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Winnie </PERSON>, their daughter, <PERSON> Zinzi </PERSON>, and their three grandchildren planned an 80-minute visit Sunday with <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> at his suburban-style house on the grounds of the <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Vester </PERSON> <PERSON> Prison </PERSON>. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, leader of the <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, was moved to the house Dec. 7 after recuperating from tuberculosis at a <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> hospital. Under the new terms of <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>'s confinement, his family is allowed unlimited visits. However, Mrs. <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> has said the family will not accept any special privileges from the white-led government and will make only the standard prison visits of no more than 80 minutes. The government's decision to place <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON> in a prison staff house is seen as part of an effort to release the black leader in stages.

 <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanford </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, first and perhaps the only woman named to the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> cabinet, has the resume of a topnotch <ORGANIZATION> Ivy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> lawyer and the charm of a quintessential Southern belle. Her ability to disarm even the toughest critics has earned her widespread popularity on <LOCATION> Capital </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, even among many Democrats. And her reputation as an able government official appears to have weathered harsh evaluations of her <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration tenure as transportation secretary. `` She is a woman of great ability with many friends in both parties on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> that must confirm her Saturday she was named as labor secretary by President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. The choice left just one Cabinet spot open, that of energy secretary. Relentlessly cheerful, Mrs. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> is at age 52 half of what inside <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> likes to call a `` power couple.'' Her husband is <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Republican Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, who unsuccessfully sought his party's presidential nomination They have a Watergate apartment and a miniature schnauzer named `` Leader.'' Known as `` <PERSON> Liddy </PERSON>,'' a nickname she picked herself, Mrs. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> was born in <LOCATION> Salisbury </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, the only daughter of <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanford </PERSON>, a small-town florist, and <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Ella </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanford </PERSON>. Early on, she displayed a promising combination of brains and beauty. Growing up, she had ballet classes, horseback riding lessons and at 18, a debutante ball in <LOCATION> Raleigh </LOCATION>. At 20, she was student body president of the Women's College at <ORGANIZATION> Duke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and also May Queen. She graduated Phi Beta Kappa with a bachelor's degree in history from <ORGANIZATION> Duke </ORGANIZATION> in 1958 and went on to receive a master's degree in education and government from <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in 1960. In 1962 she was named beauty queen at a <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> naval base, although she later recalled: `` I was getting a little old for this sort of thing.'' She graduated from <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in 1965. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, her mother said, drew Mrs. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> `` like a magnet.'' She immersed herself for 20 years in the process of climbing the political ladder. In the process, she switched from Democrat to Independent to Republican. She made her way through the old <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Welfare </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> and President <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on Consumer Interests In 1976 she took a leave of absence from the <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> to campaign for her husband's vice presidential bid and in 1979, she quit the <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> two years before her term expired to help him run for president. Mrs. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> is generally credited with softening her husband's hatchet-man image, although she dismisses that, seeming to suggest he was always really a softy: `` He's sort of the way I always knew him. With no prior background in the transportation field, Mrs. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> was named in 1983 as President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s transportation secretary. She pushed for mandatory seat belt laws, tighter screening procedures in airports and more sophisticated anti-collision devices for airliners. But she was criticized in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for spending more time on press releases than real improvements. Critics contended she more often than not unveiled new regulatory procedures after the department had been pushed into it by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> or the courts. Critics also faulted her for approving a string of airline mergers that concentrated much of the airline industry into a half-dozen large carriers. In 1987, a trade journal called her DOT stewardship `` little more than a planned media event.'' And The <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Monthly headlined a cover story: `` Charming Her Way to the White House; air travel stinks, auto safety's a joke and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> still loves <PERSON> Liddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> stepped down a year ago to help her husband's presidential campaign, saying the move had nothing to do with the criticism and declaring she was glad to join him on the campaign trail after years of living `` like passing ships in the night. Sen. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> noted her new appointment with a combination of pride and humor. `` It looks like TV dinners for me again, but I'll still probably vote for her confirmation,'' he said.

 Nicaraguan refugees are arriving in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> at a pace reminiscent of the Mariel sealift in 1980, when 125,000 Cubans hit the shores over a five-month period. The scene in 1980: Some 700 Mariel Cubans were temporarily housed at the Orange Bowl before being moved to a `` tent city'' underneath an Interstate 95 overpass. At one point, as many as 1,200 Cubans crowded into 40 tents. Now <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Maduro </PERSON> <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Stadium </LOCATION>, the spring home of the <ORGANIZATION> Baltimore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orioles </ORGANIZATION>, has become the winter home of Nicaraguans who fled their war-torn Central American nation in hopes of a better life. Late this week, 275 Nicaraguans were housed at the stadium, with more arriving daily, many coming across from <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and traveling east. <PERSON> Conny </PERSON> <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>, secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Poor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nicaraguans </ORGANIZATION> in Exile, which is helping city workers run the shelter, estimated that number could nearly double by the end of the month. `` We are strapped to the max,'' said <PERSON> Bobby </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernal </PERSON>, administrative assistant to <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>'s manager and refugee coordinator. `` Immigration is a federal responsibility. But we ca n't turn our backs.'' About 70 percent of the 200 asylum applications received daily at the <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> office of the <ORGANIZATION> Immigration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Naturalization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> are from Nicaraguans, said <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> district director <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivkind </PERSON>. Some 35,000 to 40,000 Nicaraguans have applied here for asylum over the past year, he said. The flood can be attributed to the collapse of the economy as well as the foundering rebel movement against the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>. While the total has been spread out over a longer period, the impact of the refugees has been compared to the exodus of Cubans from the port of <LOCATION> Mariel </LOCATION> in the 1980 `` Freedom Flotilla.'' `` It's going to come to a point when we'll look at the federal government and say, ` When is it going to end? When can we see a slowdown in this problem?''' <PERSON> Bernal </PERSON> said. `` If the government does n't wish to curtail this, then provide us with some dollars.'' Prompted by a backlog of asylum applications in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Harlingen </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> plans to beef up review teams to process petitions, and it has been announced that Nicaraguans will no longer automatically receive authorization to work while their cases are pending. But the refugees at the stadium were lucky. They are expected to receive work permits within days, following a meeting between <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> City Manager <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> <PERSON> Odio </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> INS </ORGANIZATION> Commissioner <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Working papers. There's little else the refugees talk about in the bowels of the stadium, where they were moved recently from a three-room storefront in <LOCATION> Little </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION>. `` We have everything here _ food and clothes _ but we want to have a home and be able to work,'' said <PERSON> Ana </PERSON> <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Zepeda </PERSON>, who is seven months pregnant and came with her husband and three children, ages 2 to 5. `` We all say it would be the best Christmas if we could get work permits.'' The women and children are separated from the men, who sleep on the second floor in a space beneath the stadium's bleachers. The women are in a first-floor shower-locker room area that is lined wall-to-wall with cots and metal bunk beds piled high with blankets and clothes. The children play down the center aisle with donated toys. A fake, undecorated Christmas tree and a television are on a corner table. Donated food and clothing also has been evenly split with a varying number of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>'s homeless population, who are staying in another part of the stadium. But while the goods have poured in and volunteers are abundant, housing for the refugees remains a critical issue. Already, the refugee population has outgrown an empty city-owned building being renovated as a shelter.

<HEAD>Special Education Costs $3,555 Extra Per Child</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CHRISTOPHER CONNELL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Schools spent an extra $ 3,555 for each of the 4.4 million handicapped children receiving some form of special education in the 1985-86 academic year, according to a study prepared for the government. The total cost for special education students was $ 6,335 on average, or 2.3 times the $ 2,780 cost for regular classwork, the report said. About 11 percent of the nation's school children receive special education in some way. The new $ 1.8 million study, done by a private research and analysis firm, <ORGANIZATION> Decision </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, breaks down the special education costs by the different approaches used to teach children with handicaps, ranging from physical disabilities to mental disorders. It examined both `` resource programs,'' or those serving pupils for less than half of the regular 30-hour school week, and `` self-contained programs'' _ defined as those which occupied more than 15 hours per week. Looking only at what was spent on special education, the resource programs spent $ 2,463 per pupil versus $ 5,566 per pupil in the self-contained programs. But the schools also incurred regular education costs for these pupils _ the full regular cost of $ 2,780 for those in resource programs, and about half as much, $ 1,347, for those in self-contained programs. That boosted the total per pupil costs to $ 5,243 for those in resource programs and to $ 6,913 for those in self-contained programs, the study said. `` It's an erroneous comparison to say, ` If I had all the kids in resource programs, I could save a lot of money,''' said <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Decision </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and project director for the study. `` The difference is only about $ 1,700, not $ 3,000.'' The study, based on visits to 60 school districts in 18 states, also found average per pupil costs of: _ $ 4,750 for preschool special education programs, plus $ 973 in regular education costs for a total of $ 5,723. _ $ 29,108 for residential programs, plus $ 389 in regular education costs for a total of $ 29,497. Most special education pupils were enrolled in resource programs, and they spent 80 percent of their time in regular education. Fifteen percent of those in self-contained programs spent no time in regular education. The rest spent an average of 28 percent of their time in regular classes. The study said special education costs rose 10 percent after inflation between 1977-78 and 1985-86, versus a 4 percent increase for regular education. Instruction accounted for 63 percent of the special education costs, assessment 13 percent, support services 11 percent, related services 10 percent and transportation 5 percent. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said the percentages added to more than 100 percent because of rounding up. The average caseload for teachers in resource programs was 26 students. In self-contained programs, there was one teacher for every four hard-of-hearing students; one per five autistic or multihandicapped students; one per seven deaf or visually handicapped students; one per eight mentally retarded or orthopedically impaired students; one per nine speech impaired or seriously emotionally disturbed students, and one per 13 learning disabled students. Transportation was the most expensive related service provided handicapped students. Thirty percent needed special transportation services, at an average cost of $ 1,583. Assessment cost an average of $ 1,206, physical therapy $ 993, occupational therapy $ 918, psychological services $ 867, speech language pathology $ 648 and guidance and counseling $ 553. Federal dollars provided 5 percent of the local district's instructional budget for the handicapped, but 17 percent of their budget for support services <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> discussed the report in an interview and provided a set of tables prepared for a recent briefing for special education groups. The full report, `` <ORGANIZATION> Patterns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> in </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Special </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> _ </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, Delivery and Cost,'' will be available early next year.

 They call her the Lizard Lady. She can tell at a glance if a handbag is cobra or crocodile, python or plastic. Nor is she cowed by rawhide vs. <PERSON> Naugahyde </PERSON>, boa vs. bogus. As the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> inspector at <ORGANIZATION> Hartsfield </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlanta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airport </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Carson </PERSON> supervises the shipment of wild animals, checks fish bound for restaurants, sees that leather goods are properly imported and makes sure that endangered species or items made from them are not allowed into the country. If an item comes from an endangered species, such as the hawksbill turtle or white leopard, she does n't monkey around. The item is confiscated, and the worst offenders can receive up to a year in prison and a $ 20,000 fine. Some travelers who have their souvenirs taken away submit quietly. Others have `` made me glad I had a customs inspector standing next to me and that he was armed,'' Ms. <PERSON> Carson </PERSON> said. She rides herd on hunting trophies from an African safari being shipped to a taxidermist in <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, rare monkeys being exchanged by zoos for breeding, and <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> salmon headed for some of the Southeast's finest restaurants. For her territory _ the Southeast with the exception of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> _ Ms. <PERSON> Carson </PERSON> inspects products ranging from <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s smartest leather clothing and accessories to `` cheap junk, tanned so badly it will start to smell in a few weeks.'' A big day was the interception of 100 illegal elephant tusks. This day's haul, though, included cheap items sent from <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION> to an address in the <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> suburb of College Park. Seated on plastic trash bags spread on the floor of the <ORGANIZATION> KLM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dutch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> freight terminal, Ms. <PERSON> Carson </PERSON> cataloged and counted a growing pile of purses, wallets and briefcases made of various reptile hides. A glance told her whether it was cobra or monitor lizard. Some, however, were n't that easy. Her fingers probed the trim on a drawstring purse. `` It's fake,'' she finally said, grinning. `` It's trimmed in fake alligator.'' Fake is legal. But she confiscated 239 items that did n't have proper permits or were made from monitor lizards, whose skins can not be brought into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> under the Endangered Species Act. The rest of the shipment was either cowhide items or African garments colored with cheap vegetable dye. The clothing was possibly illegal because of import quotas for textiles, but that was a matter for the <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. Buried in a second shipment of cloth items and bags of shredded grass were two 12-foot python hides, two cobra skins, two antelope hides, five snakeskin handbags, three pairs of lizard shoes and the skin of a civet, a cat-like creature. The bags of confiscated goods made a pile in the back of the van with a `` Lizard Lady'' plate on the front. `` The international mechanics at <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> tagged me with that name when I first got here,'' Ms. <PERSON> Carson </PERSON> said. A college wildlife major and onetime zoo volunteer, Ms. <PERSON> Carson </PERSON> joined the Fish and <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> as a secretary. When the service decided to put an inspector at <ORGANIZATION> Hartsfield </ORGANIZATION> four years ago, `` I was the only one around with a biology background who wanted it.'' `` I like the -LRB- Lizard Lady -RRB- designation now,'' she said. `` It keeps me high profile. Customs, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, the airlines, they know who I am, that I am here. I'm sure I'm listed in some Rolodexes as Lizard Lady.''

 The women at the birthday party enjoyed watching a male stripper shuck his fake sheriff's deputy outfit, but police gave him a different reception on his way home. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Bateham </PERSON>, 27, was charged with impersonating a police officer. The charges were later dropped, but <PERSON> Bateham </PERSON> suffered a separated shoulder in a motorcycle accident prior to his arrest. The stripper started off his act Oct. 16 wearing a fake sheriff's deputy uniform with `` <LOCATION> Sarasota </LOCATION> Sheriff's Office'' patches on the arms, a mail-order `` County Mounty'' badge and a gun belt After performing at the birthday party, <PERSON> Bateham </PERSON> said he put a jacket over his uniform and was driving toward his girlfriend's house when a police car started following him He had an accident on a dead end road. `` When -LRB- the officers -RRB- walked up to me, I told them I was a dancer and it was a BB gun.

He has to try something official, like threaten to arrest somebody.

 Soviet holiday customs look a lot like American ones, but in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, the jolly man with the fluffy white beard and red suit rides in a taxi and few of the presents he brings run on batteries. Instead of standing in line at a shopping mall to sit on <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION>'s lap, many Soviet children get house calls from <ORGANIZATION> Ded </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Moroz </ORGANIZATION> _ Grandfather Frost _ and <PERSON> Snegurochka </PERSON>, a beautiful snow maiden dressed in white Five-year-old <PERSON> Olga </PERSON>'s eyes lit up as Ded <PERSON> Moroz </PERSON> and <PERSON> Snegurochka </PERSON> walked into her family's apartment Saturday morning. The couple sang, danced and told riddles with the little girl. Ded <PERSON> Moroz </PERSON> then opened his sack and pulled out a huge teddy bear, which <PERSON> Olga </PERSON>'s father had handed him secretly beforehand. `` It's so beautiful,'' said <PERSON> Olga </PERSON>, who was dressed in a powder-blue princess costume and wore a shiny tiara and a big light blue bow atop her head. Ded <PERSON> Moroz </PERSON> and <PERSON> Snegurochka </PERSON> wished the family happy New Year and trudged through the mounds of snow back to their hired yellow taxi. They had about 30 more stops before the day was through. `` I do n't feel like it's New Year's unless I dress up like this and visit little children,'' said <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> Krylov </PERSON>, 37, who has been playing Ded Moroz for nine years. `` Our -LRB- Soviet -RRB- children believe so much that <PERSON> Ded </PERSON> <PERSON> Moroz </PERSON> and <PERSON> Snegurochka </PERSON> are real,'' said <PERSON> Lyuda </PERSON> <PERSON> Golubgikova </PERSON>, 33, a six-year veteran <LOCATION> Snegurochka </LOCATION>. `` I love to see their eyes shine when we walk in.'' After the Bolshevik revolution in 1917, the primary winter holiday in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> switched from Christmas, celebrated Jan. 7 in the Russian Orthodox faith, to New Year's. <PERSON> Olga </PERSON>'s parents were among about 4,000 people who each paid a <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> business called <ORGANIZATION> Consumer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> about $ 9 to have the holiday couple bring New Year's greetings to their children between Dec. 24 and Jan. 5, said <PERSON> Tamara </PERSON> <PERSON> Korovina </PERSON>, who hired the cast of characters. People signed up for Ded <PERSON> Moroz </PERSON> house calls at Detsky Mir, the largest children's store in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, located in the center of <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. Soviets flock to <PERSON> Detsky </PERSON> Mir from across the nation and buy about 500,000 toys per day during the holiday season, said <PERSON> Garnik </PERSON> <PERSON> Oganesyan </PERSON>, director of commerce at the five-story store. <PERSON> Valentina </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON>, 31, went to <PERSON> Detsky </PERSON> Mir to pick up a toy for her 3-year-old son, but while shopping decided to order a visit from Ded <PERSON> Moroz </PERSON>. `` Andrusha will be so surprised! He has only seen Ded Moroz on greeting cards,'' she said. Mrs. <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> said she had no trouble finding the toy submarine her son had requested. All she had to do was fight the crowd at Detsky Mir _ which makes Christmas Eve at a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> department store look calm in comparison _ and wait in line for 30 minutes. Parents whose children asked for electronic or battery-operated toys were likely to be disappointed. <PERSON> Detsky </PERSON> Mir only had a few such toys, and as soon as they went on display they were snapped up, admitted <PERSON> Oganesyan </PERSON>. `` My 11-year-old son wants an electronic game, but I do n't think I'll be able to find it,'' said a Detsky Mir employee, who asked that her name not be used. She said Soviet children usually receive just one toy, `` because for each gift a parent must run, run, run to find it and then wait, wait, wait to buy it.''

<HEAD>Japan Approves Tax Reform Package</HEAD>

<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> won a major victory Saturday when parliament's upper house voted his controversial tax reform package into law, paving the way for the first overhaul of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s postwar tax system. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> used its commanding parliamentary majority to pass the package, which introduces a 3 percent sales tax and cuts corporate and upper-level income taxes. Strong public and political opposition stopped several previous tax reform attempts in the past 10 years. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>, who had set tax reform as his top priority, bowed deeply to the chamber after its approval and moved quickly to allay fears. `` I am well aware ... that there are fears and anxieties among the people about the new tax system,'' he said. `` The reform has laid the foundation for a prosperous aging society, and for sustaining the vitality of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s economy and society.'' <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> vowed not to increase the sales tax above 3 percent through the remainder of his term, which ends next fall. Opposition parties had raised concerns that the government would raise the rate to increase revenues. <PERSON> Takako </PERSON> <PERSON> Doi </PERSON>, who leads <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s largest opposition group, called the legislation `` defective'' and said her <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> would continue to demand the resignations of the <ORGANIZATION> Takeshita </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> and the dissolution of Parliament. The laws `` extend injustice and unfairness by forcing large sacrifices in people's daily lives through heavy tax burdens,'' <PERSON> Doi </PERSON> told a news conference. They cut taxes for corporations and higher wage-earners, but the tax burden of lower-income families is expected to increase. The measures constitute the first major overhaul of the tax system drafted by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> occupation authorities after <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s World War II defeat. Passage of the bills followed five months of deliberations that were interrupted by frequent opposition boycotts after disclosures that top politicians, including aides to Prime Minister <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> and former Finance Minister <PERSON> Kiichi </PERSON> <PERSON> Miyazawa </PERSON>, had profited from questionable stock dealings. Within minutes of the vote, <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> appointed a new finance minister, <PERSON> Tatsuo </PERSON> <PERSON> Murayama </PERSON>, one of the architects of the tax reform. <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> had been acting finance minister since Dec. 9, when <PERSON> Miyazawa </PERSON> resigned after being linked to the scandal. Approval ratings for the <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> administration plummeted over its handling of the stock scandal and tax package. The drop in support reflected the heavy importance the Japanese attach to political consensus. `` If <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> is a poor prime minister, or too straightforward, or not skilled at consensus-making, of course the bills would not pass,'' said <PERSON> Seizaburo </PERSON> <PERSON> Sato </PERSON>, a political science professor at <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` But the more important thing is that it took 10 years, and there was a growing consciousness emerging of the necessity of the sales tax,'' <PERSON> Sato </PERSON> said. Also Saturday, <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> said he would postpone until spring a planned January trip to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to meet with President-elect <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. Reports cited Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s precarious health and implementation of the tax plan as reasons for the delay.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> urged Americans today to remember those, both in their own country and in earthquake-stricken <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>, whose holidays are diminished by tragedy. `` We know that there are those among us for whom the holidays are painful and lonely,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said in his weekly radio broadcast, which was taped Thursday and broadcast as the president vacationed at his new home here. `` I know you join with me in hoping that this year they will take heart and have faith,'' he said. `` Now, here in our country, there are children without homes, suffering from dire diseases, whose Christmases will be makeshift at best,'' the president said. As he often has, he paid tribute to organizations, such as Toys for Tots, which provide gifts and other help for such children. `` I know all Americans have joined with me in grieving for those who perished in the Armenian earthquake,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. Here, too, the president praised the volunteer relief efforts from <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and other countries, including <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, which have poured into <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>. Athough the tape was made after Wednesday's crash of a Pan American jumbo jet in <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, the president made no mention of it. He did make a statement of condolence about the crash as he left the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> on Friday. Later in the day, he said that after nearly eight years of living upstairs in the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, he's awed by the 6,500-square-foot home he and his wife, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON>, will live in after his term ends Jan. 20. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> got his second look at the house Friday when he and the first lady arrived here to begin a two-week <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> vacation. `` I am awed and I love it,'' assistant White House Press Secretary <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinberg </PERSON> quoted the president as saying after the first lady took him on a tour of the secluded home in the ritzy Bel Air section of town. Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had confided to reporters earlier that she sneaked the president out of his hotel without reporters being told during one of their earlier visits to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> so <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> could get a peek at the house. She had him crouch down in a White House car so he could n't be seen, she said. The house stands on 1 \ acres of ground, with a swimming pool A group of 20 <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> friends of the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION> bought it in 1986 with them in mind. The Reagans are leasing the house from the group, called Wall Management. Before <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> became president, he and his family lived in <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palisades </LOCATION>, in the western part of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, in a house that has since been sold. They have a <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> style adobe house of five rooms and 1,500 square feet at their ranch in the <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ynez </LOCATION> mountains about 30 miles north of <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Barbara </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has said they plan to make occasional visits to the ranch during his retirement, just as they did while in the White House. The president and first lady were expected to go out to dinner Saturday night with <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Z. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wick </PERSON>, the director of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, and his wife.

<HEAD>Opposition Leader Urges Military Talks With North Korea</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Opposition leader <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Dae-jung </PERSON> on Saturday urged President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> <PERSON> Tae-woo </PERSON> to accept a North Korean call for political and military talks on easing tension on the divided <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> peninsula. <PERSON> Kim </PERSON>, who heads <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s largest opposition party, told reporters that positive overtures were needed from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> to end the military confrontation and expedite reunification with <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. The leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION> said substantial progress could be made next year in talks with <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> because changing circumstances on the peninsula were forcing the North to open its doors. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> has called for high-level political and military discussions between the two <LOCATION> Koreas </LOCATION> that could clear the way for summit talks on reuniting the peninsula. In addition, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> last week called for three-way talks among North and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to negotiate durable peace measures. On Saturday, members of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> agreed to consider the North's proposal for the political and military talks. Government officials who requested anonymity said <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> would seek a dialogue with the North at the level of prime minister. The <ORGANIZATION> Hankook </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ilbo </ORGANIZATION>, a leading <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> newspaper, said contacts are continuing through various channels to help realize <PERSON> Roh </PERSON>'s desire to hold a summit with his North Korean counterpart, <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Il </PERSON> <PERSON> Sung </PERSON>. Both Koreas in recent months have made proposals for improving relations, but little progress has been made. South Korean officials have said they believe the North's recent proposals were aimed mainly at removing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops from the South. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> contends the presence of 42,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops in the South is preventing reunification of the peninsula, which was divided in 1945 when <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet troops ended <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s colonial rule at the end of World War II. However, lawmakers from both sides are to resume talks on Dec. 29 on a possible non-aggression agreement and other peace measures. Meanwhile, Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> left <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> Saturday after a three-day visit during which he pledged his country would not establish diplomatic relations with <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, an official report said. The two countries stressed in a joint communique that a reduction of tensions between rival Koreas was `` of enormous importance in guaranteeing peace'' in the <LOCATION> Asia-Pacific </LOCATION> region, the official <ORGANIZATION> Korean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> expressed its support for <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> proposals for political and military talks between <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>, and for peace talks involving the two Koreas and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, said the agency dispatch, monitored in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. The Soviet side also reaffirmed its opposition to recognizing both Koreas as a means of reducing tension. It pledged it would not establish diplomatic relations with <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> despite its participation in the <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> Olympic Games and its increasing trade ties with the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> have called on <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s allies, to recognize <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> in exchange for their establishing relations with the North. But <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> has said such moves will lead to the permanent division of the peninsula.

 <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Smoot </PERSON> is a shopping mall <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Claus </LOCATION>, but he never says `` Ho, ho, ho,'' he never flirts, and he knows what to do if a frightened child wets on him. <PERSON> Smoot </PERSON> is a graduate of the `` <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Santa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Claus </ORGANIZATION>,'' a nationwide how-to course sponsored by Los Angeles-based <ORGANIZATION> Western </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Temporary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> to train a select few on the finer points of playing the jolly old elf. `` I never pictured myself as a <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Claus </LOCATION>,'' says <PERSON> Smoot </PERSON>, who calls himself a cowboy _ a horseshoer by trade. `` It was really overwhelming at first.'' This is <PERSON> Smoot </PERSON>'s first experience as <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION>. His towering 6-foot-4, nearly 300-pound frame helps him play the part. But he's more than just another pretty <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Smoot </PERSON>, 42, finished his training several weeks ago after being recruited by Western to serve as one of the company's Santas. `` We approached him. He's got that look about him, that sparkle in his eye,'' said <PERSON> Darla </PERSON> <PERSON> Lowell </PERSON>, manager of Western's <LOCATION> Tulsa </LOCATION> office. Western's course is based on the concept that there's more to being Santa than wearing a red suit and laughing a loud `` Ho, ho, ho.'' `` You can put the facade on, but it does n't work,'' said <PERSON> Jenny </PERSON> <PERSON> Zink </PERSON>, national director of marketing for Western in the company's <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> office Western trained more than 3,300 Santas this year to appear at shopping malls and department stores, even restaurants and bank lobbies, across the country. There's really no university, but graduates of the course do receive a diploma from Western's `` <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Santa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Claus </ORGANIZATION>.'' The company has more than 325 offices that specialize in finding temporary employees for clerical, technical, legal and accounting services. It takes its <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> business seriously. `` This is a very important job,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Zink </PERSON>, who heads Western's <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> division. `` We probably would n't spend half a day training a laborer to pick up a piano.'' Santas trained by Western must pass the company's course, which teaches them `` how to be authentic Santas,'' Ms. <PERSON> Lowell </PERSON> said. There's a 40-minute introduction video, instructions on what to say to children, suggested dialogue, lessons on how to dress like <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION>, and a requirement that each <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> know the names of all the reindeers. The course ends with a written test that prospective Santas must pass to graduate. `` Only one in 23 applicants is selected for <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION>,'' Ms. <PERSON> Lowell </PERSON> said. `` We interview a lot of people, check references and verify they are people of high character and morals.'' Western, which has provided Santas nationwide for 21 years, advises its Santas to follow the guidelines it provides when dealing with children. `` We frown upon any type of originality because it has been proven that this brings disaster,'' reads the company's manual for the `` Santa technique. Santas should address children as `` young fellow'' or `` young lady;'' refer to parents as `` folks'' because many children are adopted; never flirt _ <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> is married; ask children what toys they want for Christmas so they wo n't ask for intangible items, such as the reuniting of divorced parents; never make quick, jerky movements with small children who might be frightened by something unexpected; and if a child wets, calmly lift the child and cheerfully hand them back to the parent. Perhaps the most interesting instruction involves what most people identify with <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION>. `` We omit the `` Ho, ho, ho'' because it may frighten the children,'' the Western training manual states. `` Talk softly.''

<HEAD>Many Priests Overworked, Lonely and Sexually Troubled, Bishops Say</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID BRIGGS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A `` serious and substantial morale problem'' afflicts the nation's 53,500 Roman Catholic priests, many of whom are overworked, lonely and sexually troubled, says a groundbreaking report by a panel of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bishops. Discussing openly problems that once were kept quiet, the <ORGANIZATION> Bishops </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Priestly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said some priests are just going through the motions, and many `` have settled for a part-time presence to their priesthood.'' Part of the priests' morale problem, said the committee of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bishops </ORGANIZATION>, comes from the feeling that they are caught between <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> directives and a <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> laity that is often at odds with <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>. Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> has urged priests to accept suffering as part of their fate, but the American bishops have said that is not helpful and have compiled suggestions on how to improve priests' morale The panel report, obtained Friday by The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, said there are many creative and energetic priests, but `` it is also clear to us that there exists today a serious and substantial morale problem among priests in general.'' The report was hailed by <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> clerics as the first official recognition of the situation's gravity. `` I think it's very encouraging that the bishops are helping the priests name the pain,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> McNulty </PERSON>, who represented <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> priests before the pope last year in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. `` They're putting in this document what we've said ourselves over a cup of coffee. And that's a great help when you're trying to solve a problem.'' Bishop <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McRaith </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Owensboro </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, diocese, led the subcommittee that drafted the report. It was written for the nation's 300 bishops only, but church leaders decided in November to distribute it to priests. `` There really has been no scientific analysis done of the morale of priests,'' <PERSON> McRaith </PERSON> said Saturday. `` I think our point was that the morale of priests always needs attention.'' The shortage of priests is both a cause and a result of the morale problem, according to the report. A recent study by the <ORGANIZATION> Hartford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seminary </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Religious </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> said the number of <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> seminarians declined from 8,885 in 1965 to 4,063 in 1985, and estimated that the number of priests will decline 40 percent by the year 2000. About 15 percent of priests have left the priesthood since 1970, said <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoge </PERSON>, a sociologist at <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>. `` Am I in a dying profession?'' is the question that is starting to demoralize many priests, said sociologist <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Marty </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION>. `` There's that sense: Did I bet on the wrong thing?'' Mandatory celibacy is a major reason for clergy leaving the priesthood and for loneliness among those who stay, the bishops said. The church has not helped priests deal with their sexual feelings as it should, they said. They recommended that a priest's sexuality be recognized as an `` essential component of human existence'' and that better methods, including encouraging close friendships with men and women, be found to help priests lead a celibate life. `` There's just no support for that kind of life now,'' <PERSON> McRaith </PERSON> said. `` They are surrounded by a culture that is incredibly promiscuous.'' With rectories that used to be filled with half a dozen or so priests often housing just one today, the problem of loneliness is exacerbated. Loneliness `` is often mentioned by priests as cause for anxiety and pain,'' the report said. Another result of the shortage is that where priests could once look forward to a graceful retirement, now they face heavier workloads, `` long and painful battles over consolidation and closure of parishes, and less probability of retirement at all.'' The dwindling number of priests is ministering to a larger flock. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> population rose from 48 million in 1970 to 53.5 million in 1988. In reaction, the bishops said, many priests have chosen to `` drop out quietly. This is particularly true of those in the 45 to 60 age group who are willing to go through the necessary minimum of motions but whose hearts and energies are elsewhere.'' In his speech to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> priests last fall, the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> told them to bear their hardship with faith. `` The spirit God has given us is no cowardly spirit,'' he said. But the bishops' committee is saying `` you have to do more than tough it out. There are things that might be done,'' <PERSON> McNulty </PERSON> said. The <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>'s closing off discussion on issues such as celibacy and the ordination of women results in priests being `` caught in the middle,'' the panel said. `` Some priests feel that at times they are passing on to parishioners, who clearly disagree, pastoral decisions which they sense their bishops do not fully endorse and which they themselves personally question,'' it said. The committee recommended giving priests greater authority in making decisions that affect their lives, including participation in the selection of bishops. But <PERSON> McRaith </PERSON> minimized the differences between <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> priests and the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>. `` There are some things that are not resolvable, and that -LRB- celibacy -RRB- may be one,'' he said. `` So they -LRB- priests -RRB- have to be careful how they ask those questions.''

<TEXT>
 Time magazine has named the `` endangered Earth'' its Planet of the Year, departing from its annual Man of the Year designation to call for `` a universal crusade to save the planet.'' `` This year the Earth spoke, like God warning Noah of the deluge,'' the weekly newsmagazine said, citing natural and human-caused disasters from earthquakes to overpopulation to pollution of the world's beaches. Since 1927, <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> annually has selected the person, group or object that in its editors' views most significantly influenced world events that year. It selected an inanimate object once before _ the computer, in 1982. In the cover article of its Jan. 2 issue, released Saturday, <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> warned of a series of impending environmental catastrophes: _ Pollution-caused warming of the atmosphere, known as the `` greenhouse effect,'' threatening weather changes that could flood coastlines and render large areas of the planet infertile and uninhabitable _ Toxic and radioactive wastes and dumped garbage that could poison drinking water and despoil the land _ Chemical pollution that is depleting the atmosphere's protective ozone layer _ Clearing of tropical rain forests, driving thousands of species to extinction `` Most of these evils had been going on for a long time, and some of the worst disasters apparently had nothing to do with human behavior,'' Time said. `` Yet this year's bout of freakish weather and environmental horror stories seemed to act as a powerful catalyst for worldwide public opinion. `` Everyone suddenly sensed that this gyrating globe, this precious repository of all the life we know of, was in danger. No single individual, no event, no movement captured imaginations or dominated headlines more than the clump of rock and soil and water and air that is our common home.'' Added Time: `` Now, more than ever, the world needs leaders who can inspire their fellow citizens with a fiery sense of mission, not a nationalistic or military campaign but a universal crusade to save the planet.''

 To the wails of her mother, <PERSON> Svetlana </PERSON> <PERSON> Arikilyan </PERSON> was laid to rest in this devastated city on Saturday after grave diggers cut a hole in the black frozen earth with a jackhammer. `` Oh, my darling girl! Farewell! Farewell!'' a weeping <PERSON> Varsik </PERSON> <PERSON> Arikilyan </PERSON> exclaimed as pallbearers holding two worn ropes lowered her 36-year-old daughter's wooden coffin, draped in a royal blue cloth, into the ground. She cast a handful of dirt on the coffin, then turned away in agony. `` For us Armenians, there can be no holidays this year. No New Year's, no Christmas,'' said <PERSON> Edik </PERSON> <PERSON> Kasparyan </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Leninakan </LOCATION> teacher. `` There has been too much loss, too much death.'' <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>'s second-largest city, 11 miles east of the Turkish border, is still reeling from the Dec. 7 earthquake that Soviet officials estimate killed 55,000 people. As Soviets elsewhere prepare for the New Year's holiday and its rituals of gift-giving and family get-togethers, Armenians still are counting their dead and digging out from the ruins of the deadliest earthquake in their nation's history. Survivors come in gratitude to kiss the stone walls of <LOCATION> Leninakan </LOCATION>'s Armenian <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seven </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wounds </ORGANIZATION>, whose bell tower toppled to the ground, but whose sanctuary was spared by the great quake. For the survivors, there is also sorrow, pain, hunger and anger. Day and night, when the temperature drops near zero, the grisly search for the dead goes on. Shortly after dawn, rescuers combing the wreckage of a nine-story apartment building gently freed the body of 29-year-old <PERSON> Dina </PERSON> <PERSON> Mikhailovna </PERSON>. By her side was the body of her child, who could have been no more than 1 -LCB- years old, a smashed baby stroller and a plastic fir tree that the family had bought for the holidays. Mother and child were placed in a coffin made from particle board and painted black. Six men struggled to carry it down a snow-frosted mountain of smashed concrete and twisted pipes to a truck. Armenians, an ancient people who embraced <PERSON> Christianty </PERSON> as a state religion more than 1,600 years ago, have canceled Christmas festivities on Jan. 6, the date they and the other Eastern rites usually celebrate the birth of <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Christ </PERSON>. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Pashayan </PERSON>, 42, an Armenian who teaches French, was counting on receiving a new three-room apartment for his family in time for the New Year. Instead, his wife <PERSON> Knarik </PERSON>, 42, and his daughter and son died when their eighth-floor apartment crashed down around them. `` For the first week, I was out of my mind with grief,'' said the haggard, sunken-eyed <PERSON> Pashayan </PERSON>. `` But then I realized that if I had been left alive, it was to live. I asked, ` Why me?' When I look around I see that everyone here suffered. Every family.'' Once home to more than 280,000 people, <LOCATION> Leninakan </LOCATION> today has only 100,000 inhabitants, thousands of whom now live in tents. Many residents have been evacuated. Tens of thousands of homes, schools for 63,000 students, nurseries for 15,000 children and hospitals with nearly 5,000 beds will have to be built or repaired in the disaster area in two years, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. Its report came from a meeting in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> Saturday of the Council of Ministers, or Cabinet. Speakers at the meeting said government agencies had taken a `` businesslike and efficient approach'' in the search and rescue. But in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>, the Armenian capital, a commission of the ruling Politburo said the relief effort was not going smoothly, according to <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>. In <LOCATION> Leninakan </LOCATION>, hundreds of people maintain a vigil by bonfires that burn around the clock near about 200 wrecked and toppled buildings, waiting until bodies of their loved ones are borne from the smashed concrete and dust. `` I lost my whole family, my daughter, my son. Now I have no one to live with,'' said 70-year-old <PERSON> Avetik </PERSON> <PERSON> Alexanyan </PERSON>. He then began to cry. Trucks bring bread and lumps of hot boiled meat to <LOCATION> Leninakan </LOCATION>'s central square to feed the homeless, but some families receive only parcels of cold food Near the city's medical clinic, closed because of earthquake damage, people lined up at 6 a.m. to receive donated clothes from abroad. Eight hours later, scores of people were still waiting. A group of 50 West German relief workers gathered Saturday night for hot spiced wine from jerry cans and Christmas Eve dinner. A tape recorder played Christmas carols, including `` The First Noel,'' but there was scant holiday cheer.

<BYLINE>Home For Christmas: Do Homeless Prefer The Grate?

<TEXT>
 As President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> basks in the warmth of a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Christmas, the homeless people he said prefer to live on the streets gather around their flameless urban campfires in the wet chill of the capital. A sparsely decorated pine tree stands propped against a street lamp as a group of sturdy young men stamp their feet on a street grate above the city's underground network of heat and steam pipes. These men are four blocks from the <LOCATION> White </LOCATION> <LOCATION> House </LOCATION>, where this week <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> spoke of the homeless during a television interview with <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Brinkley </PERSON>. `` Those people still prefer -LRB- being -RRB- out there on the grates or the lawn to going into one of those shelters,'' the president said in the interview broadcast Thursday. The <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> called <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s remarks `` mean spirited and insensitive,'' saying the number of homeless has increased dramatically during his administration. Estimates range in the hundreds of thousands, with more than 15,000 in the nation's capital But some of the `` grate people'' say <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was correct, in a sense, about their preferences. `` Given the choice of one of the grates and the urine and the lice and the maggots -LRB- in shelters -RRB-, I'll take the grates,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, as a stiff, hot updraft warmed a small circle of men in their 20s and 30s. Others said the shelters were full anyway; they'd been turned away. None of them much liked what <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said about street people, especially his suggestion that most are mentally retarded. The president spoke of the release of mental patients from hospitals in the face of civil liberties demands: `` They wanted freedom, but they walked out to where there was nothing for them, and they are a large percentage of that group that you see out there,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. Again, some of the street people think <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> was partially correct. `` It was all done with good intentions when they started releasing people who were not a danger to others,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Moens </PERSON>, 29, who is clean, well-dressed, articulate and living over the grates across the street from the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. `` But it's more inhuman to let them stay out here and fend for themselves Some of them are psychotic and should be locked up.'' <ORGANIZATION> Moens </ORGANIZATION> said the young men in his group are on the streets to avoid the drug addicts, serious drunks, transvestites, criminals and psychotics who they say infest some of the shelters in the city. The Sheriff, Go Go <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> and the others who live over the grates make an odd family. A few said they have jobs but ca n't save enough to pay the minimum $ 65 a week for flophouse rent. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told <PERSON> Brinkley </PERSON> there are lots of jobs in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>: `` How could they be out there when every week ... you'll find from 60 to 75 full pages of help-wanted ads in the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> paper?'' the president asked. Go Go <PERSON> Joe </PERSON>, who prides himself on good personal hygiene and professes a deep Christian faith, said he has had several $ 3.35-an-hour, minimum-wage jobs. `` I challenge President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to live on that,'' he said. The Sheriff, who would not give his real name, showed his photo on a plastic <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> identification card and said he was working at the Pentagon and comes home to his park benches at night. He showed a recent color photo of his 11-year-old daughter. He said he sends her money every time he gets paid. `` I do n't want pity,'' he said. `` I'm just in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> trying to get a foothold. This is our living room and that's our television set.'' He pointed at a partially demolished building, a classy apartment house, a drug store and Riverside Liquors. Liquor store co-owner <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Fischer </PERSON> has a different view of the grates. Some of the men are his friends. One once brought him to tears, a fellow named <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> who came in so cold he could n't fasten his jacket. `` When he asked me to help him zip up, I got an image of my 7-year-old kid, and I cried,'' said <PERSON> Fischer </PERSON>. He agreed that some have serious mental problems. When one of the grate people lay down in the middle of E Street and started shooting at the sky with his fingers, <PERSON> Fischer </PERSON> said he telephoned for the police and an ambulance. Then, because it was lunchtime, he ordered a pizza. The pizza arrived first, and the authorities a couple of hours later, he said. And when an elderly, white-bearded derelict called Wolfman died a few weeks ago after living on the streets for more than two decades, he lay on a grate for three hours before anyone came to take away the body, <PERSON> Fischer </PERSON> said. `` The president has a very valid point about them preferring to live on the grates rather than in the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> shelters,'' said <PERSON> Fischer </PERSON>. `` But criminals in prison are treated better than these people.'' Another view of the homeless was offered Saturday by <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> majority whip <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>, D-Calif., in the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s weekly radio `` The reality is,'' <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> said, `` most of them are not much different from you or me. They are the elderly, the veterans, the physically disabled and the chronically ill. They are the drug and alcohol dependent. They're the migrant farm workers ... But in ever increasing numbers, <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s homeless are working families with kids.'' <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> said that while `` <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> never understood this issue'' of homelessness, Democrats were convinced his successor, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, `` will make a serious effort to deal with the tragedy of homelessness.''

<HEAD>Bush Tabs Elizabeth Dole As Labor Secretary</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Saturday named <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> as his secretary of labor, saying she has the `` experience, the stature and the ability'' to cope with the challenges of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s changing work force. Mrs. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, 52, former transportation secretary and the wife of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s bitter campaign rival, <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Minority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, R-Kan., is the first woman named to a full <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> post in the new administration, though <PERSON> Carla </PERSON> <PERSON> Hills </PERSON>, as the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade representative, will have <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> rank <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said a `` dramatic change'' has occurred as women enter the work force in increasing numbers, and, `` In this environment, it is essential that we have a secretary of labor who understands the challenges out there, and who has the experience, the stature and the ability to deal with them effectively.'' Other issues confronting the labor secretary are retraining displaced workers, ensuring better job safety, creating private-public partnerships and respecting workers' rights, the vice president said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s announcement, made the day before Christmas, means that only once <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> job _ energy secretary _ remains open. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he would reveal no more appointments before next Friday, following his return from a hunting and fishing trip in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, standing next to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> outside the vice president's mansion, said unemployment was at a 14-year low, but people were still unable to find work `` To promote and protect the welfare of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s working men and women, <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s working families, is a challenge I accept with great enthusiasm,'' she said. Mrs. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said she would give a high priority to issues such as child care and the homeless. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s selection drew praise from labor leaders as well as from key members of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, which will have to confirm Mrs. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>'s nomination to succeed <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Dore </PERSON> <PERSON> McLaughlin </PERSON> `` President-elect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> saved one of his best appointments until near the end,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, D-Mass., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> `` She is a woman of great ability with many friends in both parties on <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>.'' Sen. <PERSON> Orrin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Utah </LOCATION>, the ranking Republican on the committee, said Mrs. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> brings to the job `` a proven track record.'' At the <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, she pushed for safety issues, including requirements for passive restraints in automobiles. `` It looks like TV dinners for me again, but I'll still probably vote for her confirmation,'' Sen. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> joked. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said his wife, whom he and others call `` <PERSON> Liddy </PERSON>,'' will give `` 110 percent to make a difference for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the fact that Mrs. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> is married to the minority leader played no role in his decision. `` This appointment stands on its merits,'' he said. He joked that he would love to see some side benefits of the appointment, adding, `` Bob and I are on good footing.'' A <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> native and a Harvard-trained lawyer, Mrs. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> left her post as transportation secretary to work on her husband's unsuccessful 1988 presidential campaign After <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> seized the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nomination, she traveled around the country speaking on his behalf, often to evangelical groups. Mrs. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> has long been rumored for a spot in the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration and was on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s short list of vice presidential running mates. She was known to have wanted the position of <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> ambassador, a job <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> gave to career diplomat <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickering </PERSON>. Before moving to transportation, Mrs. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> was a high-ranking <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> staffer, serving as a liaison between President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and special interest groups. She had contacts then with organized labor. Before <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s election in 1980, Mrs. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> was a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. Said <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirkland </PERSON>: `` We look forward to working with her. She is a person of proven stature and wide experience in public life who will give the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> an important voice in the affairs of interest to working Americans.'' On specific labor issues, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he still favors raising the minimum wage, but he did not know when he might ask <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to take that step. He was also non-commital on broadening job protection for parents who want to take leaves when children are born or fall ill. Mrs. <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, like many of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s Cabinet members, is a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> veteran, prompting questions about <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s stated commitment to bring fresh faces to the nation's capital <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> dismissed the idea that his Cabinet does not have enough new blood. `` The fact that somebody has had experience should not rule her face or his face into an ` old face' category,'' he said. Besides the post of energy secretary, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he still is looking for someone to fill the new post of drug czar. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Raab </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, is known to be interested in that slot. Recent speculation for the energy job centered on <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, a former administrator of the <ORGANIZATION> Bonneville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>; former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> Henson </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> and Lt. Gen. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrahamson </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Initiative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> at the Pentagon. Through Saturday, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had filled 13 Cabinet positions.

 The House of Commons on Saturday approved the Canada-U.S. free trade agreement as opposition lawmakers sang the country's national anthem to protest what they said was a sellout of <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s sovereignty. The sweeping legislation will begin breaking down trade and business barriers with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as early as New Year's Day. `` People will look back on this and say it was a good day for <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>,'' said Prime Minister <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON>. He said the agreement, which was approved by a vote of 141-111, would bring economic prosperity. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> administration trade official welcomed the Commons vote, saying the trade pact would spur economic growth on both sides of the border. `` We're just very pleased the Canadian <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> has acted positively on the free-trade agreement,'' said <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> <PERSON> Winkler </PERSON>, spokesman for Trade Representative <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Yeutter </PERSON>. The agreement was the focus of national elections Nov. 21, in which <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Progessive </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> won a second consecutive majority government. `` It was a tough road; this is a rough business,'' <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> told reporters outside the Commons, which had met past midnight. Legislators of the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> sang `` O <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>,'' the Canadian national anthem, to protest passage of the bill. Members of another opposition group, the New Democrats, were silent as they voted against it. The pact is scheduled to take effect Jan. 1 after consideration by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, which has promised to approve the legislation next week. Under the agreement, all remaining tariffs between the two neighbors are to be phased out over a 10-year period. Trade between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> was about $ 160 billion last year. The opposition bitterly opposed the pact on the ground that it would cost Canadians jobs. After the election, the Commons was recalled Dec. 12 to deal with the agreement. <PERSON> Mulroney </PERSON> signed the trade agreement with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in January. It was approved by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>.

 The following is a text of Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>'s homily for Christmas Eve midnight Mass in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peter </LOCATION>'s Basilica. The original was to be given in Italian. The following is the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>'s official English-language version: `` I bring you good news of a great joy for to you is born ... a savior'' -LRB- Luke 2:10 -11 -RRB- We hear this voice which emanates from the depths of the night of <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION>. The shepherds `` keeping watch over their flock by night'' -LRB- <PERSON> Luke </PERSON> 2:8 -RRB- were the first to hear it. For this reason the Midnight Liturgy is sometimes called the `` Shepherds' Mass.'' We are gathered in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peter </LOCATION><LOCATION> 's </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Basilica </LOCATION> to hear once more these same words: `` I bring you good news of a great joy.'' By means of radio and television, peoples of different languages, nations, countries and continents are listening with us to this message. Thus, again in the different parts of the world. And even if the words which we hear on Christmas night are the same every year, yet they are always eagerly awaited by us and are for us always new. `` Today ... is born ... a savior, who is Christ the Lord.'' He is born once more. Once more he has come into the world, on the night of <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION>. For we relive as ours that distant `` today'' of almost 2,000 years ago. `` A Savior is born to you.'' It may seem that people have achieved a great deal, and continue to do so, in `` saving'' themselves with their own resources, so that they may be self-sufficient, that all the things that are termed `` civilization,'' `` progress'' and `` development'' do not reach the roots of the evil which still persists in human history and even, in a sense, is becoming deeper and more widespread. And, on the other hand, all the things that help to `` raise'' the level of human existence, that make it `` better,'' do not reach the perfection of that good to which the human being is directed. Meanwhile the words: `` A savior is born to you'' continue to touch what is permanent and real in man, what is profoundly true. And every year these words are awaited with the same basic motivations in our humanity, even if we are very often unaware of them. On that night, the shepherds in <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION> experienced deep amazement. What they heard at first filled them with fear. But, `` do not be afraid'' the Messenger says, `` I bring you good news of great joy.'' At the moment in which God the Son, of the same substance as the Father is born as man, comes into the world as a son of man, as the son of <PERSON> Mary </PERSON>, we can not but be overcome by deep amazement. The whole Gospel is the book of great amazement. For God is eternal and invisible. He is all-embracing. `` In him we live and move and have our being'' -LRB- Acts 17:28 -RRB-. God is omnipotent. He is totally other: different from the whole of creation. He is absolute Transcendence. Is it possible that he becomes man? That he is born in an abandoned stable, as a child of homeless parents? Why? Cur Deus homo -LRB- Why did God become Man -RRB-? The night of <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION> is the wellspring of this amazement. The first to experience it were these shepherds. And in this amazement there was first fear, and then joy. It is not something transitory. It is preserved by the human consciousness for the whole of life. Every individual must constantly ask the question: cur <PERSON> Deus </PERSON> <PERSON> Homo </PERSON>? He must constantly seek the answer and find it gradually. He must embrace the mystery revealed this night and enter into it ever more deeply. Yes. The mystery. It is good when one experiences fear, an interior tremor. And it is also good when one finds joy. But it is not good when one or the other is missing. It is not good. Man can not remain indifferent to the mystery of the night of <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION>. He can not reject the question cur Deus homo? This would constitute a deep `` wound'' in his humanity. Thus all people are called to share in this night ... `` Declare his glory among the nations, his marvelous works among all the peoples.'' -LRB- See also Psalms 95 @ 96:3 -RRB-. In the context of the Christmas mystery, human history, the history of each and every individual _ is called to overcome that limit which can interiorly obstruct the journey towards the salvation offered by God. People can ignore this call. They can even refuse to accept it. But `` salvation'' can not come to them except from God. And it has come! On this very night. God is born as man, who is a creature. Does not the whole of creation find its place in this mystery? What significance has the fact that we invite earth and sea to share in the joy of Christmas? `` Let the heavens be glad and let the earth rejoice, Let the sea roar, and all that fills, let the field exult and everything in it. Then shall all the trees of the wood sing for joy.'' -LRB- Psalms 95 @ 96:11 -12. <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION> _ it literally means the `` house of bread.'' <PERSON> Christ </PERSON>, who was born there, without a roof, will construct in the history of the world a dwelling which corresponds to the meaning of this place: <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION>. The House of Bread: The Eucharist. He himself, the savior, will live in this house in a sacramental manner. Indeed, he will actually be this house: His Body and his Blood. The whole of humanity, in which the divine transformation of man has its origin. In this way, man will constantly be able to overcome the limit placed in the way of salvation _ eternal salvation _ which God himself has opened up with the human birth of the Word, his Eternal Son. With the human birth of God. Truly. `` The people who walked in darkness have seen a great light; those who dwelt in a land of deep darkness, on them has light shined'' -LRB- <PERSON> Isiah </PERSON> 9:1 -RRB-. Truly. `` Fear not, behold I bring you good news of great joy.''

<HEAD>Polisario Front To Meet Morocco in First Contact in 13 Years</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ALGIERS, Algeria (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Polisario </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> announced Saturday it is sending a top-level delegation to meet <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION>'s King <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> II. It would be the first such encounter since Polisario guerrillas went to war with <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION> 13 years ago. No date for the meeting or names of delegates were given. The statement issued here by the <ORGANIZATION> Polisario </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> said the initiative follows a declaration by the Moroccan monarch to the French press that he was ready to meet Polisario officials. The group called <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON>'s statement `` a constructive position taken in response to repeated calls by the Polisario for dialogue.'' The talks would be the first direct contacts between <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION> and the Polisario or its political structure, the <LOCATION> Saharawi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Democratic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>, since the guerrilla group began fighting <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION> for independence for the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sahara </LOCATION>, annexed by <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION> in 1975. The Polisario statement said the group would cooperate fully with the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unity </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, which have been seeking a peaceful solution to the conflict. Both <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION> and the Polisario have agreed in principle to a referendum on the future of the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sahara </LOCATION>. However, the statement reiterated Polisario's stance that Moroccan troops and administration in the disputed territory remain an obstacle to the process and should be removed. Polisario declared the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sahara </LOCATION> a republic in February 1976. It has since been recognized by 45 countries, 27 of them Organization of African Unity members. <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION> quit the group in 1980 when the <LOCATION> Saharawi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Democratic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> became a member.

 Christmas came early this year for a disabled boy who told Santa the only gift he wanted was a wheelchair for his mom. A motorized wheelchair arrived Friday from <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, for <PERSON> Victoria </PERSON> <PERSON> Coslett </PERSON>, 39. Weeks ago, it appeared that Ms. <PERSON> Coslett </PERSON> and her 10-year-old son, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Wonggoun </PERSON>, would not celebrate Christmas. With his mother confined to their apartment and unable to maneuver her old wheelchair outdoors to watch him play, <PERSON> Wonggoun </PERSON> wrapped empty boxes to place under the sparsely decorated Christmas tree, then sat down and wrote <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION>. His letter said: `` The only gift i would like is an elecric wheelchair for my mom. She ca n't walk and her hands are to weak for the one welfair gave her 2 years ago. I would love to see her outside without help and watch me play. Can you help me with my wish?'' The note made it as far as the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Postal Service in <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Denise </PERSON> <PERSON> Reusche </PERSON>, a clerk, opened the letter. Each year, the post office in the desert resort processes about 1,000 letters to <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION>. Workers usually send a letter in return. But when Ms. <PERSON> Reusche </PERSON> read <PERSON> John </PERSON>'s letter, she decided to contact <ORGANIZATION> Fortress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scientific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION> wheelchair manufacturer, which shipped the gift. Ms. <PERSON> Coslett </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> were injured in a 1981 traffic crash. She was left with ruptured spinal discs. <PERSON> John </PERSON> was partially brain damaged and suffers recurring seizures and memory lapses. He also has juvenile arthritis.

<TEXT>
 A convenience store clerk was treated to a little adult entertainment when a man stripped down to a G-string and leather jacket and bumped and ground his way down the candy aisle. Circle K clerk <PERSON> Annette </PERSON> <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> said a man entered the store about 3 a.m. Friday and asked if he could use the restroom. She told him this was n't permitted to customers, and the man smiled and left. But minutes later he returned while she was talking on the phone. `` When I looked up, he was standing there with nothing but a G-string and leather jacket on,'' <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> said. `` I told my friend, ` I've got a stripper, I'll have to call the cops.''' Once the stripper had her attention, he began performing. `` He walked up, picked up a <ORGANIZATION> Thrifty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nickel </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- newspaper -RRB- and did some pumping motions, if you know what I mean,'' <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> said. `` Then he went down one aisle and then came up the candy aisle and stood in front of the candy counter and did some more of his motions. He heard me say I was calling the police, but he just stood there until I dialed the numbers. Then he left.'' The stripper did n't know when to quit his act though. He was arrested on a complaint of indecent exposure shortly after he appeared outside another convenience store. He was released without any charge being filed, but police are still investigating. `` I was talking to my friend -LRB- at a second store -RRB- when she spotted the guy walking around outside her store,'' <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> said. `` About that time a cop walked in to ask me some follow-up questions and I told him what was going on. He radioed it in and a cop who was nearby caught him near the store on Lakeshore Drive. He was only wearing his G-string and a leather jacket.'' <PERSON> Ochoa </PERSON> says the strip show was something of a shock. Still, she believes something good came from his performance. `` It kept me awake.''

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> opened talks Saturday with the exiled king of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> about a new peace plan for the war-torn country, officials said. <PERSON> Yuli </PERSON> <PERSON> Vorontsov </PERSON>, Soviet ambassador to <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and a first deputy foreign minister, said the talks with the exiled king focused on a proposal for convening a council in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> of 50 to 60 politicians or prominent individuals to create a new government. Afghan rebels have spoken recently about forming a broad-based government to succeed the Soviet-backed regime. But <PERSON> Vorontsov </PERSON>'s comments were the most detailed yet made publicly about the new proposal The Soviet official said his government had presented the plan to Pakistan-based Moslem rebels earlier this month and `` we are still waiting for -LRB- their -RRB- word.'' <PERSON> Vorontsov </PERSON> said the two-hour session Saturday with former King <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Zaher </PERSON> <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> was `` very useful.'' <PERSON> Zaher </PERSON> <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> has lived in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> since he was overthrown in 1973. `` We had a very long extensive discussion which covered lots of elements of the plan, of the future, -LRB- of -RRB- possibilities,'' he told reporters at the residence of the Soviet ambassador to <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>. He declined, however, to say whether the king was receptive to going back to <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> as part of a transitional government. While the 74-year-old ex-king still has a following in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, some Moslem resistance groups remain strongly opposed to him. The Soviets are anxious to see a stable government in place that will end the 10-year-old <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> war and not persecute Afghan communists. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> signed an accord with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in April under which the Soviets are to withdraw their estimated 115,000 troops from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> by Feb. 15, 1989. However, <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> has since suspended the pullout, charging that there have been violations of the accords by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, who back the rebels. The war has continued. <PERSON> Vorontsov </PERSON> declared that the different Afghan groups had to start negotiating with each other. `` There is a suggestion that comes from <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> that the first initial group of representatives of all kinds of political factions, 50-60 persons, get together, in the capacity of the representatives of political parties or in their personal capacity as authoritative figures, but sitting together starting to formulate the future of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>,'' he said. He added that the group should form a ruling body or administrative council that would govern until new elections could be called. <PERSON> Vorontsov </PERSON> said the plan had the approval of some rebels, the Pakistani government and the Afghan government. He said it would be presented shortly to Afghan rebel groups based in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. The new ruling council could be put together by Feb. 15, he said. <PERSON> Vorontsov </PERSON> also said that several Afghan rebel groups were holding secret talks with the Soviet-backed <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> government. The Pakistan-based rebels have vowed never to deal with <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>. In an address to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> earlier this month, Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> proposed a Jan. 1 cease-fire in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and a cut-off of all military supplies to the country. `` We still think that it is feasible to work with that target date in mind,'' <PERSON> Vorontsov </PERSON> said. There was no comment from the former Afghan king about Saturday's meeting, which took place at his walled compound in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> His spokesman, Gen. <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Wali </PERSON>, told reporters that the Soviet official `` had been received for an exchange of views.'' In the past, <PERSON> Zaher </PERSON> <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> has been guarded in his public statements, saying that Afghan leaders should be assembled to decide on a transition team. <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> has been locked in civil war since the April 1978 revolution that brought a socialist government to power in the Islamic nation. Soviet troops were sent to the neighboring country in 1979 to prop up the allied government. <PERSON> Zaher </PERSON> <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> lost his throne when his cousin and former prime minister, <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Daud </PERSON>, seized power in July 1973. The king, who had been in power for 40 years, was in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> at the time, taking a rheumatism cure at the baths in <LOCATION> Ischia </LOCATION>. Leftists in the army supported the coup and anti-communist exiles believe it paved the way for the more openly pro-Soviet coup in 1978.

 An express passenger train slammed into a bus filled with peasants in northeast <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, killing at least 46 people, official reports said early Sunday. The train, bound for <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, was approaching a crossing in <LOCATION> Liaoning </LOCATION> province on Friday night when the bus began to cross the tracks, the <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> news agency said. Two rail cars overturned in the crash, it said. National television said Saturday that 84 peasants were on the bus, heading home to Inner <LOCATION> Mongolia </LOCATION>. The television report said 67 people were injured, many critically, but the later <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> report put the number at 54. The discrepancy could not immediately be resolved. The train began in the city of <LOCATION> Dandong </LOCATION> on the Chinese border with <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> said the crash took place in central <LOCATION> Liaoning </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Qinghemen </LOCATION>, about 100 miles west of the provincial capital of <LOCATION> Shenyang </LOCATION>. It said the engine and a second car were overturned and three other train cars derailed. The TV showed the bus, mangled beyond recognition, and a row of bodies at the scene. Neither it nor <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> said whether anyone on the train was killed. Police are investigating the cause of the accident, the TV said. The collision was the fifth major train accident this year. The most serious was a derailment in southwest <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Yunnan </LOCATION> province in January in which 88 people died. A train collision in <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION> in March killed 28 people, including 27 members of a Japanese high school tour group. The minister of railways, <PERSON> Ding </PERSON> <PERSON> Guangen </PERSON>, resigned in disgrace in early March after the first three accidents and his successor, <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Senmao </PERSON>, promised to correct safety and maintenance failures blamed for the earlier accidents. Trains are the main means of long-distance transport in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, carrying about 1.2 billion passengers a year.

<TEXT>
 Authorities in a district where independent groups this month held their first legal rally in almost 20 years have called the rally anti-socialist and banned such gatherings in the future, a newspaper said Saturday. The Communist party daily Rude Pravo said the ban was decided at a meeting Thursday of officials from <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>'s third district, close to the city center, and organizers of the Dec. 10 rally marking 40 years of the <ORGANIZATION> Universal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Declaration </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION>. In the peaceful hour-long rally, called by five unofficial groups, well-known independent activists addressed a public crowd for the first time since the end of 1968's `` Prague Spring'' reforms. Several speeches called for peaceful changes in the current system. At the end, a crowd of about 3,000 approved a declaration calling for the release of all political prisoners, full religious freedom, legalization of groups independent of the ruling <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> party </ORGANIZATION> and a new constitution. Rude Pravo said the organizers of the Dec. 10 meeting `` were told openly they did not adhere to the conditions under which they got permission for the public gathering.'' `` The content of slogans and some of the performances stepped outside the boundaries of this covenant,'' wrote Rude Pravo commentator <PERSON> Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Boudova </PERSON>. The rally `` was aimed against <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> order and proved the real intention of organizers to misuse the gathering for political provocation,'' she said. The decision was preceded by publication in Rude Pravo Dec. 15 and 16 of readers' letters attacking the Dec. 10 meeting. `` We can not and must not let Czech Walesas infringe upon the legal order, and what is worse, trifle with serious questions of democracy and justice,'' wrote one reader Dec. 16, referring to Solidarity leader <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Petr </PERSON> <PERSON> Uhl </PERSON>, one of the activists involved in negotiations with the authorities before the Dec. 10 gathering, said there had been no mention then of limits on the content of slogans or speeches at the rally. `` It is false, quite false, that we the independent groups have violated such conditions,'' he said. <PERSON> Uhl </PERSON> said neither of the two activists who met with authorities on Thursday were in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> over the Christmas weekend.

 A man jailed on drug charges got to go home for Christmas after a judge threatened to jail his own cousin, the chief criminal deputy in the sheriff's office, for refusing to allow the furlough. `` I'm obeying the rules, but I'm protesting them,'' Chief Criminal Deputy <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Stassi </PERSON> said after <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Scioneaux </PERSON>, 27, of <LOCATION> White </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Castle </LOCATION> was released Friday on a court order from State District Judge <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Marionneaux </PERSON>. <PERSON> Marionneaux </PERSON>'s threat to send <PERSON> Stassi </PERSON> to jail is not the first public rift between the cousins. The judge, who ordered <PERSON> Stassi </PERSON> out of his court in 1985 after the chief deputy lambasted him during a hearing, said his cousin has a grudge against him. The judge said Sheriff <PERSON> Freddie </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pitre </PERSON> Sr. often lets prisoners out, and <PERSON> Scioneaux </PERSON> is a `` local boy'' who is unlikely to jump bail. <PERSON> Stassi </PERSON> said <PERSON> Scioneaux </PERSON>, arrested Nov. 27 for possessing cocaine and marijuana with intent to distribute them, has been arrested repeatedly and did n't merit a weekend pass. The <ORGANIZATION> Clerk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s Office said <PERSON> Scioneaux </PERSON> was convicted in 1984 of burglary and in 1986 of marijuana possession. Scioneaux was being held on $ 60,000 bond when <PERSON> Marionneaux </PERSON> asked for his release on a weekend pass, <PERSON> Stassi </PERSON> said. The sheriff refused that request Friday morning, <PERSON> Stassi </PERSON> said. But when <PERSON> Marionneaux </PERSON> called later, the judge threatened to jail his cousin, <PERSON> Stassi </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Marionneaux </PERSON> said that, because it was Christmas, he changed the bond so Scioneaux could be released on his own recognizance. `` All of this goes back on him at 9 a.m. Monday. It's just a weekend pass,'' the judge said.

<TEXT>
 The mayor of <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION>, in a Christmas message, proposed a one-year truce between the Jewish state and <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> struggling against <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation. Mayor <PERSON> Elias </PERSON> <PERSON> Freij </PERSON> also said Saturday that he hopes <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> would accept the `` land for peace'' formula in <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace talks. `` We hope the -LRB- <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> -RRB- government will become more realistic and accept territory for peace, rather than the concept of territory with peace,'' he said on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio. He proposed a U.N.-sponsored agreement to end violence in the occupied territories and clashes between the Israeli and allied forces and Palestinian guerrillas in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. `` The Palestinians would be happy to accept a honorable truce. It would be a great moral victory for them,'' he said in an interview published Friday in the weekend edition of the <ORGANIZATION> Jerusalem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> daily. <PERSON> Freij </PERSON> proposed that the truce be signed by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s new coalition government rules out talks with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, which it considers a terrorist organization. Under <PERSON> Freij </PERSON>'s proposed accord, the yearlong <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> rebellion against Israeli rule in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> would come to a halt. At least 333 Palestinians and 14 Israelis have been killed since violence broke out in the occupied lands on Dec. 8, 1987. In return, <PERSON> Freij </PERSON> said, the bulk of <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops would have to withdraw from these territories, which <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> captured in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> would also release 1,450 Palestinians now held in adminitrative detention, reopen 20 universities and colleges in the occupied lands, cancel expulsion orders against Palestinians and stop the practice of house demolitions as punishment for guerrilla activities. `` We have to be more optimistic, that next year there will be more hope,'' <PERSON> Freij </PERSON> told the radio. He spoke as Christmas Eve began in the Palestinian city of 35,000, the birthplace of <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON>, and carols reverberated over loudspeakers across Manger Square. But Christian pilgrims were discouraged by drenching rain, heavy Israeli security and Palestinian general strike. In the newspaper interview, <PERSON> Freij </PERSON> was quoted as saying his idea could lay the groundwork for an international peace forum leading to an agreement `` on internationally defined borders where both <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION> each can live in peace.'' <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has raised different interim ideas to launch peace talks, ranging from elections in the occupied lands to choose <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> negotiators acceptable both to it and the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, to unilateral autonomy or limited self-rule for Palestinians. But it says violence in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> must stop before any such negotiations start. <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, on the other hand, has said repeatedly that the Palestinian uprising will continue as liberation struggle. Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> said on Israeli radio that he did n't know of `` any member of this government who accepts negotiations with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. What we are seeking is direct negotiations with various <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> countries and the Palestinian Arab population.'' In downtown <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>, thousands of Israelis gathered under a pouring rain at a city square to demand peace talks with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. The demonstration was led by the leftist Peace Now movement and was attended by many left-wing legislators. Demonstrators held signs reading, `` Talk peace with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> now,'' and `` Two countries for the two people.'' Speakers urged the government to adopt a peace strategy based on the recent <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> decision to launch a dialogue with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> and what they termed a `` change in the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> approach'' towards <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>.

 Five Palestinians were wounded Saturday in the occupied lands, one in a clash with Israeli troops, and an Arab died of wounds suffered in an earlier clash with soldiers, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> hospitals and news reports said. Also Saturday, two Arabs died and three others were wounded as they `` handled an explosive device'' in the small West bank village of <PERSON> Marj </PERSON> <PERSON> en </PERSON> <PERSON> Naja </PERSON>, an army spokesman said. The army did not have any further details. The streets of the biblical town of <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION> were nearly empty for Christmas Eve as rain, tight Israeli security and an Arab strike kept most of the town's 35,000 <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> residents indoors and dissuaded tourists. Underground leaders of the Arab uprising declared Christmas Eve a day of solidarity with the 334 Palestinians killed during the year-old revolt. Fourteen Israelis also have died in the violence. In the village of <LOCATION> Ijah </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, a 55-year-old man, his wife and two sons were wounded in the legs, said officials at <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>' Ittihad Hospital <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said the four were shot by a village mukhtar, or local leader, who used an Israeli-issued weapon. Reasons for the clash were not immediately clear. The Israeli news agency <ORGANIZATION> Itim </ORGANIZATION> said the clash began when several masked people attacked the house of the mukhtar, who was accused of collaborating with <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> authorities, and injured six family members. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio quoted security sources as saying that a family feud was behind the attack and that police were looking into the incident. In the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, stores were shut and the army closed three schools after students set up rock barricades in the street and pelted soldiers with stones. A 15-year-old boy from <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>'s Jabaliya refugee camp was shot in the right leg after a clash with troops, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> doctors said. In <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, a 21-year-old <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> man who was shot in the head by soldiers during a demonstration last week died of his wounds, hospital officials said. In Arab east <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> hurled stones at police in the <LOCATION> Shuafat </LOCATION> neighborhood. Police fired back tear gas and rubber bullets and arrested 15 rioters, officials said.

<HEAD>Paraplegic Woman Believed to Have Been Raped Delivers Healthy Child</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BALTIMORE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A paraplegic woman disabled by head injuries gave birth to a healthy girl who police believe was conceived when the woman was raped in her hospital bed. The mother was unaware she delivered the infant, police said. The woman, who is in her 20s, has been hospitalized at <ORGANIZATION> Deaton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> since the spring of 1987. She was admitted Thursday to <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> with high temperature and abdominal pains and gave birth there. The woman was not able to report any rape, and police learned of the case only when the baby was born. They were told the victim `` was not able to resist or consent to sexual advances,'' said a police spokeswoman. So far, there is no suspect. `` They -LRB- <LOCATION> Deaton </LOCATION> officials -RRB- said she was suffering from abdominal pains and had a disshaped abdomen. They thought she had a blockage in the bowels,'' said the victim's sister, her legal guardian. At <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, physicians discovered the woman was nine months pregnant and in labor. She gave birth to a healthy 8-pound, 3-ounce girl without realizing what had taken place, a hospital official said. The sister said family members will meet to discuss moving the woman from <PERSON> Deaton </PERSON>, where she was placed on the advice of physicians from the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maryland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trauma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> following her treatment for accident injuries. `` I do n't believe my mother or my brother will allow her to stay there,'' said the sister, who has custody of the woman's young son and plans to care for the newborn. `` I always thought <PERSON> Deaton </PERSON> patients were in protective care. Somebody was n't doing their job,'' she said. <PERSON> Errol </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Newport </PERSON>, administrator of the 320-bed facility, said patient confidentiality prevented him from commenting on the case. The young woman was struck by a car in February 1987 when she ran into traffic while trying to keep a girlfriend who had been drinking from getting hit by a car, the sister said. The injuries left her almost totally incapacitated and unable to talk. `` She can move her left leg a little and has involuntary movement in her left hand,'' but is generally unaware of her surroundings, the sister said.

<HEAD>Miami News `Conceputal' Sale Agreement Could Save Paper</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The owner of The <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> has reached an agreement in principle to sell the 93-year-old daily newspaper, which is scheduled to shut down Dec. 31, the paper reported Saturday. <ORGANIZATION> Cox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprises </ORGANIZATION> has `` conceptually agreed'' to an amended offer from an out-of-state investor group. <ORGANIZATION> Cox </ORGANIZATION> hopes to close the deal before its self-imposed Dec. 31 deadline for selling the paper or folding it, a <ORGANIZATION> Cox </ORGANIZATION> official said. <PERSON> Cox </PERSON> might consider keeping the paper open for a short time after Dec. 31 if a deal appears imminent, said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Easterly </PERSON>, president of the Atlanta-based <ORGANIZATION> Cox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Newspapers </ORGANIZATION> division. `` We have conceptually agreed to what was submitted _ we did that -LRB- Friday -RRB- _ and the next move is up to the bidder,'' Easterly said. `` There has been no contract signed and no earnest money put forward. ... There is a lot still to be done. We are trying to get this bidder to come in and make a deal.'' Easterly would not discuss details of the amended offer. Friday's developments came a day after the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> said it is investigating whether the planned closing of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> violates antitrust laws. <PERSON> Easterly </PERSON> said the impending probe had no effect on the negotiations. Easterly confirmed that a different offer was received late Wednesday from the sole active bidder. Easterly declined to identify the bidder, but <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> newspaper consultant <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Malone </PERSON> said recently that it's an investor group he represents. On Oct. 14, <ORGANIZATION> Cox </ORGANIZATION> officials announced that The News would be closed by next Saturday if it were not sold. They cited financial and circulation losses. Under a joint operating agreement signed in 1966 with The <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publishing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, The News' printing, circulation, advertising and promotion services are provided by The <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> probe centers on whether an amendment to the agreement, which would allow <ORGANIZATION> Cox </ORGANIZATION> to close or sell The News now _ nine years before the original pact was to expire _ and continue collecting a share of <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> profits for the next 33 years, violates antitrust laws. Facilities being offered for sale by <ORGANIZATION> Cox </ORGANIZATION> include the newspaper's name, subscription list and some newsroom equipment Since the agreement with The <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> went into effect, The News' circulation has declined from 112,000 to 48,000, <ORGANIZATION> Cox </ORGANIZATION> officials said

<HEAD>25 People Hurt In Stampede At Disco Following Tear Gas Explosion</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Tear gas was fired into a crowded disco near a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> base in <LOCATION> Okinawa </LOCATION> on Saturday, and 25 people were injured in the stampede, two critically, police said. About 200 people, most of them foreigners, were in the second-floor disco at 1 a.m. when people began rushing down the stairs to escape the gas, said a police official, speaking on condition of anonymity. `` The crowd panicked,'' he said. The official said some foreigners were among the 25 people injured as they fell or were pushed down the stairs. The two people in critical condition were a Japanese woman and <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> woman, he said. Both women initially were identified as Japanese. The two women were unconscious and were being treated at a hospital, but were not in a life-threatening condition, police said. The names of the injured were not immediately available. Police said they were investigating the incident in cooperation with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military authorities. The Apple House disco is in <LOCATION> Okinawa </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Uechi </PERSON> city near <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kadena </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Air </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Base </LOCATION> and is frequented by foreigners, the police official said. Police refused to comment on whether <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> servicemen may have brought the tear-gas bomb into the disco. But the <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> quoted an employee at the disco as saying he saw a foreigner throw something in the room and then run out of the disco. The network showed pictures of the tear-gas canister it said had been found in the disco. The tear-gas bomb is a type used by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military, it said. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military officials were not immediately available for comment because of the Christmas weekend. In recent months, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> has been involved in a series of incidents that have brought sharp criticism from the Japanese press and government, and charges that it disregards public safety. In October, numerous rifle bullets hit a civilian housing area near a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military firing range on <LOCATION> Okinawa </LOCATION>. The following month, two <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> helicopters collided over the island, killing four Marines. Also in November, a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> skipper was transferred after his ship fired practice shells in a commercial shipping area that came within 330 yards of a Japanese coast guard vessel. About 64,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops are stationed in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> under a mutual security pact. Of the total, about 35,000 are stationed in <LOCATION> Okinawa </LOCATION>, which has a population of 1.2 million.

 <LOCATION> LOCKERBIE </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> _ Authorities found 84 more bodies Saturday from the crash of <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> Flight 103 as this grief-stricken little village tried to keep Christmas from being erased from its calendar. Police Chief <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyd </PERSON> said there would be no scaling down of the search until the bodies of all 258 people aboard the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 and those who died on the ground are located. Helicopters and more than 600 people searched miles of Scottish countryside for victims of Wednesday night's crash, which showered this quiet town with flames and shards of jagged metal. Among the dead is the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>'s station chief in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said Saturday. In the town of 2,500 people, shops remained open and churches held Christmas Eve services, but the heart had gone out of the holiday. The Rev. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Keegans </PERSON> of the town's <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, whose own home was destroyed in the crash, put Christmas preparations aside Saturday to meet with relatives of the victims at a counseling center in the parish hall. Police spokesman <PERSON> Angus </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said Saturday night that 84 more bodies were recovered after the search area was expanded, bringing the total to 239. None of the bodies has been positively identified, and <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said it was a `` fair question'' whether all the remaining bodies will ever be found. Six local residents listed as missing have been located alive and one other has been confirmed as dead, <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said. That leaves 10 townspeople still listed as missing. He said police also believed the occupants of only two cars destroyed in the explosion were missing, since what was thought to have been a third car was merely a license plate already in the road when the disaster occurred. Officials earlier had not accounted for occupants of two other cars caught in the inferno, but said Saturday that one driver had been treated for injuries and the other already was on the list of the missing. Searchers extended their hunt to more than 30 miles east of <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION>. Papers, clothing, money and mail from the plane had been found as far away as the <LOCATION> Northumberland </LOCATION> coast, 70 miles east of the main crash site. Investigators were examining the flight's cockpit recording, which ended with what they called a brief, mysterious `` faint noise.'' Suspicions of sabotage were prompted by the inexplicable sudden breakup of the plane at 31,000 feet, a claim of responsibility and disclosures that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government had been warned of a plot to bomb a <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> flight between <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> in December. Passengers and luggage of Flight 103 originated on a <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727 in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> and switched to a <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. The plane was bound for <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> when it crashed. But British aviation authorities, who are leading the crash probe, say the cause still is unknown and there is no evidence to suggest a bomb blew up the plane. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, meanwhile, two <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>'s station chief in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, was on the flight. One of the two officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said there was no indication the station chief's presence was connected to the crash. The <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> official was not identified. The mourning continued throughout Christmas Eve in the village. Christmas `` is really the furthest thing from my mind right now. It's not important,'' said <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Horgan </PERSON>, an American who had come to the village, where a relative had died in Wednesday night's crash. <PERSON> Horgan </PERSON>, one of about 20 people who lost loved ones and came to the crash scene in southwestern <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, met briefly with reporters Saturday on condition that his hometown and any details about his relative on the flight not be disclosed. Beneath the fanciful turreted tower of the town hall, a growing pile of flowers testified to grief. One of the three dozen bunches, including Christmas holly, that had been placed there said: `` God bless you <PERSON> Melina </PERSON>. We love you always. Your father and mother.'' A notice board carried condolences from Prince <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> and Princess <PERSON> Diana </PERSON>, and from President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Queen </PERSON> <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> broadcast an unprecedented second Christmas message Saturday to comfort those who suffered in the <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> jet crash, the Dec. 7 earthquake in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> and the Dec. 12 rail crash in south <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> that killed 34 people. She offered prayers and sympathy to the injured and bereaved and said she hoped `` the eternal message of Christmas will bring some comfort in the hour of sadness.''

 The <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>'s station chief in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, was among the 258 people aboard the Pan American jumbo jet that exploded and crashed in <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, two <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said Saturday. But there is no known reason to believe that he was a specific target of terrorists or that his presence on Flight 103 was tied in any other way to the disaster, one of the officials told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. `` I do n't know of any specific link,'' the official said. For the record, the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration declined to verify or deny that the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> agent was aboard the jetliner, as initially reported by <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>. `` As you know, we never comment on any such allegation having to do with intelligence,'' <PERSON> Sondra </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarty </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman, said. But two other <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials, who spoke on condition of anonymity, confirmed the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> station chief was on the ill-fated flight from <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Heathrow </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. The two would not identify the station chief. American, British, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Interpol </ORGANIZATION> investigators are trying to determine whether the plane was the victim of sabotage, technical malfunction or high winds. All aboard perished and 20 people who resided near the crash site were missing and believed dead. Flight recorders recovered from the wreckage on Friday showed the pilots engaged in routine conversation, with no warning signs apparent before the Wednesday night crash. The tape ended abruptly with a short, faint noise. The loss of the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> station chief in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> is the latest setback to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence operations in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. In April 1983, a terrorist bomb that wrecked the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> took the lives of a number of <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> agents. In 1984, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Buckley </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> station chief, was kidnapped, tortured and killed, probably the next year. The impact on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence-gathering and information about American hostages was immeasurable. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> lists nine Americans currently as hostages. Officials on Thursday denied reports any of the victims in the crash had been engaged in negotiations to secure their freedom. A little more than two weeks before the crash, a caller identifying himself with the radical Palestinian <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON> group telephoned a warning to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> that a <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> passenger jet bound from <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> via <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> would be attacked. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday it sent out a security alert. Still, some <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials complained privately that insufficient precautions were taken and that servicemen traveling home for the holidays had not been informed. After the crash, several callers to news organizations claimed their groups were responsible for the attack. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> operates on a scaled-down basis because of the intermittent strife in the country among rival groups. It is not unusual for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government to assign a <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> official to such a sensitive post. <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> agents in the past have been the targets of extremists. In an effort to shield them, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> in 1975 ceased publishing the names of employees at <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> embassies.

 They sliced prices to trim hair at the <ORGANIZATION> Drake </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barbershop </ORGANIZATION>, a place some say is a real cut above. With a barbershop quartet harmonizing `` Easy Street'' and champagne chilling nearby, <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Merchant </PERSON> was cutting the customer's hair for the 1920s prices of 35 cents on Christmas Eve `` It's our way to commemorate the anniversary of the Drake Hotel and the barbershop,'' Merchant said. His small but classy barbershop, with its mirrors trimmed with gold paint and his barbers in white jackets and ties, is located in the arcade under the venerable, upper-crust hotel on this city's Magnificant Mile Merchant's shop charged the rates when the barbershop and hotel opened in 1920 _ 35 cents for a haircut, 25 cents for a manicure and 10 cents for a shoeshine. `` It's back to the days when a gentleman could get a haircut, a shave, manicure _ the works for under a buck,'' said Merchant. `` I found out the original prices from a 102-year-old man whose hair I cut. He used to come here in the 1920s.'' That's quite a contrast to today's <PERSON> Drake </PERSON> <PERSON> Barbershop </PERSON>, where a haircut costs $ 16 and a manicure goes for $ 12.

<TEXT>
 A newly active volcano in northern <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> erupted again Saturday night and early Sunday, forcing about 250 residents and tourists to evacuate from nearby ski areas and hot spring resorts, police said. Police officials said no casualties or damage were reported in the eruption of 6,900-foot <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tokachi </LOCATION>, about 560 miles north of <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. The volcano first erupted Monday for the first time in 26 years, sending columns of smoke rising more than a mile high and pouring mud down its slopes. Local town officials said the volcano remained relatively calm until its eruptions Saturday. The mud flow caused by the latest eruptions was reported subsiding Sunday morning, police said. However, the <LOCATION> Asahikawa </LOCATION> Weather Observation Station warned local residents Sunday that the volcano could erupt again. In 1926, heat from <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tokachi </LOCATION>'s eruption melted almost all snow on the mountain, causing mudslides that killed 144 people and injured another 200 in two nearby villages. A smaller eruption in 1962 killed four people.

 Gov. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mickelson </PERSON> was thrown off a snowmobile Saturday when he dropped into a 10-foot-deep ravine, and he was hospitalized in serious condition, officials said. <PERSON> Mickelson </PERSON>, 47, suffered a broken collarbone and four broken ribs when his snowmobile dropped into a ravine and he was thrown off, press aide <PERSON> Gretchen </PERSON> <PERSON> Lord </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said. `` There's a bruise on his lung, but it's not punctured.

Although <PERSON> Mickelson </PERSON> was listed in serious condition, his doctor expects him to improve, <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> telephoned Christmas greetings to members of the armed forces serving abroad Saturday and lamented the crash of a <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> jumbo jet in <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> as `` a tragedy words can hardly describe.'' The president, who is vacationing at the home where he and first lady <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> will live after he leaves office Jan. 20, also received thanks from an official in <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, for his expression of condolence to people in the community where the plane crashed. `` On behalf of the people of <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION> I think you and the first lady for your kind wishes at this time of sorrow,'' <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> Park </PERSON>, the convenor of the <LOCATION> Annandale </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Eskdale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, wrote to the president. `` Our small community has suffered much, but our sadness is even greater when we think of the loss of so many people from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Our thoughts are with their friends and relatives wherever they may be.'' One of the servicemen <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> called, Petty Officer 1st Class <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Redshaw </PERSON>, boatswain's mate on a <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> patrol boat based in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, is an English-born naturalized American. `` I noticed you were born in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and both countries this weekend are saddened by a tragedy words can hardly describe,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told <PERSON> Redshaw </PERSON>. `` The sorrow and loss for so many weighs on our hearts and I can only pray that the spirit of peace which is Christmas will find its way to comfort all of us.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> also telephoned Specialist <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Skezas </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Bonita </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, a soldier on duty with the <ORGANIZATION> Multinational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> and Observer Detachment in <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Sinai </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Desert </LOCATION>; Airman 1st Class <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, a food service specialist at <ORGANIZATION> Shemya </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>; and <PERSON> Lance </PERSON> <PERSON> Cpl </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jeffery </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tidey </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Trenton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> radio operator on duty in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. He planned to call a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> seaman in the <LOCATION> Far </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> later in the day. Later, when it was a more convenient hour in the <LOCATION> Far </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, the president telephoned Christmas greetings to <PERSON> Seaman </PERSON> <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Blocker </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, a sailor in charge of the ward room mess on the U.S.S. <LOCATION> Oldendorf </LOCATION>, based out of <LOCATION> Yokosuka </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. He told all of the servicemen, `` We deeply appreciate your service. It's a sacrifice we recognize _ especially to be away from home at Christmas. Please tell your fellow soliders we are thinking of them. Our Christmases are brighter and better because of what you're doing on the frontiers of freedom, making it safer for everyone here at home. God bless you. Carry on.'' Earlier, the president extended special Christmas remembrances to homeless children in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and to victims of the earthquake in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>. Although the president's talk was taped on Thursday, after the Pan-American jumbo jet crash in <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, he made no mention in his broadcast of the crash, which killed all 258 passengers and crew and a score of others on the ground. <PERSON> Leslye </PERSON> <PERSON> Arsht </PERSON>, deputy White House press secretary, said the crash was `` very much of the president's mind'' but he did not mention it in the speech because it was taped within 24 hours of the accident as events were still unfolding. In a statement at the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> on Friday, just before he left for a two-week <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> vacation, the president expressed `` our sorrow and our concern for the families and friends of those who died in the crash of the Pan American Flight 103.'' In his radio speech, the president said `` here in our country, there are children _ without homes, suffering from dire diseases _ whose Christmases will be makeshift at best.'' He praised the efforts of Toys for Tots and other organizations to provide gifts and other assistance for such children. Ms. <PERSON> Arsht </PERSON> was asked if the remark was an attempt to soften the impact of an <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> television interview, taped Wednesday and broadcast Thursday night, in which the president said that some homeless people sleep on the grass and on grates by `` their own choice'' instead of going to shelters. `` No,'' she said. Speaking of the Armenian earthquake, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said, `` We have been witness to the breathtaking bravery of the people of <LOCATION> Leninakan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Spitak </LOCATION> as they ready themselves for the task of going on.'' He also said that at such a time, `` Closed borders open. Friends and enemies alike share the burden and hope to help. From <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and war-torn <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> alike, supplies and aid have been sent to Soviet <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>. And from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> the response has been staggering.'' The White House said the president's son, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON>, his wife, <PERSON> Colleen </PERSON>, and their two children were visiting the president and first lady <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> at their new home here Saturday. The Reagans were having a traditional Christmas eve dinner at the home of <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Z. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wick </PERSON>, the outgoing director of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, and his wife. On Sunday, they plan a Christmas dinner at home, with the president's daughter, <PERSON> Maureen </PERSON>; her husband, <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Revell </PERSON>; the <ORGANIZATION> Reagans </ORGANIZATION>' son, <PERSON> Ron </PERSON>; and his wife, <PERSON> Doria </PERSON>. Mrs. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has said that she and her husband were giving each other items for the house as gifts.

 The spirit of Christmas made a comeback in Peking and <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION>, while Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> II and Queen <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> invoked the holiday to denounce the evil of modern times and comfort those afflicted by recent catastrophes. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> telephoned Christmas greetings to members of the armed forces in distant places Saturday, talking to several selected servicemen from <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> to the <LOCATION> Far </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, increasing numbers of foreign tourists and more exposure to foreign books and television has helped foster what one <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> newspaper called `` Christmas fever.'' Hotels for foreigners mounted Christmas displays and people bought up Christmas cards imported from <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>. In their latest fad, Chinese university students raised on atheism went church-hopping Christmas Eve, and thousands of them jammed <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>'s main Protestant and <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> churches Saturday night In the black township of <LOCATION> Soweto </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, people prepared to enjoy a day clouded in recent years by black activists' calls for `` Black Christmas'' boycotts to protest the white minority government. This year no boycotts were announced and people bought toys, sent Christmas cards, and filled holiday shopping bags without fear of reprisals for breaking a boycott. In <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> at <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peter </LOCATION><LOCATION> 's </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Basilica </LOCATION>, the pope heralded the birth of Christ and lamented the `` evil which still persists in human history and even, in a sense, is becoming deeper and more widespread.'' In parts of the world riven by recent disasters, the holiday supplied only a bare glimmer of hope. In <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, where <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> Flight 103 crashed Wednesday and killed all 258 board as well as others on the ground, shops remained open and churches held Christmas Eve services. Yet hearts grieved as searchers combed the countryside for more bodies. The Rev. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Keegans </PERSON>, whose home was destroyed in the crash, put Christmas preparations aside Saturday to meet with relatives of victims at a counseling center in the Roman Catholic parish hall. In <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>, where a Dec. 7 earthquake killed an estimated 55,000 people, a teacher said even the holiday season could do little to provide solace. `` For us Armenians, there can be no holidays this year. No New Year's, no Christmas,'' said <PERSON> Edik </PERSON> <PERSON> Kasparyan </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Leninakan </LOCATION> teacher. `` There has been too much loss, too much death.'' In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Queen </PERSON> <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> broadcast an unprecedented second Christmas message Saturday to comfort those who suffered in the <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> jet disaster, the Armenian earthquake and a recent rail crash in south <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> that killed 34 people. She said she wanted to offer her heartfelt sympathy and prayers to those who were injured and lost loved ones in the three disasters which `` shocked and distressed'' the entire world. Elsewhere, Christmas competed with social strife. In the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> is said to have been born, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers seemed to outnumber celebrants Saturday. A driving rain, a Palestinian general strike and heavy <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> security kept crowds slim. In <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, friends and relatives of American hostages <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Sutherland </PERSON> and British captive <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> hoped the season would soften the hearts of the kidnappers. They appealed for the release of the hostages in Christmas letters published Saturday in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> newspapers. Despite social turmoil, terror, and disasters both manmade and natural, millions of children around the world felt the magic of Christmas with an innocence many of their elders lost long, long ago. In a <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> apartment on Saturday, the eyes of a 5-year-old girl named <PERSON> Olga </PERSON> lit up when a couple dressed as Ded <PERSON> Moroz </PERSON> and <PERSON> Snegurochka </PERSON>, <PERSON> Grandfather </PERSON> <PERSON> Frost </PERSON> and a snow maiden, walked in. Ded <PERSON> Moroz </PERSON> opened his sack and pulled out a huge teddy bear. `` It's so beautiful,'' said <PERSON> Olga </PERSON>, who was herself dressed as a princess. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, in his pretaped radio speech, extended special Christmas remembrances to homeless children in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and to victims of the earthquake in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>. `` Here in our country, there are children _ without homes, suffering from dire diseases _ whose Christmases will be makeshift at best,'' said the president, who is spending the holidays in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> with wife <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON>. He praised the efforts of Toys for Tots and other organizations to provide gifts and other assistance for such children. In the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, last-minute shoppers thronged shopping malls and last-minute travelers had most airplanes booked solid. At the <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mall </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Toms </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, manager <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> DelBene </PERSON> said the mall's 105 stores were packed with shoppers buying `` just one more thing.'' People were already waiting to get in when the mall opened at 8 a.m., and by noon, the parking lot was full and cars were parked on the grass, <PERSON> DelBene </PERSON> said. `` It gets more hectic every year, as merchants try to beat the prior year's figures. The trend seems to be to wait till the end,'' <PERSON> DelBene </PERSON> said.

But it's kind of hard. He called me that night and I was just overwhelmed. I started crying again on the phone.'' <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>'s mother said she finally reached a <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> official about 9:30 p.m. Wednesday. The official said her son's name was not on the passenger list. `` But you do n't know for sure until you hear that voice on the phone,'' she said. At 12:30 a.m., <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> called his mother in <LOCATION> Ironton </LOCATION>. `` He said ` Mom,' and we both just bawled. He said, ` Mom, I was supposed to be on that plane,''' she said. <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON>, who is stationed on the aircraft carrier USS <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, said he learned of the crash while waiting for his luggage at <LOCATION> Kennedy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` A woman came up and grabbed my arm and said, ` Have you seen my baby? Have you seen my baby?' I had to tell her no, I had n't,'' he said. `` It was very quiet at the airport. All you heard was crying. Nobody was talking.''

 Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> heralded the birth of <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Christ </PERSON> in a midnight Mass homily for Roman Catholics worldwide Saturday, and state-run Italian television said the message was being broadcast to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> for the first time. The pope, dressed in gold and white robes and carrying a crucifix, walked into <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peter </LOCATION>'s Basilica moments before midnight at the end of a long cortege of priests. At the same time, church bells chimed all over <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> to hail the arrival of Christmas. The pope opened the homily in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peter </LOCATION>'s Basilica by quoting from <PERSON> Luke </PERSON> 2:10 -11, `` I bring you good news of great joy for to you is born a savior. A text of the homily was issued in advance by the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>. `` We hear this voice which emanates from the depths of the night of <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION>. The shepherds ` keeping watch over their flock by night' were the first to hear it. For this reason, the midnight liturgy is sometimes called ` the Shepherds' Mass,'' he said. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>, speaking from the papal altar under the colossal bronze canopy designed by <PERSON> Bernini </PERSON>, noted that people of different languages were listening to the same message on radio and television broadcasts of the Mass to 50 countries. The pope, seated on a white and gold throne in front of the altar, spoke to a congregation that included cardinals in red vestments, formally dressed diplomats accredited to the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>, and thousands of pilgrims. An announcer on the state-run <ORGANIZATION> RAI </ORGANIZATION> television network, which was feeding the Mass to other stations and networks around the world, said the message was being broadcast to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> for the first time. He did not elaborate. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has shown signs of overtures to the Roman Catholic church and its domestic faithful in recent months. Earlier this year, officials allowed celebrations to mark the 1,000 anniversary of <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Christendom </LOCATION> and received a delegation from the Vatican. Last year the Soviets stopped jamming the <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, a radio station operated by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government. On Nov. 29, they stopped interfering with signals of U.S.-funded Radio Liberty. In his midnight Mass, the pope cautioned the faithful not to be complacent, and to find the true meaning of Christmas in the words `` a savior is born to you.'' `` It may seem that people have achieved a great deal, and continue to do so, in ` saving' themselves with their own resources, so that they be self-sufficient. But they are becoming more and more convinced that they are not self-sufficient, that all the things that are termed ` civilization, progress and development' do not reach the roots of the evil which still persists in human history and even, in a sense, is becoming deeper and more widespread,'' the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> said. `` Meanwhile the words ` a savior is born to you' continue to touch what is permanent and real in man, what is profoundly true,'' the pontiff said. On Sunday, the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> was to lead a 10:30 a.m. Christmas Day Mass in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peter </LOCATION>'s, the largest church in <LOCATION> Christendom </LOCATION>. That Mass is followed by the pope's traditional Christmas Day message `` Urbi et Orbi,'' to the city and to the world. Earlier Saturday, in what has become a Christmas Eve custom, the <PERSON> pope </PERSON> met with fellow Poles for the breaking of the oplatek, paper-thin unleavened bread similar to wafers used for Communion. Polish families usually begin Christmas Eve dinner by passing the wafer around the table. During the meeting with his countrymen, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>, speaking in Polish, severely criticized what he called `` the evil traditions of the last decades'' in Polish politics.

<TEXT>
 At least seven Christmas Eve slayings pushed the 1988 homicide total to a record with a week left in the year still to go, officials said Saturday. The seven slayings reported by early evening Saturday raised the citywide total for 1988 to 1,842, breaking the record 1981 total of 1,841, said police spokesman Sgt. <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Donnell </PERSON>. On an average day in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, five people are murdered. City officials, both police and elected, have repeatedly blamed drugs and particularly crack for the rise in violence. In all of 1945, the <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> reported 291 homicides; in August 1988 alone, there were 201. Since the crack explosion in 1985, homicides have steadily increased: 1,385 in 1985, 1,582 in 1986, and 1,672 last year. As of last month, Assistant Police Chief <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> said about 42 percent of this year's slayings were drug-related. `` These tragic statistics reflect the mayor's concern expressed over the past 4 -LCB- years that the federal government ought to do something about drugs flooding across our border,'' said mayoral spokesman <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>. The Christmas Eve slayings included a 40-year-old man stabbed to death in his East Village apartment; an unidentified man shot once over the eye in drug-plagued <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heights </LOCATION>; a 21-year-old man fatally shot after a dispute in a <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> nightclub; and a 36-year-old woman found stabbed to death in her <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> apartment. On Friday, shoppers at a <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> department store were sent diving for cover during a shootout between teen-agers that left one dead and three wounded. The gunfight was ignited when one teen-ager bumped another inside the store. The problem is not limited to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>; in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, there has already been a record set for the most homicides ever in a year. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> ranks 10th in killings per 100,000 people, said <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON>. The top three are <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, he said.

 Police stormed a prison and crushed an uprising by inmates who were denied Christmas pardons, but the warden and 23 other people were killed and six were injured in the two-day siege, officials said Saturday. `` There was a fierce gunfight lasting about 15 minutes before the special forces could quell the mutiny'' on Friday night, said police officer <PERSON> Sergio </PERSON> <PERSON> Anzaldo </PERSON>, who was on duty when the commandos attacked the prison. `` It was quite violent,'' he said in a telephone interview. Authorities have arrested four inmates and three prison guards suspected of complicity in the uprising, a state government spokesman said Saturday. One of the arrested guards, hospitalized with minor wounds, was earlier considered one of 20 hostages rescued Friday night when police stormed the prison's administrative offices and crushed the uprising, said <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Flores </PERSON>, a spokesman for <LOCATION> Nayarit </LOCATION> state government. The other two guards were not there during the uprising, but they may have allowed inmates and two outsiders into the office area Thursday morning, the state official said. <PERSON> Anzaldo </PERSON> said 130 commandos flown in from <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> stormed the prison after a group of inmates had held 14 prison employees and visiting relatives hostage for 32 hours. An earlier attempt to storm the prison Friday was repulsed. The uprising began Thursday after the mutinous prisoners were denied pardons given at Christmas to inmates with good behavior. <PERSON> Flores </PERSON> said a preliminary report showed the mutiny began when about six inmates arrived at the warden's office Thursday to protest denial of the pardons. Two well-dressed visitors posing as lawyers approached the building at the same time and took out guns. <PERSON> Flores </PERSON> said they had entered the prison without being searched. The hostages were held in administrative offices, and the rest of the 1,200 inmates remained under control throughout the uprising on the outskirts of <LOCATION> Tepic </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Nayarit </LOCATION> state capital, 500 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. The death toll from the original confrontation Thursday morning and the raids Friday night was 24: <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Alvarado </PERSON>, the 31-year-old warden of <PERSON> Venustiano </PERSON> <PERSON> Carranza </PERSON> penitentiary; <PERSON> Jorge </PERSON> <PERSON> Armando </PERSON> <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON>, head of the Fox commando unit; 19 prisoners and three unidentified people presumed to be prisoners, <PERSON> Flores </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Alvarado </PERSON> was killed in a shootout when the inmates tried to seize the warden's office Thursday, officials said. He was reported to have bled to death from a leg wound. Authorities were still trying to determine exactly how many inmates were ultimately involved in the uprising and how the firearms were brought into the prison. <PERSON> Celso </PERSON> <PERSON> Humberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Delgado </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON>, governor of the state of <LOCATION> Nayarit </LOCATION>, told reporters Saturday that the immediate deployment of 200 state police had kept hundreds of visiting relatives and officials from being trapped by the uprising, but some relatives were among the hostages. <PERSON> Anzaldo </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> volunteers recovered the bodies after the assault and were not immediately sure about their identities. A prisoner provided initial identifications. <PERSON> Duarte </PERSON> was shot shortly before nightfall Friday, when he went into the prison compound and tried to talk the inmates into surrendering. `` The answer was a hail of bullets which killed him instantly,'' a state official said. About two hours later, police lobbed dozens of tear gas canisters into the penitentiary and rushed it with automatic weapons blazing. An undetermined number of people died in the raid, which was unsuccessful. About 11 p.m. Friday the commandos staged a second raid, which killed more people and succeeded, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. At least two people besides the prison warden and commando leader were killed before special forces stormed the inmates, he said. <PERSON> Anzaldo </PERSON> said the prison's security force had been doubled and reinforced with special police.

 Lottery players had visions of dollar signs dancing in their heads on Christmas Eve and kept machines across the state humming late Saturday, including one spot that has become something of a lottery shrine. The Liquor Rack, in the southeastern town of <LOCATION> Robinson </LOCATION>, has earned its reputation as a lucky lottery outlet after selling winning tickets four times. With an estimated $ 37 million grand prize on the line Saturday, the third largest ever offered in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, many lottery players made a special pilgrimage to the store. The winning numbers picked Saturday evening were 8, 9, 27, 33, 43 and 54. Lottery officials said they wo n't announce whether anyone matched all six numbers until Sunday. And because of the holiday, the validation of winners, if there are any, will wait until Tuesday. `` They're hanging out the door,'' said <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilkin </PERSON>, owner of The Liquor Rack. `` We ca n't give the thing -LRB- machine -RRB- a break.'' The business that sells the winning ticket receives a bonus equal to 1 percent of the winnings. Of <PERSON> Wilkin </PERSON>'s four bonuses, the last two came only a month apart, in July and August. `` Everybody on the road stops to see us,'' said <PERSON> Wilkin </PERSON>. `` We had a few people come down from <LOCATION> Champaign </LOCATION> -LRB- 100 miles away -RRB- just to pick up their tickets.'' State lottery spokeswoman <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Rem </PERSON> was n't surprised. With average sales of 1 million tickets an hour since early Saturday morning, she said most ticket outlets were likely very busy. `` We were n't sure how we'd do on Christmas Eve, but I guess the public has answered that question,'' she said. `` Business is booming.'' The $ 37 million prize is the result of three previous weekend drawings without any player matching all six numbers drawn from among 54 possible. While the state lottery guarantees $ 5 million for each weekend drawing and rolls that amount over, the big increases come when there are more than the usual number of tickets sold. Business also was brisk at Doc's Liquor Store, the northwest <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> suburban shop owned by <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Wittkowski </PERSON>, the one-time printer who won the largest-ever prize of $ 40 million four years ago. `` <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> still plays, but I do n't know whether he's playing this one or not It seems like everybody else is though,'' said <PERSON> Dino </PERSON> <PERSON> Pappas </PERSON>, <PERSON> Wittkowski </PERSON>'s brother-in-law and the manager of the store. `` Sales are big. Real big.'' The second-largest <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> prize of $ 39 million was claimed Nov. 5 by former state Rep. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Soper </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Cicero </LOCATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Rem </PERSON> said there has also been a $ 35 million jackpot, but that was shared by several winners.

 A <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> terrorist group said Saturday it will free two <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> girls held hostage for more than a year, in response to an appeal by <LOCATION> Libyan </LOCATION> leader Col. <PERSON> Moammar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> that captives be released. A statement issued by the <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, led by <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON>, said the girls to be released are the daughters of French hostage <PERSON> Jacqueline </PERSON> <PERSON> Valente </PERSON>. They are Marie-Laure, 7, and <PERSON> Virginie </PERSON>, 6. The council's statement also called for release of all kidnapped hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, `` especially those uninvolved in any espionage activity or those serving with humanitarian organizations.'' The group's announcement was released a few hours after Ms. <PERSON> Valente </PERSON>'s mother, former husband and brother-in-law arrived in west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> to press for their relatives' freedom. The statement set no date for their release. But the group's spokesman, <PERSON> Walid </PERSON> <PERSON> Khaled </PERSON>, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> the two girls were to be freed within 24 hours <PERSON> Khaled </PERSON> said in November last year that his group captured the three, along with five Belgians, from a <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> boat it seized off the coast of the Israeli-occupied <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. He accused the adults of being Israeli spies, which their relatives deny. `` In light of the appeal made by brother <PERSON> Moammar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> on the occasion of Christmas and New Year for the release of the hostages, especially the two girls, Marie-Laure and <PERSON> Virginie </PERSON>, our <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> has decided to free the two girls within the framework of specific security arrangements set for this purpose,'' the statement said. In April, the group offered to release Ms. <PERSON> Valente </PERSON>'s older daughters, but <PERSON> Khaled </PERSON> said their mother refused to let them go. The statement, released in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, did not spell out the security arrangements involved, nor did it indicate the captives' whereabouts But it said <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> pledged to `` extend all the necessary facilities that will guarantee the safety of the two girls.'' The captives are widely believed held in the Palestinian refugee camp of <PERSON> Ein </PERSON> el-Hilweh outside the southern port of <LOCATION> Sidon </LOCATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Valente </PERSON>'s brother-in-law, <PERSON> Andre </PERSON> <PERSON> Metral </PERSON>, said after the statement was released that <PERSON> Khaled </PERSON> contacted him at the Cavalier Hotel in west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> and told him he wanted to see him, without setting an exact date for the meeting. But <PERSON> Metral </PERSON> said the meeting would most probably take place sometime Sunday and that <PERSON> Khaled </PERSON> had warned him that he does not want any reporters present. Ms. <PERSON> Valente </PERSON>, her daughters and the five Belgians have been called the `` forgotten hostages'' by the <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> media, since they are not among 15 foreign hostages most commonly mentioned in press reports. Ms. <PERSON> Valente </PERSON> gave birth to a third daughter in captivity and is reportedly expecting a fourth child. The French and Belgians have been held for more than a year by <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, a radical guerrilla group led by Palestinian terrorist <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON>.

A former official of <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION>, a faction led by <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>, <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON> split with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> in the early 1970s. The <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revolutionary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> is not part of the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. The statement's call for release of hostages doing humanitarian work or those not involved in espionage appeared to refer to Belgian doctor <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Cools </PERSON>, 32, who disappeared May 21 after leaving his apartment in the <LOCATION> Rashidiyeh </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> refugee camp near <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s southern port of Tyre Cools worked for the Norwegian Norwac humanitarian organization for three months before he vanished. A previously unknown group calling itself `` The Soldiers of Justice'' claimed responsibility for his abduction Dec. 18. With the statement, the <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Nidal </PERSON> group was apparently trying to distance itself from the death threats that led the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> to suspend services and evacuate all Swiss personnel from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> this week.

Also Saturday, friends and relatives of American hostages <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Sutherland </PERSON> and British captive <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> appealed for their release in Christmas letters published in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> newspapers. The U.S.-based Journalists' Committee to Free <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> called on pro-Iranian Shiite Moslem extremists to free him and <PERSON> Sutherland </PERSON> `` in the name of humanity.'' The two Americans are among 15 Westerners missing in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sutherland </PERSON> are believed held by a pro-Iranian <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> group known as the Islamic Jihad, or Holy War. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, 41, the chief <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> correspondent for <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, is the longest-held of the hostages.

 No bones about it, <PERSON> Josephine </PERSON> <PERSON> Mattson </PERSON>'s Christmas tree, covered from tip to trunk with 525 gold-painted wishbones, is one of a kind `` It's different,'' said <PERSON> Mattson </PERSON>, a retired occupational therapist. `` People seem to enjoy it. They've never heard of a wishbone tree.'' <PERSON> Mattson </PERSON>'s wishbones are no paltry poultry collection, either. Although it includes the usual chicken and <LOCATION> turkey </LOCATION> bones, it also has fragile pheasant, quail and pigeon wishbones, tiny as thimbles. One comes from a golden eagle, she said. Some date back decades, including the wishbone from the eagle, which was handed down from a friend's grandfather. The golden eagles are now protected from hunters. The collection started when <PERSON> Mattson </PERSON>'s father established a poultry farm in the 1930s. Her mother kept chicken, <LOCATION> turkey </LOCATION>, geese and duck wishbones from family dinners on a shelf in the family kitchen. The collection took off from there, said <PERSON> Mattson </PERSON>. After a <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> newspaper reported on the tree some 30 years ago, <PERSON> Mattson </PERSON> was showered with wishbones from well-wishers. The tree is topped by a big turkey wishbone turned upside down with a bell suspended from the prongs. <PERSON> Mattson </PERSON> says the turkey wishbone from this year's Christmas dinner will hang to one side of the golden eagle wishbone, making a wish for a happy new year.

<TEXT>
 Carols filtered through loudspeakers and drifted across <LOCATION> Manger </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>, but few Christmas Eve pilgrims were on hand to hear them in this biblical town, where soldiers seemed to outnumber celebrants. A driving rain, a Palestinian general strike and heavy <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> security kept crowds slim. As darkness fell, troops with automatic rifles stood guard on rooftops, including that of the Church of the Nativity, which marks the site where <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Christ </PERSON> is said to have been born. The few visitors who spent the afternoon in <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION> huddled under Manger Square's arcade, outside shops closed down by striking Palestinians. In other parts of the Israeli-occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, five Palestinians were reported wounded, one in a clash with troops and four in a clash with an Arab village official accused of collaborating with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> reports said. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio quoted security sources as saying a family feud was behind the incident. Two Arabs also died and three others were wounded as they `` handled an explosive device'' in the small West bank village of <PERSON> Marj </PERSON> <PERSON> en </PERSON> <PERSON> Naja </PERSON>, an army spokesman said. The army had no further details. <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION> was quiet. Arab municipal officials canceled the traditional Christmas parade in an expression of solidarity with the year-old uprising against Israeli rule in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. Slogans written on <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION> walls by the uprising's PLO-backed leadership ordered Palestinians to stay at home. But Israeli authorities went ahead with a choir concert before midnight Mass in St. <PERSON> Catherine </PERSON>'s Church. Several hundred tourists and <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> pilgrims attended the performance, but the number was a considerable drop from the thousands who normally attend. `` Silent Night,'' sung in German and English by the Pueri Youth Chorus from <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> opened the concert. Also on the program was another Swiss choir, two choirs from <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> and one from the <ORGANIZATION> Shiloh </ORGANIZATION> baptist church in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, which sang `` Let My People Go.'' The choir director, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fleming </PERSON>, said the song was chosen to speak out for freedom from oppression all over the world. `` The idea is that people should be free. <PERSON> Christ </PERSON> came to bring us that freedom,'' he said. Official ceremonies began Saturday with the arrival of <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Sabbah </PERSON>, the bishop of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, in the afternoon. <PERSON> Sabbah </PERSON>, the Roman Catholic patriarch of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, was greeted in <LOCATION> Manger </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION> by the <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> military governor of <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION>, Lt. Col. <PERSON> Shaltiel </PERSON> <PERSON> Levy </PERSON>, and the city's mayor, <PERSON> Elias </PERSON> <PERSON> Freij </PERSON>. The visitors and pilgrims who watched the bishop arrive near the Mosque of <PERSON> Omar </PERSON> were far outnumbered by journalists and hundreds of <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> police, troops and plainclothes officers. A leaflet issued earlier this week by the PLO-backed underground leaders of the uprising called for a general strike on Christmas Eve, and complained of <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> participation in the Christian ceremonies. But <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> officials said they felt it was important to maintain the practice _ more than a century old _ in which rulers of the region greet church leaders as a symbol of the protection offered to minority Christians in the largely Moslem <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. The practice was followed by the British and Turkish rulers of <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Sabbah </PERSON>, who is the first Palestinian appointed bishop of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, was led into the church by traditional Moslem guards wearing red fezzes and carrying curved swords. Hundreds of people crowded into the church to attend after strict searches by Israeli security guards. More than 100 stood outside in the rain to watch the mass on a large screen set up on the wall of the Manger Square police station. Holy water was sprinkled at the doorway of the Church of the Nativity as the bishop, preceded by altar boys, entered amid a clowd of incense smoke. The midnight Mass, led by <PERSON> Sabbah </PERSON>, is held each year in <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catherine </ORGANIZATION>'s basilica next door because the Church of the Nativity, built over the grotto where <PERSON> Christ </PERSON> was born, is run by the Greek Orthodox church. The Greek Orthodox celebrate Christmas on Jan. 6, the Epiphany. Israeli troops blocked all streets around <LOCATION> Manger </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>, and pilgrims had to walk blocks to reach it. Before they could enter, they had to pass through metal detectors and were searched by Israeli security forces. <PERSON> Virginia </PERSON> <PERSON> Lankton </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Lansing </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, said she did not mind the heavy security because `` I realize it is for my own safety.'' She said her husband died recently and she came to the Holy Land at Christmas to realize a life-long dream. `` I was alone and I thought this was a good place to be, instead of being home alone,'' she said. Father <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Doyle </PERSON>, a Franciscan priest who is assistant rector at the nearby ecumenical institute, said he was discouraged by the deployment of many <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers and police around Manger Square. `` It's extremely depressing to see something like this the day before we celebrate the birth of the Prince of Peace,'' said the Philadelphia-born priest. There was no violence in heavily-guarded <LOCATION> Bethlehem </LOCATION>, but in <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, 25 miles north, a 21-year-old <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> man who was shot in the head by soldiers last week died of his wounds Saturday. <PERSON> Doyle </PERSON> said he thought most Arab Christians from the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> would probably not attend midnight Mass because of the heavy security, but likely would fill the church on Christmas morning. About 35,000 Palestinan Christians live in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>, which <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> captured in the the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. At least 334 Palestinians have been killed during the revolt. Fourteen Israelis also have been killed.

 Federal drug agents seized 330 pounds of cocaine Saturday in the latest action against <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s notorious <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> drug cartel, officials said. A 39-year-old Cuban national also was arrested in the raid, dubbed `` Operation Christmas Cola,'' said <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Lochridge </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. He estimated the shipment was worth $ 5 million. `` During the holiday season, drug traffickers attempt to evade detection from law enforcement officials by moving large quantities of drugs based on their belief that during the Christmas season there are fewer agents on duty to catch them,'' <PERSON> Lochridge </PERSON> said. `` Not so for this smuggling operation. It was definitely a white Christmas for the feds.'' The Cuban national, <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Alcorta </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, was booked for investigation of possession of cocaine for distribution and sale, <PERSON> Lochridge </PERSON> said. He was arrested in the city of <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>, about eight miles southeast of downtown, after allegedly loading boxes containing the cocaine into a refrigerated semi-tractor trailer, said <PERSON> Lochridge </PERSON>. The seizure was part of a continuing effort by a <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> task force, <PERSON> Lochridge </PERSON> said.

 A storm-spawned tornado swept through two of <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION>'s southern suburbs just after dawn Saturday, killing one person, injuring 15 and destroying 20 buildings in a three-mile-long path. As many as eight twisters were reported in the <LOCATION> Franklin </LOCATION> area shortly after 6 a.m., according to the <ORGANIZATION> Tennessee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, but only one apparently was responsible for the destruction in <LOCATION> Franklin </LOCATION> and neighboring <LOCATION> Brentwood </LOCATION>. The tornado, which cut a swath about three miles long by 50 yards wide, destroyed 15 houses and damaged 40 others, and five commercial buildings were toppled and six more damaged, said <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Newton </PERSON>, the agency's chief of operations. Damage to residences not including the belongings inside was estimated at $ 3 million, said <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, emergency management director for <LOCATION> Williamson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. `` I'm glad that you're talking to me instead of writing my obituary,'' said <PERSON> Hardy </PERSON> <PERSON> Britton </PERSON>, whose wife suffered only minor injuries after she was sucked through a shattered window of their frame house and hurled at least 20 or 30 yards into an open field. Not a single piece of furniture remained intact in <PERSON> Britton </PERSON>'s home, but he and his two daughters were uninjured The threat of tornadoes moved eastward with the passage of a line of intense thunderstorms, leaving residents to face Christmas with ruined homes and cars and streets littered with torn-apart trees and shards of wood, metal and insulation. A number of planes at the local airport also were destroyed, said Lt. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Harper </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Franklin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Rice </PERSON>, 67, was dead on arrival at <ORGANIZATION> Williamson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, 20 miles south of <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION>, where 15 people injured in the storm were taken, said nursing supervisor <PERSON> Arvemia </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilburn </PERSON>. All were treated and released except one, <PERSON> Lucy </PERSON> <PERSON> McClearon </PERSON> of College Grove, who was listed in stable condition, she said. Most residents were sleeping or just waking up when the storm hit. `` All I know is I got up and got myself a cup of coffee,'' <PERSON> Britton </PERSON> said. `` I heard two fast whistles -LRB- of wind -RRB- and that was it. I was blown off my feet.'' <PERSON> Britton </PERSON>'s neighbor, <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, said, `` It was just like a train going through the house, a lot of wind and it was whistling real loud and glass was flying everywhere.'' Mrs. <PERSON> White </PERSON>'s brick frame home was heavily damaged, but she, her husband and their two sons were unhurt.

 Lawyer <PERSON> Alton </PERSON> <PERSON> Maddox </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said Saturday he would appeal a $ 1,000 fine imposed on him for filing a baseless complaint of racism in the state's court system. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Mukasey </PERSON> found in July that <PERSON> Maddox </PERSON>'s complaint had no basis In a ruling released Friday by the state, he denied a request by <PERSON> Maddox </PERSON>, who represented controversial teen-ager <PERSON> Tawana </PERSON> <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON>, to reconsider the fine and ordered the penalty. <PERSON> Maddox </PERSON>, who is black, complained in the suit that he had to apply for permission to represent an indigent defendant while a white lawyer received such an appointment without applying first. The state presented evidence that the white lawyer had to apply as well, <PERSON> Mukasey </PERSON> said. The judge, who noted that the state panel that disciplines lawyers was reviewing the case, ordered <PERSON> Maddox </PERSON> to pay the state legal costs of $ 1,000. <PERSON> Maddox </PERSON> charged Saturday that the judge also was biased against him. He said <PERSON> Mukasey </PERSON> once was a law partner with now-U.S. Attorney <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON>, whom <PERSON> Maddox </PERSON> said `` has absolute hatred of myself.'' `` The only rationale that anybody can apply to this ruling is that this judge is obviously biased because of his relationship with <PERSON> Rudy </PERSON> <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Maddox </PERSON> said. The courthouse was closed Saturday and <PERSON> Mukasey </PERSON> could not be reached for comment. Ms. <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON>, who is black, touched off a nationwide controversy after claiming she had been abducted and sexually assaulted for several days by up to six white men, including one who flashed a police badge. She and her family, however, refused to cooperate with state investigators on the advice of <PERSON> Maddox </PERSON>, another lawyer, <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON>, and the Rev. <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharpton </PERSON>.

 A barge that lost 70,000 gallons of oil off the southwestern <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> coast was towed into port Saturday after a leak was plugged, while volunteers cleaned up oil-coated birds left in its wake. `` I've heard people mutter ` Merry Christmas,' but I do n't think they meant it,'' said <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conservation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION>, one of those who looked for injured birds on the beach. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Holcomb </PERSON> of the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ecology </ORGANIZATION> said more than 300 birds were brought in Saturday for cleaning at a rescue station set up in a church in nearby <LOCATION> Hoquiam </LOCATION>, but 130 were found dead or could not be saved. Sixty birds were found dead Friday night, officials said. Crews stopped working late Saturday, but planned to resume efforts early Sunday morning, <PERSON> Holcomb </PERSON> said. There were encouraging reports that some of the oil was dissipating in the ocean, he said. <PERSON> Holcomb </PERSON> said oil came ashore along a three-mile stretch of ocean beach on the jetty at the north entrance to <LOCATION> Grays </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> northward to <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Shores </LOCATION>. There were reports of oil-covered birds as far north as <LOCATION> Moclips </LOCATION>, 15 miles north of here, and a few from south of the <LOCATION> Grays </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> entrance, said <PERSON> Holcomb </PERSON>. He said the birds were open-ocean birds, mostly common murres, and came ashore only because they were stricken by the spill. There was no telling how many birds were harmed, he said. The barge, loaded with 2.7 million gallons of heavy oil, began leaking Thursday night after it was struck by the tug towing it. Just one tank, which held 250,000 gallons, was affected, and the spill was estimated at 70,000 gallons, officials said. An emergency patch could not be placed on the barge until early Saturday because of rough seas. Oil seeped into <LOCATION> Grays </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> and up the northern part of the inlet as the leaking barge was towed south Friday night to the mouth of the <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Zimmer </PERSON> said that within <LOCATION> Grays </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>, there were traces of oil at the <ORGANIZATION> Oyhut </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Recreation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Area </ORGANIZATION> and heavier concentrations on Sand and Goose islands. The islands are used as resting spots by harbor seals, but there was no immediate evidence any seals were harmed. Meanwhile, the barge arrived at <LOCATION> Astoria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, just inside the mouth of the <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, about midday Saturday, said <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> Lt. Cmdr. <PERSON> Guy </PERSON> <PERSON> Nolan </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, Ore. The level of oil and seawater in the damaged compartment was lowered by pumping to other compartments on the barge, and the temporary patch in the gashed tank was strengthened, <PERSON> Nolan </PERSON> said. Eventually, <PERSON> Nolan </PERSON> said, the barge would be towed to <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION> where it would be drained and a permanent patch installed. The barge is owned by <PERSON> Sause </PERSON> <PERSON> Bros </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Ocean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Towing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Coos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, which hired a company to begin cleanup operations, said <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Lauer </PERSON>, manager of bulk products for <PERSON> Sause </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Sause </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bros. </ORGANIZATION> has operated coastal barges for more than 40 years, said <PERSON> Lauer </PERSON>. He declined to comment on whether the spill was the worst in the company's history.

Tinsel hung in <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION>'s windows and the stores were open for late shoppers. But the heart had gone out of the holiday here. Even holly wreaths bore messages of grief. Christmas `` is really the furthest thing from my mind right now. It's not important,'' said <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Horgan </PERSON>, an American who had come to the village where a relative had died in the crash of <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> Flight 103. At his service, <PERSON> Annand </PERSON> offered prayers for those killed in the disaster and their families and for members of the armed services, police, firemen, ambulance crews and `` all who are enduring long and arduous hours of work in the search for victims.'' Similar prayers were offered at Christmas midnight Mass on Saturday at <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> of the Holy Trinity. Christmas Eve was Day 3 of the search for victims of Wednesday night's crash, which showered this quiet market town with flames and shards of jagged metal. Authorities say all 258 people aboard the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 were killed, and at least 10 townspeople are missing. <PERSON> Horgan </PERSON>, one of about 20 people who lost loved ones and came to the crash scene in southwestern <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, met briefly with reporters Saturday on condition that his hometown and any details about his relative on the flight not be disclosed. He was accompanied by one of the social workers who were assigned to help survivors deal with their feelings. The Rev. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Keegans </PERSON> of the local <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> put Christmas preparations aside Saturday to meet with relatives of the victims who had come to a counseling center in the parish hall. Bright sunshine in the morning gave way to drizzle and then a steady rain in the afternoon as the search for victims and wreckage went on. A half-dozen men stood watchfully opposite town hall, which is being used as a morgue for about half of the bodies recovered so far. One woman walked up and added a bouquet to a pile of cards and flowers, which stood as testimony to the grief. She quickly departed. One bouquet bore a tribute `` to the little girl in the red dress who lies here, who made my flight from <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> such fun. You did n't deserve this. God bless. <PERSON> Chas </PERSON>.'' `` In solidarity from the Armenian earthquake disaster fund,'' said a card. Another came from `` someone who cares in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>.'' A notice board carried condolences from Prince <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> and Princess <PERSON> Diana </PERSON>, and from President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. On the main street of <LOCATION> Lockerbie </LOCATION>, shoppers were out, but not in the numbers expected on Christmas Eve. `` People have n't had the heart to come out,'' said a ruddy-faced, blonde young woman at <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>'s bakery. She shyly but firmly declined to give her name. `` This is a very quiet part of <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>. It's an area that quite has enjoyed its _ I do n't want to say anonymity _ but it's a fairly secret place,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Owen </PERSON>, a Church of <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION> minister from the outlying parish of <PERSON> Loch </PERSON> <PERSON> Maben </PERSON>. `` For a community such as this to find suddenly in our midst so much death, it has an awesome effect,'' <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> said.

 The government has declared a holiday amnesty freeing 26 political prisoners, including a leading journalist, held three months without formal charges, lawyers for the inmates said Saturday. The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> headed by the nation's de facto leader, Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, issued a news release later Saturday confirming their release over the past week and calling it a goodwill gesture. The government says the prisoners had `` acted against state security.'' Among those released was <PERSON> Alberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Conte </PERSON>, president of the Panamanian association of journalists. He was set free early Saturday and flew to <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, his lawyer, <PERSON> Rogelio </PERSON> <PERSON> Cruz </PERSON>, said in a telephone interview. <PERSON> Conte </PERSON> and the other prisoners had illegally been held without trial since September, lawyers for the inmates said. All the released prisoners belong to the Civic Crusade, a coalition of 190 political parties, business and professional groups, and student and labor unions opposed to <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. Most of the prisoners besides <PERSON> Conte </PERSON> also belonged to the opposition Authentic Panamanian Party. The party is a member of the Civic Crusade, which has been agitating for months to force <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to step down as chief of the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION>, a position he uses to control the nation's government <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has been indicted by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> federal grand juries on charges of drug trafficking and money laundering. Earlier this year, the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration froze Panamanian assets in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> banks and imposed economic sanctions against <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> in an unsuccessful effort to oust <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> still recognizes <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> as <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s lawful president. In February, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> allies in the <ORGANIZATION> Legislative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> forced <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> from office and named <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Solis </PERSON> <PERSON> Palma </PERSON> as his successor. In another act of Christmas amnesty, <LOCATION> Solis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Palma </LOCATION> reduced sentences for 240 common criminals without records of drug involvement, officials said. `` The government decision made by the executive follows the Christmas spirit that is in the hearts of the <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> people in commemoration of the birth of the son of God and the start of the new year,'' the Defense Forces news release said.

 Traces of cocaine were discovered in the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> hotel room of a former city employee who was visited by Mayor <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> reported. However, the newspaper, in Sunday's editions, quoted a narcotics officer as saying the test results did not necssarily indicate that drugs were present in the room recently. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> said it was purely coincidental that he visited acquaintance <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> at his hotel room Thursday at about the time police were checking allegations <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> had offered drugs to maids in exchange for sex. `` I would never knowingly associate with with anybody using drugs or dealing with drugs,'' <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> was quoted as saying through a spokesman. `` Under no circumstances would I associate with anybody doing this.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> also reported in Sunday's editions that <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> had visited the hotel at least six times during the past week, including visits during the weekend of Dec. 16-17 and twice on Wednesday. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> said on Friday that he visited acquaintence <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> at his downtown hotel room on Tuesday and Thursday. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> became the focus of a police investigation following several complaints by hotel maids that <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> offered them drugs in exchange for sex. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> released a statement to the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> on Saturday through a spokesman saying that he `` categorically'' did not visit the hotel on Wednesday and `` did not see'' <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> on Dec. 16. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>, however, said he could not remember if he visited <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> at the hotel on Dec. 17. The mayor said through the spokesman that he had met with <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> three times, but could not remember when the third meeting occurred. The <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said that minutes after that conversation, the mayor's spokesman revised his statement to say `` whatever the number of days the mayor says he saw <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, there were never any drugs involved The fact is, he does n't recall every time he saw <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> said through his spokesman that he did not see drugs or paraphernalia in the room, and is not aware of whether <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> sold or used drugs. The paper said <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, 50, was fired from in April from a high-ranking <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> government position after allegations were raised bout his use of government funds in a joint Virgin Islands-city government project. The public integrity branch of the city <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is investigating the response of two police officers who arrived at the hotel following the initial call reporting the alleged drug offers on Thursday. Investigators said the officers left without interviewing or charging <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>. <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> had arrived at <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>' hotel room at about 1 p.m. while the officers were still at the scene, The <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said. The paper reported that sources said <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> has made numerous calls to police officials to find out what they have learned in their investigation. <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, who checked out of the <ORGANIZATION> Ramada </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inn </ORGANIZATION> on Friday, apparently without having been interviewed by police, ran up a $ 1,990.83 bill at the hotel on the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> card of <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Storey </PERSON>, an aide in <PERSON> Barry </PERSON>'s policy office, the <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said. Police said that after <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON> checked out of the hotel, internal affairs detectives barred the room and tested it for drugs. The <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said two unnamed city officials familiar with testing procedures said the results of the drug test were positive.

 <LOCATION> Libyan </LOCATION> leader Col. <PERSON> Moammar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> has denied <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> allegations his country built a chemical weapons plant and accused <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> of escalating a hostile campaign against <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, the official Libyan news agency <ORGANIZATION> JANA </ORGANIZATION> reported Saturday. <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>'s foreign ministry echoed the complaint in a letter Friday to <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> JANA </ORGANIZATION> said. The news agency also reported Saturday that <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> said he would hand over the body of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> pilot killed during the 1986 air raid on <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> ordered by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government has criticized <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> recently, saying it built a huge chemical weapons plant, and <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has said military action against the plant was under consideration. <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> says the factory in question produces pharmaceuticals. <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> made his comments in a letter to the chairman of the non-aligned movement, President <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mugabe </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Zimbabwe </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> JANA </ORGANIZATION> reported without saying when the letter was sent. He urged <PERSON> Mugabe </PERSON> to help counter the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> campaign that he said `` constitutes a threat to international security and peace,'' said <ORGANIZATION> JANA </ORGANIZATION>, monitored in the Italian capital. The letter to <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> sent by the secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liaison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION>, or foreign ministry, reiterated <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>'s `` unequivocal rejection of these groundless claims and allegations,'' the news agency said. The letter also told the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> chief that <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> adheres to international conventions and accords concerning chemical weapons and participates `` in all efforts aimed at banning chemical weapons,'' <ORGANIZATION> JANA </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said in an interview aired Thursday night on <ORGANIZATION> ABC-TV </ORGANIZATION> that military action against the site has been under consideration by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and its allies. But `` that's a decision that has not been made yet,'' he said. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> bombed <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> in 1986 in retaliation for a terrorist attack on a <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> disco that killed a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> serviceman and wounded 204 other people. <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> said the body of pilot Capt. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorence </PERSON> would be given to his family `` through the pope,'' said the agency, monitored in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Lorence </PERSON>, 31, of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> was in an F-111 that disappeared during the April 15, 1986, raid on <LOCATION> Tripoli </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Benghazi </LOCATION>.

 The propane truck that blew up and burned after hitting a retaining wall on a downtown interstate, killing nine people, had passed an inspection just the day before, officials said Saturday. <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> investigators picked over debris from Friday's crash and also checked the records of the truck and driver, who was one of those who died in the crash. The driver had only minor violations on his record and was thoroughly familiar with the route, officials said late Saturday. Eight of the dead were killed as a result of the blast and fire following the accident, including two people injured in their homes who died Saturday at a hospital. A ninth person died in a separate accident in the traffic jam that resulted from the crash, authorities said. A team from the <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> examined the crash site Saturday and tried to recreate the accident, said <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> member <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON>. The initial investigation showed that the truck driven by <PERSON> Randall </PERSON> <PERSON> Benson </PERSON>, 29, of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ark. </LOCATION>, got a roadside inspection Thursday by the <ORGANIZATION> Arkansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> and found free of defects, <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Benson </PERSON>, who worked for <ORGANIZATION> Wooten </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transports </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, had a good driving record and had navigated the route of the accident many times, he said. `` He was thoroughly familiar with the route and with the job he was doing,'' <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON> said. `` Obviously, something happened. We're not ready to say the driver lost control It could have been something else.'' <PERSON> Benson </PERSON> was certified as medically fit to drive hazardous materials and had passed a drug test a year ago, <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON> said. He driving record was clean except for backing into an object and hitting a car while making a right turn. The <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> plans to continue the investigation but estimated the final report is far from complete. <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> experts met Saturday morning `` with the various parties or people who have involvement in this accident and organized the investigation,'' said board spokesman <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Benson </PERSON>. The accident involved `` interstate trucking and hazardous materials and that's why we're concerned about that,'' he said. In addition to studying the records of the trucking company, driver and truck, investigators will examine the layout of the interstate and the response of emergency personnel, he said. `` We'll be looking at probable cause and any safety issues that may have relevance anywhere else in the country,'' <PERSON> Benson </PERSON> said. The 100,000-gallon tanker truck skidded on a 25 mph exit ramp of Interstate 240 in the Midtown section of <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, struck a retaining wall and exploded, said fire department Capt. <PERSON> Benny </PERSON> <PERSON> McDow </PERSON>. The tank shot 125 yards and crashed into a duplex apartment, crushing the building and killing a 10-year-old girl inside. A mammoth fireball set several other houses and nearby cars on fire. <PERSON> Benson </PERSON> said six <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> investigators will head teams of local and state authorities. `` The field phase of the investigation may take up to a week. The entire investigation will take up a minimum of nine months,'' <PERSON> Benson </PERSON> said. `` We go into it very thoroughly.'' Some of the investigators went to the site Friday night to take a preliminary look, and more went to the scene Saturday. The work will continue through the Christmas holiday, said <PERSON> Benson </PERSON>. Besides <PERSON> Benson </PERSON>, the dead included <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, 34, <LOCATION> Brighton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, a motorist; <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wardlow </PERSON>, 40, <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, a motorist; <PERSON> Tina </PERSON> <PERSON> Wiles </PERSON>, 30, <LOCATION> Vicksburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miss. </LOCATION>, a motorist; <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wiles </ORGANIZATION>, 70, <LOCATION> Vicksburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Miss. </LOCATION>, Mrs. <PERSON> Wiles </PERSON>' father-in-law; and <PERSON> Shelanda </PERSON> <PERSON> Towles </PERSON>, 10, killed in her house. <PERSON> Iva </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubesheim </PERSON>, 87, who lived in the other half of the duplex from <LOCATION> Shelanda </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Malone </PERSON>, 57, who lived in another burned home, both died Saturday in the Regional Medical Center. Traffic backed up several miles and a second truck driver, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON>, 29, of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Helena </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ark. </LOCATION>, was killed when his 18-wheeler plowed into the rear of a car tied up in the jam, police said.

Discussing openly problems that once were kept quiet, the <ORGANIZATION> Bishops </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Priestly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said some priests are just going through the motions, and many `` have settled for a part-time presence to their priesthood.'' Part of the priests' morale problem, said the committee of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bishops </ORGANIZATION>, comes from the feeling that they are caught between <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> directives and a <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> laity that is often at odds with <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>. Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> has urged priests to accept suffering as part of their fate, but the American bishops have said that is not helpful and have compiled suggestions on how to improve priests' morale.
