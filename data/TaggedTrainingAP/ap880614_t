<HEAD>Meese's Friend Says He Rejected Leniency Offer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SAN FRANCISCO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> says he refused to testify against his longtime friend, Attorney General <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, in exchange for a government offer of leniency in the <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> influence peddling case. <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>, 54, made the statement in an interview broadcast Tuesday night on <ORGANIZATION> KRON-TV </ORGANIZATION>, an <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> affiliate. <PERSON> KRON </PERSON> said the interview was recorded earlier and that further portions would be broadcast on a Wednesday night news program. The <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> trial lawyer called <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> `` an honorable man'' and said there `` is nothing to talk about'' with prosecutors investigating allegations that <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> improperly used his influence on <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>'s behalf in a proposed Iraqi pipeline deal. <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>, who has known <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> since law school, made the statement about leniency when asked if prosecutors had approached his lawyers to work out a deal. `` Yes, they did,'' <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> KRON </ORGANIZATION> he learned he was about to be indicted on Dec. 22, when <PERSON> Baruch </PERSON> <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON>, an assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney for the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION>, contacted <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON>'s lawyer. `` -LRB- <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON> -RRB- notified my then-counsel that they had to give up the arrangements they had entered into with him for a series of meetings to discuss possible allegations against me,'' <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> said. Instead, <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> added, <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON> presented his lawyer with a draft of the indictment. `` -LRB- He -RRB- gave me three days in which to plead guilty and cooperate _ and then said if, in fact, I would give it some thought, perhaps they would n't indict me on a racketeering charge,'' <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> said. The station said <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON> replied, `` I can not comment on that'' when asked if <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> had been offered leniency in exchange for testimony against the attorney general. <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> said he was an unpaid adviser to <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION>, a Bronx-based, minority-owned defense contractor. He is under indictment on federal racketeering charges for allegedly taking payoffs from <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> officials to influence <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> and other public officials. Former <ORGANIZATION> Wedtech </ORGANIZATION> officials have testified they paid $ 800,000 to <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> to influence <PERSON> Meese </PERSON>. They have said <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> told them he got the attorney general to intercede on the company's behalf for a series of contracts worth $ 143 million. <PERSON> Meese </PERSON> has denied any wrongdoing. <PERSON> Wallach </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> KRON </ORGANIZATION> he expects to be acquitted of the racketeering charges and said the indictment `` appears to be very contrived and very contorted and extremely difficult to find a crime within it.''

<TEXT>
 The ancestral home of millions of people on <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> is here in <LOCATION> Fujian </LOCATION> province on the Chinese mainland, and local officials are trying to lure Taiwanese businessmen back. They have even enlisted the aid of a Chinese sea goddess. <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Fujian </LOCATION> are separated by 100 miles of water in the <LOCATION> Formosa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strait </LOCATION> and 40 years of hostility between the Communist mainland and Nationalist <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>. Some businessmen have come to <LOCATION> Fujian </LOCATION>, nevertheless, even at the risk of prosecution at home. Deputy Gov. You <PERSON> Dexin </PERSON> told visiting foreign reporters that 50 <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> firms have defied their government's ban on trade contacts with the mainland to invest about $ 50 million in the province. The actual number may be much higher. Most Taiwanese avoid trouble at home by contracting under the names of <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> agents or relatives on the mainland. Taiwan-Fujian trade, which totalled $ 40 million last year, reached $ 20 million in the first four months of 1988, You said. Most goes through middlemen in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, although more than 10 percent is done out on the <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strait </LOCATION>. Overall, indirect trade between <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> and the entire Chinese mainland was an estimated $ 1.5 billion last year. <LOCATION> Fujian </LOCATION> officials said among the ideas for bringing in more <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> money are plans to turn three offshore islands into economic zones for <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> investors. One is <LOCATION> Meizhou </LOCATION>, home of the 10th century legendary figure <PERSON> Mazu </PERSON> who is worshipped on both sides of the strait as a protrectress for seafarers. For businessmen braving the still stormy waters of the strait, <LOCATION> Mazu </LOCATION> could provide welcome shelter. <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> has been estranged from the mainland since the Nationalists lost a civil war to the Communists in 1949 and fled to the island. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, which regards <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> as a renegade province, encourages direct trade and communications links as a first step toward reunification. In the past, <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> adamantly refused all contacts with the mainland, but it began in October to allow people to visit relatives in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. In the first six months after travel restrictions were lifted, 65,000 Taiwanese came to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, many to <LOCATION> Fujian </LOCATION>, where about 80 percent of <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s 19.6 million people have their roots. <LOCATION> Fujian </LOCATION> officials say it is inevitable that <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, with its currency appreciating against the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar and its wage costs rising, will move factories to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, where labor is much cheaper and where language and customs are the same. `` They can make money here,'' said Chen He, magistrate of a township in the provincial capital of <LOCATION> Fuzhou </LOCATION>, which is building a $ 2.4-million sports equipment factory with a Taiwanese businessman. `` This is their homeland and they love it.'' During a recent press tour of the province, people frequently talked of contacts with <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> enterprises. <PERSON> Hong </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziwei </PERSON>, a 29-year-old toy manufacturer in <LOCATION> Shishi </LOCATION>, said he would meet a <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> businessman in August to discuss a joint venture to export toys. The Taiwanese man, he said, had written a letter to a local relative asking for help in finding a mainland partner. In <LOCATION> Quanzhou </LOCATION>, Mayor <PERSON> Chen </PERSON> <PERSON> Rongchun </PERSON> said sweet potatoes, a favorite among millions of Taiwanese with roots in <LOCATION> Fujian </LOCATION>, could be a big seller on <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>. `` <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> compatriots will cherish an intimate kind of emotion for goods coming from this place,'' he said. Much of the Taiwanese investment goes to <LOCATION> Xiamen </LOCATION>, a southern <LOCATION> Fujian </LOCATION> port that is one of the nation's four designated special economic zones with greater authority to attract foreign investment. <LOCATION> Xiamen </LOCATION>'s authorities said 39 projects with anticipated Taiwanese investment worth $ 42 million have been approved in such fields as jewelry, shoes, bicycle parts and aluminum window frames. While emphasizing that <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> is part of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, mainland officials say Taiwanese are given the same preferential treatment as foreign investors, or better. In <LOCATION> Xiamen </LOCATION>, for example, Taiwanese-funded joint ventures receive a four-year tax holiday, rather than the three years given foreign enterprises. Two Taiwanese business executives in May were given five-year prison terms by a <LOCATION> Taipei </LOCATION> court for business dealings on the mainland. Because of that <LOCATION> Fujian </LOCATION> officials promise to keep secret the details of all Taiwanese transactions. `` The first question we take into consideration is their personal security,'' Deputy Gov. You said. `` We take measures to keep their names secret.''

<TEXT>
 The telephone company launched a new service for culture-lovers Monday _ Dial-a-Poem. For 70 cents a minute, <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telecom </ORGANIZATION>'s customers can hear five-minute recordings of leading poets reciting their verse. Callers dialing 0898-222255 could hear <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Heath-Stubbs </PERSON>, 70, saying: `` I'm very happy to be the first poet to be recorded in this dial-a-poem series,'' before reciting from four of his poems, ranging in subject matter from <PERSON> Noah </PERSON>'s Ark through cats in poetry to clocks and space. <PERSON> Heath-Stubbs </PERSON> is among six contemporary poets chosen for Dial-a-Poem. It's too soon to tell whether the innovation will confound the 19th-century historian <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Macaulay </PERSON>'s conviction that `` as civilization advances, poetry almost necessarily declines.'' But something clearly is astir. The <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> subway has beun displaying verses of <LOCATION> Shelley </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Burns </PERSON> and de la Mare on some of its trains, and a year ago the railroad company organized poetry readings at some of its stations. <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> <PERSON> Chesney </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> English </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Language </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, the literary group that selected the poets for Dial-a-Poem, explained in a telephone interview: `` We felt we should make poetry more accessible.'' Added <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Bourne </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telecom </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman: `` Poetry was slowly fading away, and we thought it would be a great idea to bring it back.'' State-owned until it was floated on the stock market in 1984, <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telecom </ORGANIZATION> is ever on the lookout for a profit-making sideline, and it said that if <PERSON> Dial-a-Poem </PERSON> attracted 1,000 calls a week, it would make the service permanent. Others poets reading their verse for telephone callers during the six-week trial run are <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> McPhilemy </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jeremy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Kops </PERSON>, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Berry </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gillian </PERSON> <PERSON> Allnutt </PERSON>. `` We wanted something refreshingly adventurous _ poetry that is not so obscure that it does n't come across well on the phone, but that is also not strictly traditional,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Chesney </PERSON>. She said each poet would receive 10 percent of the profits from the service. One problem is <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telecom </ORGANIZATION>'s phone lines, which are n't famous for their clarity <PERSON> Heath-Stubbs </PERSON> came through somewhat faintly and would only be comprehensible in a quiet room. `` I do n't think the telephone does the poets justice in a way that hearing them firsthand would,'' Ms. <PERSON> Chesney </PERSON> said. `` But many people wo n't have the chance to hear them firsthand, and for them it's refreshing to hear them -LRB- the poets -RRB- in their own voices.'' To listen to Heath-Stubbs' entire five minutes costs $ 3.45 between 8 a.m. and 6 p.m. But a cheaper rate during slack hours brings the cost down to $ 2.25. A sampling from <PERSON> Heath-Stubbs </PERSON>'s `` The Cosmic Clock'': Planets, stars, galaxies _ the whole Winking and blinking caboodle _ This, it seems, is the only reliable clock: A beam from a star crossed a sensitive plate _ Then came the pips: the British nation Turned on the 10 o'clock news. This is the moving image of eternity _ I do n't mean <PERSON> Paley </PERSON>'s watch discarded By the absconding Watchmaker Upon a bank of Wordsworthian daffodils, But pulsars, quasars, decaying elements, black holes; Yet this, they say, is likewise winding down _ And hickory _ dickory, men and mice we run in it!

 The nation's largest Presbyterian body Monday called on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to end its 20-year occupation of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, where the church said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> had used `` repressive'' measures to quell Palestinian violence. The 200th <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Presbyterian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> declined to include in its resolution language calling on Palestinians to recognize <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right to exist as a nation. The Rev. <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Weir </PERSON>, a Presbyterian leader and former hostage in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, told the 630 commissioners the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> has made such statements several times. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> maintains that such <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> statements have been ambiguous or unauthoritative. The statement adopted Monday on a 494-67 vote said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> had responded to uprisings in the occupied territories with `` rigid censorship, mass arrests, torture of prisoners, administrative detention and deportation.'' The resolutions adopted also call upon the `` Palestinian people and leadership to exert sustained efforts to control acts of violence in order to facilitate the peace process.'' Earlier Monday, a major Presbyterian statement on nuclear war was revised to make the document more closely follow the original intention, according to the two former seminary professors who led the writing effort. The Committee on Peacemaking and International Relations of the <ORGANIZATION> Presbyterian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> -LRB- </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> U.S.A. </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- continued review Monday evening of `` Christian Obedience in a Nuclear Age,'' making minor changes in the recommendations of a subcommittee that extensively reviewed the paper. The major change by the Peacemaking committee was made at the suggestion of the Rev. <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Come </PERSON>, former president of the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Theological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seminary </ORGANIZATION> and a co-chairman of the task force that wrote the paper last year. Originally, the paper said nuclear war and the theory of nuclear deterrence were both immoral, but the subcommittee revised that to say `` nuclear deterrence has been in danger of becoming an end in itself rather than an interim measure of self-defense. Such a policy as an end in itself is not morally defensible.'' Come and the Rev. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Winn </PERSON>, the task force's co-chairman and former president of the <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, Theological Seminary, complained the phrase `` as an end in itself'' was ambiguous. At Come's suggestion, the language was clarified to say nuclear deterrence `` is being regarded as an adequate and permanent means to national security,'' and that is `` not morally defensible.'' The committee has yet to deal with the major question of the subcommittee's recommendation that the Christian obedience paper be adopted as church policy. The subcommittee, which met for parts of four days, amended the paper to make it clear Presbyterians considered obedience to government the normal course. <PERSON> Winn </PERSON> said he disliked many changes, but added, `` in many respects, they clarified the paper and deleted some statements that were not carefully worded.'' Supporters of the original paper expect many of the revisions _ including elimination of a recommendation that the church aid tax resisters _ would be restored in some form in the full committee. Opponents of the paper want it to be sent back to the churches for further study. An effort to get the subcommittee to recommend that delay was defeated 9-5 and the subcommittee eventually agreed to recommend the revised report as a church policy by a 15-1 vote. The report is not expected to come before the 630 delegates until Tuesday. The nine-day meeting adjourns at noon Wednesday. The resolution on the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> also: _ Asks <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to `` cease the systematic violation of human rights of Palestinians ... end the policies and-or practices of beatings and of food and fuel embargoes in the attempt to subjugate and break the will of the Palestinian population. ... end the settlements policy and the acquisition of land within the occupied territories, since -LRB- they -RRB- provoke the Arab peoples and reduce the opportunity for a peaceful resolution.'' _ Asks the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to `` discourage retaliation as a counter-terror strategy in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> and to address the injustices which are among the root causes of terrorism ... insist that weapons supplied by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s defense not be used against civilian populations in the occupied territories or in aggressive attacks or disproportionate retaliation upon other countries, and that further military and security assistance to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> be contingent upon the honoring of these principles. _ Ask all parties to participate in a United Nations-sponsored international peace conference The agenda included discussion of several decisions, including the recommendation that the pension board headquarters remain in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. A minority report suggests the board be moved to <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. The headquarters of the 3 million-member denomination was moved to <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, last year. Anti-abortion groups also have objected to the pension board's paying for abortions The denomination has adopted a generally pro-choice position, condemning abortion as a method of birth control, but saying it remains a decision by a woman, her physician and her conscience. Anti-abortionists say the pension board should not pay for abortions. Another committee has recommended the denomination undertake a new study on the issue of abortion.

 Big-city school districts and Southern states are requiring students to take an ever-mounting number of standardized tests in the name of reform, according to a nationwide survey. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> students are now taking at least 100 million standardized tests a year, says a report published Monday by <LOCATION> FairTest </LOCATION>, a non-profit <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION>, Mass.-based advocacy group that has attacked standardized tests as biased against women and minorities. The first-of-its-kind survey found: _ Elementary and secondary school students took 17.5 million standardized achievement, competency and basic skills tests to fulfill state mandates in the 42 states requiring them, and in the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> in 1986-87. _ Students took 38.9 million additional standardized tests to fulfill local school district testing mandates, according to the group. _ Between 30 million and 40 million standardized tests, including I.Q. tests, were administered to compensatory and special education students, and schools administered between 1.5 million and 1.75 million screening tests for kindergarten and prekindergarten students. _ College and secondary school admissions tests including the Scholastic Aptitude Test, ACT, high school achievement tests, and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assessment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Educational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Progress </ORGANIZATION> tests, accounted for 6 million to 7 million more. `` In this country now, pupils are being tested far too often with far too simplistic a measure. School reform has led many schools to become too test happy. The fallout hits those least able to defend themselves,'' said <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Monty </PERSON> <PERSON> Neill </PERSON>, managing director of <LOCATION> FairTest </LOCATION> and co-author of the survey. The report, `` Fallout from the Testing Explosion: How 100 Million Standardized Exams Undermine Equity and Excellence in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s Public Schools,'' included statistics compiled n a telephone survey last spring of education departments in all 50 states. It also surveyed 56 school districts, including those with enrollments of at least 100,000 pupils. It found that in the 1986-87 school year, the number of states using tests as part of statewide assessment programs rose from 37 to 42. Twenty-four states required students to pass a standardized test to graduate from high school rose in 1987, compared with 15 in 1985. Large school districts required the most standardized testing by far. Students in <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, averaged nine district-mandated standardized exams in 1986-87, according to <LOCATION> FairTest </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> students took an average of 2.92, <LOCATION> Broward </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, 2.60, <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> 2.45, <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> 2.34, <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> 2.30, and <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> 2.0. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, the nation's largest school district, required its students to take an average 1.23 standardized tests. The District of <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> mandated an average 1.39 per pupil. Southern states had the most state-mandated tests. The nation's 39.8 million public school students took 17,545,159 such state-mandated tests in 1986-87, an average 0.44 per student But Southern states often had testing rates more than double that national average. <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> required its 975,135 public school students to take 1,069,000 tests during the 1986-87 school year, meaning 1.10 such state-mandated tests per pupil. <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> students took an average of 1.01 state-mandated exams, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> 1.0, <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> 0.98, <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> 0.93, <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> 0.90, and <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> 0.83. `` Historically the South has been viewed as having weak school systems. There is a belief that you can test your way to better schools, and the South jumped on it,'' said <PERSON> Neill </PERSON> in a telephone interview. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Ewing </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Educational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Testing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, which administers the SAT and a variety of other standardized exams, said he had n't seen the report and could not comment on it.

 Members of a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Judiciary subcommittee, examining alleged abuses in the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s investigation of a group opposed to the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> policy, said Monday they intend to draft more restrictive standards for probes of terrorists in this country. `` What we've tried to do in the past is rely on the Constitution for protecting individual rights,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>, D-Calif., chairman of the civil and constitutional rights subcommittee `` I am thinking seriously of sometime early next year taking another quick look at this issue and writing the beginnings of an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> charter.'' <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> and other members of the panel appeared to agree with recommendations from four witnesses that there should be one standard, instead of the current two sets of guidelines, for <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> probes of domestic terrorism and that this standard should be written into law instead of left to the attorney general to determine. One witness, <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> <PERSON> Halperin </PERSON>, director of the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> office of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, said he believes that `` all investigations of political organizations should be based on public, codified guidelines and should include frequent review to ensure that they stay within the prescribed bounds.'' <PERSON> Halperin </PERSON> added, `` The <ORGANIZATION> ACLU </ORGANIZATION> believes that one publicly enunciated standard should apply for all criminal intelligence investigations.'' Spurring Monday's hearings was the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s handling of an investigation into the <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> in Solidarity with the People of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>, or <ORGANIZATION> CISPES </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported in Tuesday's editions that government officials said an internal <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> report has recommended disciplinary action against some bureau personnel, possibly including field agents, involved in the <ORGANIZATION> CISPES </ORGANIZATION> investigation. The officials said the report is the most critical to date from senior bureau officials and was sent last month to <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sessions </PERSON> from the bureau's Inspection Division. But the officials told the newspaper Sessions has not made a decision on whether to punish anyone for action in the CISPES operation. <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Milt </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahlerich </PERSON> would not comment on the contents of the division's report but said `` This agency has no hesitancy in disciplining its own people ...'' According to <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> documents released in January and comments by <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> officials since then, that investigation began in September 1981 as a probe into alleged criminal violations of domestic security laws. Specifically, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> was looking into whether <ORGANIZATION> CISPES </ORGANIZATION> was supplying money and material to leftist rebels in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. That investigation was closed the following February. But in March 1983, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> began a new investigation of <ORGANIZATION> CISPES </ORGANIZATION> under a different set of guidelines, those governing international terrorism. Although much of those guidelines are classified, it is known that they give the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> far more sweeping authority to investigate <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens. <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Richard </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> aide, told the subcommittee that `` it may not have been fully realized how frequently the groups that would be the targets of such -LRB- international terrorism -RRB- investigations would be composed primarily of American citizens.'' <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> and other witnesses agreed that although the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> said it was looking into whether <ORGANIZATION> CISPES </ORGANIZATION> was a front group for a core of people who were aiding international terrorists, the bureau's investigation ended up focusing on public CISPES meetings and statements `` Widescale monitoring of public events served on apparent purpose toward achieving the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s stated objective,'' <PERSON> Halperin </PERSON> testified. `` A front organization ... is not going to reveal its hidden agenda in its public activities.'' <PERSON> Halperin </PERSON> argued and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Finn </PERSON>, an assistant professor of government at <ORGANIZATION> Wesleyan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, disagreed that the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> violated the First Amendment rights of <ORGANIZATION> CISPES </ORGANIZATION> members by using that tactic. However, all four witnesses agreed that the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> never would have been able to conduct its investigation that way had it been required by law to look for criminal violations. `` The domestic security guidelines require a criminal link,'' <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> said, adding that that is not so with the international terrorism guidelines. `` The domestic security ... guidelines have worked so well in balancing civil liberties, intelligence and law enforcement concerns that it may be time to spread the benefits of these guidelines more widely,'' he said. The witnesses also said that an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> statute should require that investigations of suspected terrorists in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> be reviewed frequently by top <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials. <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bass </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, also a former <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official, told the panel that he thought there was a need for frequent reviews because `` it it my experience these investigations often continue a year or more after they should have ended.''

<TEXT>
 Author <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> says he has much more to tell about <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s MI5 intelligence service but plans no sequel to `` Spycatcher,'' the memoirs the British government failed to suppress here. `` There are 10 major stories which I have not put in and probably others if I thought hard enough,'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Australian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Monday It was the first time <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> had spoken publicly since the High Court ruled against the British government on June 2, ending a three-year court battle to block Australian publication of his story. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said it was the stories he had not told that led the government to fight so hard to suppress the book. `` They have always been frightened of what I know and what I might say publicly and they still are,'' he said. `` Spycatcher'' describes <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s 20-year career in the MI5 counterespionage service. It alleges that the security service eavesdropped on foreign embassies, burgled offices, stole documents, plotted assassination attempts and discussed how to bring down <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> government in the 1970s. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said he had not decided what to do with the unpublished material but doubted he would write a sequel. `` I'm too tired at the moment, we'll have to recover from all this and I think that perhaps I have done my bit,'' he said. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Lois </PERSON>, commented, `` There will be a sequel to Spycatcher over my dead body.'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, who retired to <LOCATION> Tasmania </LOCATION> in 1976, said the court battles in <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> helped make `` Spycatcher'' a bestseller. `` I thought initially we might get a print run of about 50,000 at most. Now we are looking at more than 1 million copies sold in the <LOCATION> U.S.A. </LOCATION> alone,'' he said. So far, more than 1.4 million copies have been sold in 40 countries, including the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, despite the government's continued ban in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> The book is frequently smuggled into <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and excerpts have been published in British newspapers. The British government has sought to clamp down on these as well, prompting outcries over freedom of the press. The government maintains it has pursued the case to uphold the principle that former security officers are bound by a lifetime oath of silence about their work. The Australian High Court said <LOCATION> Australian </LOCATION> courts had no jurisdiction to enforce a British security regulation.

 A fired computer company employee returned to his offices Monday and fatally shot himself after earlier holding two hostages at gunpoint for much of the day, authorities said. Police spokesman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wheatley </PERSON> said <PERSON> Mervin </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilliam </PERSON>, 28, entered Zeus Components in this <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> suburb with a 12-gauge shotgun shortly after 8 a.m. looking for his former boss and attempted to take four hostages, but two escaped. One man and one woman were held for much of the day. <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> Dippel </PERSON>, a company secretary in her 20s, was released early afternoon and <PERSON> Roman </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzales </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> resident in his early 30s, was released at about 4 p.m., <PERSON> Wheatley </PERSON> said.

The gunman's brother, <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilliam </PERSON>, and his mother arrived at the offices late Monday morning to help police negotiate, <PERSON> Wheatley </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Dwain </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, who described <PERSON> Gilliam </PERSON> as a friend and `` a very talented young man,'' said <PERSON> Gilliam </PERSON> had recently been through a period of depression after losing his girlfriend and his job. The company did not make public the reason for the firing. Police were on a direct telephone line with the man when they heard a muffled gunshot and the phone went dead about 5:20 p.m., said Capt. <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanna </PERSON>. Police entered the building immediately after hearing the shot and found <PERSON> Gilliam </PERSON> dead, <PERSON> Hanna </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 The country's foremost theater is gripped by a real-life drama that rivals the classics presented on its historic stage. The star is West German Claus Peymann, imported to direct the Burgtheater and embroiled in battles with his actors and the <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> cultural establishment. A premier of `` Oedipus'' Sunday night turned into a demonstration for and against <ORGANIZATION> Peymann </ORGANIZATION>, with banners unfurled on stage and the divided audience booing and cheering. A city that relishes scandal and prizes its theaters and opera, got the first whiffs of sensation on May 26, when the West German weekly <ORGANIZATION> Die </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zeit </ORGANIZATION> published an interview with <PERSON> Peymann </PERSON>. The director said `` this country is a madhouse'' and that he was often involved in `` dreadful things of the most banal kind.'' He even suggested that the famed Burgtheater be torn down. Reaction was swift. The Socialist politicians who appointed <ORGANIZATION> Peymann </ORGANIZATION> in 1986 predictably defended their choice, arguing that the director had brought life and exciting art to the marble halls of the <PERSON> Burg </PERSON>. Conservatives offended by <PERSON> Peymann </PERSON>'s stark productions of beloved German classics seized the chance to call for the director's resignation The Burgtheater actors were quick to criticize Peymann for cutting salaries and for changing the way tickets, rehearsals and roles are allocated. Nearly everybody attacked Peymann for bringing in 15 actors from <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Most of them are friends from <ORGANIZATION> Peymann </ORGANIZATION>'s days as director of the West German theater in <LOCATION> Bochem </LOCATION> before he was lured to <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>. The newcomers have gotten almost all the leading roles in Peymann's new productions. But locals ridiculed the new actors for their northern German vernacular, which offends the ear of an audience used to the distinctive delivery long considered among the Burgtheater's greatest merits. The issue became the chief topic of conversation in Viennese coffeehouses and the media entered the fray with debates on Peymann. Many commentators saw an attempt by Germans to subvert <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>'s distinctive German language and culture <PERSON> Franz </PERSON> <PERSON> Morak </PERSON>, anti-Peymann spokesman for the Burgtheater ensemble, spoke of a `` de-Austrianization'' of the <PERSON> Burg </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Peymann </ORGANIZATION> countered Monday with accusations of `` nationalism and hatred for strangers'' in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>. That charge has often been made in a city that prizes the imperial past that gave it the Burgtheater and many other artistic institutions. When <PERSON> Lorin </PERSON> <PERSON> Maazel </PERSON> stepped down as director of the city's famous opera in 1984, two years before his contract expired, he bitterly charged that critics and officials had united to get him out. Criticism of the directors of the <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Opera </LOCATION> and the Burgtheater has a long tradition in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, where the posts are often described as <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>'s most impossible jobs. But the drama over <ORGANIZATION> Peymann </ORGANIZATION> has reached an unusual pitch. With discussion in full swing, prominent commentator <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Rauscher </PERSON> in the tabloid Kurier was one of the few to chide his compatriots for their absorption in the Peymann affair. In a column, <PERSON> Rauscher </PERSON> described the effect of picking up Austrian newspapers on the plane while on his way home. `` One can only shake one's head in amusement and despair,'' wrote <PERSON> Rauscher </PERSON>. `` Are these really our worries? This orgy of small-mindedness? These childish quarrels? Is the plane landing in a republic of dwarfs? Or in a kindergarten?''

 As part of the campaign against the spread of AIDS, travelers are being given the opportunity to learn how to suggest the use of a condom in seven languages. `` Sex has become more dangerous. ... This does not mean that one should be afraid of sex, but observant and careful of oneself and others,'' says a pamphlet included in a package for sale at travel agencies and train stations around <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>. The package includes a packet of condoms and a dictionary of sex-related phrases, according to the Social Affairs ministry. Among the phrases are, `` I want us to use a condom,'' and `` I think I might have a venereal disease.'' `` Only the condom can provide any good protection against sexually transmitted diseases,'' the pamphlet says. Health authorities this year sent 4 million pamphlets to homes to explain in graphic detail how AIDS is transmitted and distributed camouflage condoms to military conscripts.

 A House Judiciary panel is considering writing tougher standards for <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> terrorism investigations in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to prevent the bureau from violating the rights of legitimate domestic political groups. Lawmakers concede that election-year politics probably will delay action until 1989. But during a hearing on Monday into alleged <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> abuses in an investigation of anti-Reagan administration activists, members of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on civil and constitutional rights agreed with witnesses who recommended new controls on such investigations. <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> officials have said an internal investigation of the operation found several problems with it, and <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported today that an internal <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> report recommends disciplinary action against some of those involved. <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Milt </PERSON> <PERSON> Ahlerich </PERSON> would not comment on the contents of the report and said that <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Sessions </PERSON> had made no decision on its recommendations. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> conducted much of its probe of the <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> in Solidarity with the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Salvador </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> group opposed to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration policies in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, under guidelines that are supposed to cover investigations of international terrorism. Using those guidelines allowed the bureau to conduct widespread surveillance of political rallies and individuals including nuns, union officials and college professors opposed to administration policy. Witnesses and lawmakers at Monday's hearing said there should be just one set of guidelines instead of the current two _ domestic and international _ governing such investigations. The standard, witnesses agreed, should specify that the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> look for criminal actions and steer clear of a group's political activity. Lawmakers and witnesses also agreed that the standard should be written into law instead of left to the attorney general to determine. `` What we've tried to do in the past is rely on the Constitution for protecting individual rights,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>, D-Calif., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panel `` I am thinking seriously of sometime early next year taking another quick look at this issue and writing the beginnings of an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> charter.'' The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> justified its use of the international terrorism probe guidelines in the <ORGANIZATION> CISPES </ORGANIZATION> investigation by citing an informant's claim that some of the group's members were giving money and supplies to a leftist group in <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> But no criminal charges were ever filed against <ORGANIZATION> CISPES </ORGANIZATION> or any of its members, and the investigation was closed in June 1985. One witness at Monday's hearing, <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> <PERSON> Halperin </PERSON>, director of the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> office of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, said the current guidelines `` accommodate the demands of law enforcement without fully protecting the lawful exercise of our constitutional rights.'' <PERSON> Halperin </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s investigation of <ORGANIZATION> CISPES </ORGANIZATION> `` demonstrates that the current <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> guidelines have failed to protect Americans from improper government surveillance.'' According to <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> documents released in January and comments by <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> officials since then, the bureau's initial probe of <ORGANIZATION> CISPES </ORGANIZATION> began in September 1981 as an investigation into alleged criminal violations of domestic security laws. That investigation was closed the following February.

Although much of those guidelines are classified, it is known that they give the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> far more sweeping authority to investigate <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens than the domestic guidelines do. <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Richard </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> aide, told the panel that when the international terrorism guidelines were written, `` it may not have been fully realized how frequently the groups that would be the targets of such investigations would be composed primarily of American citizens.'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Finn </PERSON>, an assistant professor of government at <ORGANIZATION> Wesleyan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, disagreed with <PERSON> Halperin </PERSON>'s contention that the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> violated the First Amendment rights of <ORGANIZATION> CISPES </ORGANIZATION> members by attending <ORGANIZATION> CISPES </ORGANIZATION> meetings, obtaining the group's literature and recording the license plate numbers of cars parked outside <ORGANIZATION> CISPES </ORGANIZATION> meetings. But all of the witnesses, including <PERSON> Finn </PERSON>, agreed that the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> would not have been able to mount such an extensive domestic surveillance campaign had it been limited to looking for actual criminal violations. `` Widescale monitoring of public events served no apparent purpose toward achieving the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s stated objective. A front organization ... is not going to reveal its hidden agenda in its public activities,'' <PERSON> Halperin </PERSON> said. `` The domestic security guidelines require a criminal link,'' <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> said, adding that those rules have worked well `` in balancing civil liberties, intelligence and law enforcement concerns.'' The witnesses also said that an <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> statute should require that investigations of suspected terrorists in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> be reviewed frequently by top <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials to ensure that there is sufficient evidence to continue.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> has reduced the government's protection against lawsuits by victims of defective federally licensed vaccines, but some authorities say the ruling's impact may be limited The justices ruled unanimously Monday that the parents of <PERSON> Kevan </PERSON> <PERSON> Berkovitz </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> boy crippled by polio, may sue the government. But <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Greene </PERSON>, a lawyer for <ORGANIZATION> Lederle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION> which manufactures polio vaccine, said the impact is unclear. The decision appears to cover all government-licensed vaccines and possibly other drugs as well, he said. But he added that the standards enunciated by the court may affect few cases. `` The facts alleged here are unusual and I do n't know whether they -LRB- the <PERSON> Berkovitz </PERSON> family -RRB- can prove them,'' he said. `` These are circumstances that are unlikely to arise'' very often. Health experts, meanwhile, said the nation's common vaccines pose little risk. `` In terms of serious side effects, it's far better to be vaccinated than to get the disease,'' said <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Giebink </PERSON>, professor of pediatrics at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. Polio paralysis results only from about one out of every 3.2 million doses of oral polio vaccine, he said. In another example, about one in 110,000 children who get the Diphtheria-Tetanus-Pertussis -LRB- DTP -RRB- vaccine develop a brain dysfunction that can include seizures. It is usually temporary. Only about one in 310,000 vaccinated children suffer permanent damage that includes mental retardation or movement difficulties, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration lawyers had warned that exposing the government to financial liability for faulty vaccines could have serious consequences. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the threat of big-money damages against the government could threaten availability of lifesaving vaccines by prompting federal officials to reconsider the approval of polio vaccine, and delay or withhold approval for new vaccines. <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, which licenses more than 40 vaccines, declined to comment on the ruling. A financial analyst said the decision may be good news for drug manufacturers. `` This is very good for the vaccine companies, but there are not that many of them,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Vieter </PERSON>, a drug industry analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` One might look ahead to vaccines such as AIDS vaccines and other bio-tech applications, though. `` It seems the government will have to exert quite a bit more care in the approval process to prevent placing the government in a liability situation,'' <PERSON> Vieter </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Kevan </PERSON> <PERSON> Berkovitz </PERSON> was two months old in May 1979 when his pediatrician in <LOCATION> Charleroi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, gave him a dose of <LOCATION> Orimune </LOCATION>, a polio vaccine made by <ORGANIZATION> Lederle </ORGANIZATION>. Orimune, a form of <PERSON> Sabin </PERSON> oral vaccine, was licensed by the government in 1963. <PERSON> Kevan </PERSON> was stricken with polio within a month after taking the vaccine and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Communicable Disease Center determined he contracted the disease from the vaccine. The boy, now 9, is paralyzed from the neck down and uses a respirator to help him breathe. Monday's ruling provides an opportunity in court to seek compensation for him from the government. His lawyer, <PERSON> Ellen </PERSON> <PERSON> Viakely </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>, said of the ruling, `` It's a case where the government knew that this particular polio vaccine violated its own regulatory safety standards. By the government's own regulatory standards, this vaccine was unsafe. But it licensed it anyway.'' Ms. <PERSON> Viakely </PERSON> said the ruling will not affect cases in which those who received a vaccine had an allergic reaction. The polio vaccine is the only common vaccine clearly shown to cause the disease it was supposed to prevent, said <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Katz </PERSON>, chairman of the pediatrics department at the <ORGANIZATION> Duke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Sabin </PERSON> vaccine is now administered routinely to nearly every child in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and has all but eliminated polio. But each year a small number of people suffer adverse reactions to the vaccine, federal officials say. In other actions, the court: _ Agreed to judge the constitutionality of a new sentencing system for people convicted of federal crimes By the time the justices announce their decision sometime in 1989, more than 10,000 federal court defendants will have been subjected to the new sentencing system. _ Armed police with new authority as it ruled unanimously in a <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION> case that officers sometimes may pursue someone who starts running at the sight of them, even though they have no reason to suspect criminal conduct _ Barred states from banning all direct-mail advertisements sent by lawyers to potential clients Voting 6-3, the justices struck down <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>'s policy of prohibiting lawyers from sending letters to people they know face legal problems.

 New findings showing that AIDS can be transmitted through breast milk should not deter Third World mothers from breast-feeding their babies, experts say. Six cases of the lethal AIDS virus, called HIV, being spread through breast milk were reported Monday at the <ORGANIZATION> Fourth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> on AIDS. But the hazards of bottle-feeding in poor countries are probably higher, some of the scientists said. `` The benefits of being breast-fed by an HIV-infected mother clearly outweigh the risks in developing countries,'' said <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Family </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> in Research Triangle Park, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>. She and her colleagues conducted a statistical analysis showing that babies in poor countries are far more likely to die from diseases resulting from bottle-feeding than from the possible risk of catching the AIDS virus In poor parts of the world, bottle-feeding is often risky, in large part because infant formula can be mixed with contaminated water. Researchers from <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> studied 45 AIDS-infected children in <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>, where AIDS infections are relatively common. They said they found no evidence that any of them caught the virus from breast milk. `` We feel that transmission from breast milk is quite low,'' said Dr. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Ho </PERSON>, one of the <ORGANIZATION> Cornell </ORGANIZATION> researchers. `` On a broad basis, it is probably not an important factor.'' Experts believe that most babies with AIDS got the infection from their mothers before birth. There is a 25 percent to 50 percent risk that an infected mother will pass the virus to her developing child. The risk of contracting the disease through breast-feeding is probably substantially greater from mothers infected after birth as opposed to those carrying the virus before conception, said Dr. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Ziegler </PERSON> of Prince of <LOCATION> Wales </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Children </LOCATION><LOCATION> 's </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Westmead </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>. `` Breast-feeding women should be aware that if they become infected, their baby is likely to be infected as well,'' he said. <PERSON> Ziegler </PERSON> has reviewed nine cases in which breast-feeding women became infected with the AIDS virus after giving birth and found that three of their babies caught the virus. He described two of the cases, while a third in <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> was reported by Dr. <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> <PERSON> Bucens </PERSON> of Princess <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Hospital </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Perth </LOCATION>. `` We do n't know how often this happens,'' <PERSON> Bucens </PERSON> said. `` In the Third World countries, this is of great importance because of the enormity of heterosexual transmission'' of the AIDS virus. `` There are so many women who are infected.'' <PERSON> Ziegler </PERSON> said that for uninfected babies whose mothers had the virus before they were born, the risk of breast-feeding is probably relatively small. But it appears to be substantially higher if the woman catches the virus while she is breast-feeding. This is because she is likely to produce high levels of virus in her breast milk early in the infection. One typical case was presented by Dr. <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinbreck </PERSON> and colleagues from the <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Limoges </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>. A 28-year-old woman received a transfusion of AIDS-tainted blood after giving birth. She then breast-fed her baby for a month. Two years later, she developed AIDS, and her child was also found to be infected. Two other cases were reported by Dr. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Colebunders </PERSON> from <LOCATION> Mama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Yemo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Kinshasa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION>. In one of them, a baby caught the virus from an AIDS-infected wet nurse. Acquired immune deficiency syndrome attacks the body's immune system, leaving victims susceptible to a wide variety of infections and cancers. It is is most often transmitted through sexual contact. Other means of transmission include transfusions of tainted blood or blood products, and the sharing of contaminated hypodermic needles or syringes by drug abusers.

 Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> and <PERSON> Prince </PERSON> <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> have joined in a campaign to win for <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> one of the greatest private art collections in the world, according to news reports. The 1,600 paintings of Swiss <PERSON> Baron </PERSON> <PERSON> Heinrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Thyssen-Bornemisza </PERSON> are regarded as the finest art collection in private hands after that of Queen <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>. They are conservatively valued at $ 1.41 billion. There has been a fierce international competition for the collection, with <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> regarded as the favorite. The baron, grandson of the Ruhr steel magnate who armed the German forces in World War I, has made a commitment to <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> to show most of his paintings in <LOCATION> Madrid </LOCATION> for at least 10 years. But government sources in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> said Monday that Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> has written the baron. A spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Thyssen-Bornemisza </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> said Monday that a long-term proposal `` may have been received from the British government,'' but no decision had been made. Its commitment to <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> remained unaffected by any proposals from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, the spokesman said. Prince <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> reportedly broke away from a vacation in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> to visit <ORGANIZATION> Thyssen </ORGANIZATION> at his <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lugano </LOCATION> home May 4 to discuss the long-term future of the collection. On May 21, Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> sent <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> Secretary Sir <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> to <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> for further talks at the baron's home. The prime minister followed up her offer of a purpose-built gallery for the collection in a two-page, handwritten letter, the domestic news agency <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Grey </PERSON>, president of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> and Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> had done everything possible to see that <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> did not miss a great opportunity. `` The intervention of Prince <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> is the sort of thing that would count in the baron's mind,'' said <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Grey </PERSON>. The Times said the 67-year-old baron has been concerned about the disposition of the collection, begun by his father but broken up at the order of the <LOCATION> Swiss </LOCATION> courts at his father's death. <ORGANIZATION> Thyssen </ORGANIZATION> was adamant that the collection should remain basically intact, the <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> said, in a country prepared to give it a respectful home. <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Getty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> are also competing for the chance to house the collection.

<TEXT>
 Americans wanting to sell anything from biscuits and cigars to plumbing and whiskey often have tried to cloak their wares in the presumed respectability of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and its most illustrious members. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Webster </PERSON>, for example. <PERSON> Webster </PERSON>, perhaps the most famous senator and orator of the mid-19th century, had his face and his name used to promote cigars, flour, and a concoction known as Dr. <ORGANIZATION> J.C. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ayres </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cherry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pectoral </ORGANIZATION>, promoted as a cure for coughs, colds, bronchitis, croup, whooping cough and other ailments. According to a new three-case exhibit recently installed in a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> corridor, the claim that <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> endorsed Dr. <PERSON> Ayres </PERSON>' elixer may have been somewhat exaggerated. Promoters of the product claimed that <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> praised it in 1853. The famed statesman died in 1852. The exhibit, organized by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on Art and Antiquities, includes a shiny metal spatula from 1910 which demonstrates that even 58 years after <PERSON> Webster </PERSON>'s death his name still had commercial appeal. <PERSON> Webster </PERSON>'s features are engraved on the widest spot of the antique pancake turner, which is also emblazoned with the words: `` <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> Flour, Better Than the Best'' and `` One Good Turn Deserves Another.'' <PERSON> Webster </PERSON>'s face was also used on the flour bag with the words: `` <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> Flour Bakes Everything Better.'' In an age when a cigar brought to mind a politician, <PERSON> Webster </PERSON> also was used to promote a brand of cigars. Their name? `` Websters,'' of course. The names and faces of <PERSON> Webster </PERSON>'s contemporaries, Sens. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Calhoun </PERSON> of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Clay </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> also were used to peddle cigars. And for years, <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Crow </LOCATION> whiskey identified itself as, `` The Whiskey That <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Clay </PERSON> Took to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>.'' `` From the earliest days of advertising, senators have been known to endorse commercial products,'' notes a news release issued by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> commission. From the beginning of the advertising age in the mid-19th century, `` our country's enterprises have understood the power of national legislative symbols to influence the American consumer,'' the commission said. The display has a title _ `` What This Country Needs'' _ taken from the 1917 declaration of Vice President <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> that `` What this country needs is a good five cent cigar.'' Although <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> did not recommend any particular brand of nickel cigar, the exhibit makes clear that he would not have been breaking new ground had he done so. A much later advertisement for Lucky Strike cigarettes reads: `` <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nye </PERSON> Says: ` I enjoy the comfort a light smoke gives my throat.'' The familiar image of the Capitol dome has been used, according to the exhibit, to symbolize `` purity, wholesomeness, respectability and success, innovation and leadership, prosperity and celebration.'' In one 1890's advertisement, the Capitol looms in the background as two bearded senators are served Schlitz beer at a table surrounded by ferns. `` The Capitol at <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> is painted with oxide of zinc,'' proclaims another advertisement, implying that <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> homeowners would do well to use that ingredient on their own domicile. On display are advertisements for breakfast cereals, stationery, soft drinks, biscuits, tires, soap, cameras, and plumbing, all using the Capitol theme. One proclaims that the <ORGANIZATION> Durham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Plumbing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION> has been installed in `` the greatest building on this continent _ the Capitol at <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>.'' In another, fashionably dressed men, presumably senators, are shown striding up the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'s marble steps. All of this has caused an occasional raised eyebrows, and the Arts and <ORGANIZATION> Antiquities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> notes that the use of the Capitol in commercial advertising never has been sanctioned by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. But neither has the practice been banned. In 1956 the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> reported out a bill banning the use of `` pictures of the Capitol or other public buildings in ... advertising when it would be reasonably calculated to convey the false impression that the company has some connection with, or was insured by, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> Government.'' The measure passed the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. But the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> failed to act on it.

 -LRB- End embargoed material -RRB- <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> met on Monday with members of the <ORGANIZATION> Cuban-American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, an anti-Castro group. `` There have been no accommodations made with <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>'s corrupt communist government by this administration and, if I may inject a partisan point, I guarantee you there will be no accommodations'' during a <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> presidency, he said. The private organization has agreed to help resettle some 4,000 Latin Americans in this country. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> engaged in a form of one-upmanship with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> after the vice president went beyond the usually tame administration stance and labeled <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> a `` racist state.'' When informed of that comment, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> called for an international boycott of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, saying it `` not only is engaging in blatant racism and terrorism, it is engaging in naked aggression against its neighbors.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> headed from <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> today to address the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mayors </ORGANIZATION> after meeting on Monday with the editorial boards of the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Johnson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publishing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which prints Ebony and Jet magazines. Even if <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> picks someone else, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> told reporters in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor could look for backing from him `` so long as our agreements are rational, fair and consistent.'' But <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> noted that major differences remain, including <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' refusal to join him in supporting a military spending freeze and tax hikes aimed at upper-income Americans. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said he planned to deliver several major policy speeches before the convention outlining his programs for health care, education, the war on drugs, and foreign and defense policy. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was leaving behind budget troubles in the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Statehouse </LOCATION>. The governor met for an hour Monday with aides and legislative leaders in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> about the projected $ 400 million deficit his administration faces. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>'s presidential campaign has taken a hard line against federal tax increases. One participant in the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> meeting indicated that the possibility of new state taxes was discussed, but no decisions were made. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> received some encouraging news from the latest <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> poll, which showed him gaining slightly on <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, who held a seven-point lead in the same poll in May and a double-digit advantage in other surveys, received 49 percent support in the latest poll to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s 44 percent. Seven percent remained uncommitted. The <ORGANIZATION> Lou </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> telephone survey of 1,258 likely voters was conducted June 1-6. The results each had a margin of error of plus or minus three percentage points, meaning the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> lead was within the margin.

 An <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> greenhouse has become the site of a million-dollar battle to find some way to stamp out the coca plants grown illicitly in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and processed into cocaine, <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> officials confirm. The greenhouse near <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> is one of two <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> research sites where 400 to 600 coca plants are being produced under the project, Dr. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Knipling </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said Monday. The other is an outdoor site at an undisclosed location in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> where the largely tropical plants will not be hit with frost, he said. He said the plants used in the experiment are incinerated afterward and that cocaine is never produced from them. The objective is to test herbicides to determine which ones are effective in killing the hardy coca plants. Researchers earlier had grown opium poppies in <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION> and marijuana in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as part of <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s research into ways to stem narcotics. But the priority changed two years ago because of growing use by Americans of both cocaine and crack, a cocaine derivative, <PERSON> Knipling </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s coca production was disclosed Sunday in <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Knipling </PERSON> estimated the cost of the program at `` about $ 1 million a year.'' He said some funds come from the research service's regular budget and the rest from the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> Guards, alarms and wire fences are being used to keep out intruders at the installations, <PERSON> Knipling </PERSON> said. He refused to disclose the precise whereabouts of either of the growing sites. Coca seeds were brought to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Knipling </PERSON> said. He said a number of herbicides have been tested for use against coca. The chief herbicide recommended to the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is tebutherion, a product manufactured by <ORGANIZATION> Eli </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lilly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION> under the trade name <PERSON> Spike </PERSON>. <PERSON> Knipling </PERSON> said it is used in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to clear brush in areas where food crops do not grow. The subject of <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s testing surfaced when the former head of the project, <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Gentner </PERSON>, told reporters he had resigned in April to protest what he called the failure of the Agriculture and State departments to examine thoroughly enough the potential dangers from use of the herbicide. <PERSON> Knipling </PERSON> said <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> cocaine production is doing far more to endanger the environment than would use of tebutherion. He said there was little doubt that the coca leaves were being heavily sprayed with pesticides, which could cause harm. Moreover, he said, sulfuric acid and other chemicals being used to process the coca into cocaine undoubtedly are dumped into streams when the manufacturing process is over. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunlop </PERSON>, assistant secretary of agriculture for natural resources and the environment, said coca producers, `` in their efforts to satiate the habits of American cocaine addicts, are doing heavy and extreme environmental damage.'' `` They are slashing and burning the tropical rain forest'' to clear more ground for coca planting, he said.

 <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Rudy </PERSON> <PERSON> Perpich </PERSON> emerged from a visit with <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> and reported no progress in getting the government to suspend conservation restrictions to combat drought problems. `` I hope there'll be rain in the next two weeks,'' <PERSON> Perpich </PERSON> said Monday after the session in <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON>'s office. He said <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> was encouraging about an emergency feed program to help livestock producers whose hay and grazing land have been scorched by drought but refused to lift curbs imposed under the Conservation Reserve Program. That program, established in 1985, aims to take 45 million acres out of crop production by 1990 and cover them instead with trees and grasses. Farmers sign contracts to include such highly erodible lands in the reserve and in exchange obtain government payments. <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> officials recently estimated the overall cost of the reserve program to the taxpayers at $ 677 million for 1987, $ 1.864 billion for this year and $ 2.16 billion next year. <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> has the power in an emergency to suspend program rules that bar cutting hay and grazing livestock on such lands. <PERSON> Perpich </PERSON> said, however, that <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON> was reluctant to do so, saying the lands involved are fragile and should remain in conservation use. Under an emergency feed program, the federal government would pay substantial costs for acquiring feed for livestock and bringing it into the state. But local officials would have to apply for it. <PERSON> Lyng </PERSON>'s office said he would have no comment on the session with the Minnesotans. Earlier, <PERSON> Perpich </PERSON> met with Sen. <PERSON> Quentin </PERSON> <PERSON> Burdick </PERSON>, D-N. The governor said he would discuss the situation later with <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON>, D-Vt. <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> Agriculture Commissioner <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON> said the drought could wipe out as much as half of the state's crops and that the cost to the hardest hit counties in that case would total $ 400 million `` There just is no hay in <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>,'' he said. He said that opening the Conservation Reserve Program acreage would cost the taxpayers nothing while putting an emergency feed program in effect would carry a price tag.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> has added a new dimension to the complex conflict in southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> by constructing a military air base in southern <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> just a few minutes flying time from <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> African-controlled </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, according to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials. The construction of the base in support of increased <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> troop strength in southern <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> appears to have heightened the possibility of an eventual clash between <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> and South African forces, the officials said. In addition to <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> also has forces in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> supporting a U.S.-backed anti-communist rebel group. The presence of the Cuban troops within 10 miles of the Namibian border prompted <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> to call up army reserves last week. The South Africans say the Cuban forces, interspersed with Namibian guerrillas fighting for independence, are spread across a 280-mile front. According to the officials, who asked not to be identified, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> appears to be jockeying for position as talks aimed at reaching a negotiated settlement intensify. President <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> informed a gathering of Third World foreign ministers meeting in <LOCATION> Havana </LOCATION> two weeks ago of the construction of the air base. `` We now have air superiority and anti-air superiority,'' Cuban news accounts of <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>'s comments said. `` We have the means to confront any South African adventure,'' he said. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said the air strip under construction appears capable of handling MiG-23 jet fighters. In early May, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> joined the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and a joint Angolan-Cuban delegation in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> for unprecedented peace talks. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> objective is achieving an agreement that will lead to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s withdrawal from both <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> and the withdrawal of the estimated 43,000 to 45,000 Cuban troops from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Castro </PERSON> said <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s willingness to negotiate was the result of the Cuban troop deployment near the Namibian border. Also part of the equation is the American-backed rebel movement in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> which has been fighting that country's Marxist government for 13 years. But the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> considers that issue to be an internal Angolan problem which should not be part of the negotiating effort. All sides said the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> talks were constructive and they agreed to meet again. There has been no agreement as yet on a site. The parties to the conflict are far apart on a timetable for reaching a settlement. <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> have set out a four-year timetable for the withdrawal of the Cuban troops while insisting on a one-year process leading to black majority rule and independence for <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> as well as the withdrawal of South African occupation forces from the territory. The independence process for <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> is spelled out in a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> resolution. Meanwhile, Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> pledged on Monday that, if elected, he will make `` no accommodations'' with <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION>. He made the statement at a ceremony formalizing an agreement with the <ORGANIZATION> Cuban-American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> that will permit the immigration to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> of about 1,500 Cubans living in third countries. The Foundation, an anti-Castro group, has agreed to pay the costs of resettling the Cubans in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.

 After 16 years and more than 4 billion miles, Pioneer 10 is still speeding toward interstellar space and perhaps for the next decade should continue to provide clues to some of the puzzles of the universe, scientists said. The little spacecraft, which left the solar system five years ago, has literally and figuratively gone far beyond its original mission to study Jupiter and the asteroid belt, scientists said. The 570-pound Pioneer 10 is relaying strong evidence to suggest a mysterious Planet X or possibly two smaller planets exist beyond <LOCATION> Pluto </LOCATION>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Adminstration </ORGANIZATION>'s Jet Propulsion Laboratory said Monday. `` We have a 90 to 99 percent confidence that Uranus and <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION> are being disturbed, and one candidate for that is a single Planet X,'' he said. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> and other scientists reported on Pioneer 10 to observe the fifth anniversary of the craft's leaving the known solar system. The probe was launched in 1972 and traveled an arc-shaped, 620 million mile path from <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> before making its closest approach to <LOCATION> Jupiter </LOCATION> _ 82,000 miles _ on Dec. 3, 1973. Pioneer 10 was the first spacecraft to cross the Asteroid Belt, between <LOCATION> Mars </LOCATION> and Jupiter, and fly by <PERSON> Jupiter </PERSON> and return pictures. It also was the first to chart the giant planet's intense radiation belts and measure the mass of its four planet-size moons. Data from Pioneer 10 showed that Jupiter is predominantly liquid. Its twin, Pioneer 11, was launched in 1973, encountered <ORGANIZATION> Jupiter </ORGANIZATION> a year later and reached Saturn in September 1979. Scientists said Pioneer 10 is expected to operate another seven to 10 years and may run out of energy before it reaches interstellar space. Until then, the spacecraft will keep looking for long gravity waves proposed by <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Einstein </PERSON>, and may give scientists clues to the shape of the heliosphere, the boundary of the sun's influence. `` One of the principal current objectives is the observation of cosmic rays and the flow of the solar wind at heretofore unexplored distances from the sun,'' said physicist <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Iowa </ORGANIZATION>, a principal investigator on the project. `` We now have a realistic expectation of finding the outer boundary of the heliosphere ... and of penetrating into the nearby interstellar media,'' said <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON>, who discovered radiation belts surrounding <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. Pioneer 10 is now sending back radio signals from a distance 45 times the distance between the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> and sun. The energy picked up by a 230-foot deep space antenna would have to be stored for over 11 billion years to accumulate enough energy to light a 7 -LCB- - watt nightlight for one millisecond, said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fimmel </PERSON>, project manager at the <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ames </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> But the signals from Pioneer 10 and 11 are strong enough to send high quality data on a daily basis, <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> said.

 Consumer groups are criticizing a compromise bill fashioned by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, saying the measure will make it harder for victims of unsafe products to recover damages from manufacturers. Both sides in the protracted struggle between business and consumer lobbyists agree, however, that there is virtually no chance the so-called product liability bill will pass <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in this election year. The measure will go next to the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, which shares jurisdiction over the issue but has balked at approving such legislation in the past. Even if it manages to reach the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> _ which many congressional observers doubt _ the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> is considered a graveyard for product liability bills. The measure, eagerly sought by corporations worried about escalating liability costs, would impose a uniform federal standard of liability pre-empting a wide variety of conflicting state laws. Consumer activists complain that the new proposed federal standard would limit victims of hazardous products to six narrow grounds for suing manufacturers for damages: negligence, intentional wrongdoing, defect design, defective construction, inadequate warnings and breach of written warranty. Another major feature contested by consumer advocates is the `` state of the art'' defense available to manufacturers. This provision says that a manufacturer can escape liability for damages if it can prove it did not know _ or could not know _ of a design defect with knowledge `` reasonably available to experts,'' or if there were no feasible alternative design. A pro-consumer `` escape hatch'' sponsored by Rep. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Synar </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Okla </LOCATION>., would require only that the plaintiff prove that the product was so unsafe compared with its usefulness that it should not have been marketed The committee also accepted <PERSON> Synar </PERSON>'s proposal easing the standard of proof that plaintiffs must meet The <PERSON> Synar </PERSON> provision also would put a burden of proof on the manufacturer to show that a design defect could not be discovered and that an alternative design was not feasible. Consumer lobbyists are unhappy, though, with <PERSON> Synar </PERSON>'s proposal to give a judge not a trial jury _ the responsibility for deciding whether a product was so unsafe it should never have been marketed. Even with <PERSON> Synar </PERSON>'s softening of the pro-business features of the original bill, consumer groups say the measure undermines the legal doctrine of `` strict liability'' used by 47 states and favored by victim advocates. That doctrine shifts the focus of a liability trial from the manufacturer's alleged misconduct to the defective product itself, relieving the courts of establishing what a manufacturer knew or should have known about its product. Consumer lobbyists argue that even though the bill makes strict liability a national standard in deciding damage suits, it is weakened by including a state-of-the-art defense against manufacturers' liability, which currently is allowed in only eight states. Not covered by the bill are tobacco, alcohol and asbestos. Those products would continue to be subject to generally more stringent state liability laws. The bill also includes a provision backed by anti-abortionists that would deny special protection to any drug or contraceptive device that induces abortions.

<TEXT>
 Three years ago today, two young men who could have passed for well-dressed college students hijacked <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> flight 847 shortly after it took off from <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION>. Their act launched a dramatic episode that lasted for 17 days. By the time it was over, 39 men had been held hostage in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> for two weeks, a young <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> diver was dead and the plane had logged more than 8,500 miles between <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>. For the 153 passengers and crew _ 104 of the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> _ the ordeal is something they will never forget, though many have tried. `` It was n't a fun deal to go through,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Peel </PERSON>, 36, of <PERSON> Hutchinson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION> `` We really do n't like to talk about it because every time you do, it brings it up again.'' <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazurowski </PERSON>, 68, of <LOCATION> Lancaster </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, said the hijacking `` is an issue we would like to forget.'' <PERSON> Mazurowski </PERSON>'s daughter, <PERSON> Melissa </PERSON>, a recent graduate of <ORGANIZATION> Barnard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION>, still has back trouble as a result of the 30 hours they spent on the plane, her father said. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Cocoris </PERSON>, a restaurant owner from <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, said he no longer flies on <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> carriers when he visits his family in <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>. `` I think we are targeted,'' he said. Memories have been evoked recently by a television film about the flight, a book by the pilot and news reports about the upcoming trial in <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> of one of the hijackers. <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON> is scheduled to be tried in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> July 5 on charges of air piracy and murder in the death of <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Waldorf </LOCATION>, Md. The young <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> man was beaten and shot during the hijacking. <PERSON> Hamadi </PERSON>, a Lebanese Shiite thought to have ties to the radical group, <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, was arrested in January 1987 as he went through customs with explosives in his luggage. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> tried unsuccessfully to extradite him. Court spokesman <PERSON> Falk </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> said two of <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON>'s relatives and six former hostages will take part in the prosecution. <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON>'s parents could not be reached for comment Another suspect, <PERSON> Hassan </PERSON> <PERSON> Izz-Al-Din </PERSON>, was identified by passengers as one of the people who hijacked a <ORGANIZATION> Kuwaiti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> plane earlier this year, according to a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official who asked that he not be named. The department does not have official confirmation, he said. On May 2, <ORGANIZATION> NBC-TV </ORGANIZATION> aired a two-hour docudrama about the episode entitled, `` The Taking of Flight 847: The <PERSON> Uli </PERSON> <PERSON> Derickson </PERSON> <PERSON> Story </PERSON>.'' Actress <PERSON> Lindsay </PERSON> <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON> played <PERSON> Derickson </PERSON>, the purser on the flight who had close contact with the hijackers because she translated their demands from German into English during the flight. <PERSON> Mazurowski </PERSON> said the movie was `` quite factual'' though it tended to glamorize parts of the ordeal. <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheahan </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> flight attendant who has a vivid recollection of the events, said she was disappointed with what she called distortions in the movie. For instance, she said none of the passengers talked during the flight, but the film shows <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON> discussing with a friend what to do. `` The truth would have been just as compelling,'' she said. Capt. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Testrake </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Richmond </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, wrote a book last year about the hijacking which he dedicated to <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON>. `` He looked at hate and death squarely and fearlessly, and no cry was heard to come from him,'' <PERSON> Testrake </PERSON> wrote in `` Triumph Over Terror on Flight 847,'' published by <ORGANIZATION> Fleming </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> H. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` I can not describe how I felt when <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON> was killed,'' he said. `` There was just a heavy, heavy sadness that washed over me.'' In the book, which deals heavily with <PERSON> Testrake </PERSON>'s religious faith, the retired <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> pilot said he knew little about the politics of the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> until the hijacking. `` I was awakened from this typically American isolation by the black bore of an automatic pistol in my face and by the angry eyes behind it,'' he said. `` I have discovered that our country is resented in this region ...'' <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Blattner </PERSON> in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, said he had no information about any settlements offered to passengers on flight 847. One former hostage said in 1985 the company offered $ 35,000 to passengers held until the end of the 17-day crisis, and $ 15,000 to those released earlier.

<HEAD>House OKs Measure On Middlemen's Handling Of Toxic PCBs</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is moving to close a loophole in the control of PCBs, the highly toxic polychlorinated biphenyls that were banned in 1976. A bill passed by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> by voice vote Monday takes direct aim at <ORGANIZATION> PCB </ORGANIZATION> brokers, the middlemen who collect the chemicals from their use sites and arrange for their destruction. While the use and destruction of PCBs are heavily regulated, there has been no governmental control over them between the time brokers pick them up and when they deliver them to a destruction facility, such as an incinerator. Rep. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Luken </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, said the bill that moved to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> responds to reports that some brokers have improperly handled PCBs and in some instances have gone bankrupt, leaving power companies and communities to clean up storage sites. `` Literally, anyone with a truck can now get into the <ORGANIZATION> PCB </ORGANIZATION> disposal business,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Synar </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Okla </LOCATION>., a principal sponsor of the bill `` It's time to put an end to the sham these <ORGANIZATION> PCB </ORGANIZATION> operators have put on us. It's time to put them out of business.'' PCBs are most frequently found as an insulation fluid in heavy duty electrical equipment. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> banned their manufacture in 1976, but an estimated 750 million pounds are still in use or in storage. <PERSON> Luken </PERSON> said that as the electrical gear wears out over the next few years, the nation will be faced with the task of safely disposing of a growing amount of the chemicals. The bill would require <ORGANIZATION> PCB </ORGANIZATION> brokers to be registered, keep records and demonstrate financial responsibility.

<HEAD>Lightning Deaths in 1987 Highest This Decade</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Lightning deaths around the nation last year rose to the highest level in this decade, and the rate of lightning-related injuries was nearly 50 percent higher than usual, according to new government figures. Twice in 1987 lightning claimed three lives with a single bolt _ in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oceanic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atmospheric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> reported Monday. One <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> youth was n't even safe at home, in bed and under the covers. On July 31 a bolt struck his home in <LOCATION> Nantucket </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, traveled down a wall and knocked the 19-year-old out of bed. That youth was among 365 people hurt during the year, well above the 250 annual average. Eighty-six were killed _ the most since 88 died in 1978. But the total was still short of the annual average of 96 deaths. Lightning deaths have been declining in recent years, dipping to a record low of 68 fatalities in 1986 before rebounding last year. `` Lightning apparently does not command the respect it deserves as a dangerous killer,'' E. W. Friday, director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, warned in a statement. Among weather-related hazards, only flash floods kill more people annually than lightning, he said. Three golfers taking shelter under a tall tree on a hill were killed July 3 at Warrior's Path State Park near <LOCATION> Kingsport </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>. And on July 26, lightning killed three campers sleeping in tents at <LOCATION> Darien </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Genesee </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION> Scorch marks indicated that the bolt first struck the aluminum pole of one tent, killing its two occupants, then jumped six feet to another tent and electrocuted the third person On the same day a 28-year-old man was killed and three others injured at <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Russell </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION>, when struck while in a tent located near a tall tree. And just four days later a similar instance injured but spared the lives of three campers in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state. Three girls were in a tent in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, in <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, when a bolt struck a nearby tree and traveled through the root system to their tent where it melted a sleeping bag and left all three with burns. A father and son camping in the <ORGANIZATION> Boundary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Waters </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canoe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Area </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, were killed July 24 when lightning hit a white pine 20 feet from their tent. Two other people were burned. Last year's high injury list included instances in which a strike injured a group of people. Some 30 people in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heights </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, were injured in a single strike July 29, for example, when lightning hit a tree and then bounced to a metal gate where people were leaving a ball game. Some people were knocked four or five feet and two were seriously injured. In another case, on Aug. 12, 24 were injured in <LOCATION> Silver </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.M. </LOCATION>, when a bolt hit a high school football field near a group of players. The injuries, which included 18 football players, were mostly minor burns. Seven people sitting under a tree in <LOCATION> Green </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> were injured by a lightning strike July 11. A half-dozen national guardsmen were injured Aug. 4 when a bolt struck during a night exercise at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> McClellan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, while on July 24 five <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guardsmen </ORGANIZATION> standing on a seawall at <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Huron </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>, were injured by a bolt. Overall, nearly one-third of the people injured were affected by just nine strikes. As usual, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> led the nation with 11 lightning deaths last year. <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> ranked second with 6, followed by 5 in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and 4 each in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> each recorded three fatalities. There were two each in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. Recording a single lightning death for the year were <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>. In addition to deaths and injuries, extensive property damage was caused by lightning each year. For example, lightning strikes kindled more than 900 fires in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> last August, laying waste to 130,000 acres of forest land in the worst fire since the so-called <LOCATION> Telbrook </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Burn </LOCATION> in 1921. A lightning strike does n't always mean a fire, though. On July 1 a bolt ruptured the <LOCATION> Salem </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, water tower, causing a spill of 100,000 gallons.

 A reporter investigating allegations of abuse at a jail was charged Monday with illegally taking papers from prisoners. <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Olson </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Tallahassee </LOCATION> Democrat took papers from one of four prisoners she interviewed Saturday and refused to hand them over to jail officials, <LOCATION> Leon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> sheriff's officials charged.

 Most states took a turn in the 1988 campaign spotlight when their presidential primaries rolled around. The candidates came, the reporters followed, the television lights went on, and at least fifteen minutes of fame ensued. But not in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>. The state, which held the first presidential primary in the nation in 1912, holds the final presidential primary of the year today. This should be worth a little attention, right? Wrong. No Democrats bothered to file. On the Republican side, the ballot lists only <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Rachner </PERSON>, a retired <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> teacher who says the spirits of her late mother and grandmother told her to run for president. The primary `` does n't really mean anything,'' concedes <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Schlosser </PERSON>, co-chairman of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>. The vice president long ago wrapped up the 1,139 delegates needed to win the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> nomination, and <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>'s 16 delegates are expected to follow the crowd. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> underscored the insignificance of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>'s primary during a speech in <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> over the weekend that was telecast via satellite to a <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dakota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> meeting. `` The primary process is over on both sides,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. `` They're worthless,'' Secretary of State <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Meier </PERSON>, one of the Republican leaders at the meeting, said afterwards of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION>'s presidential primaries. Even so, <PERSON> Meier </PERSON> predicts as many as 100,000 voters will go to the polls Tuesday, but only because of ballot measures that would create a state lottery and repeal a tax on cable television service. `` People would be more interested in voting in the primary, if there was a reason to be there,'' said state <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> Director <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Emineth </PERSON>. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> conducted the nation's first presidential primary March 19, 1912. But the primary was dropped from 1932 until it was revived by the 1979 <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION>, which saw the election as a way to attract national attention to the state. The primary was as insignificant when it returned in 1984 after the 52-year absence as it is this year. By almost all accounts, the primary season this year wrapped up a week ago with contests in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. `` It would have been nice if <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> had more impact,'' state Sen. <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Holmberg </PERSON>, a Republican who led the effort to resurrect the presidential primary, said wistfully. `` Maybe the next time they will.''

<HEAD>Massachusetts Budget Crunch Prompts Talk Of New Taxes</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Just when the presidential campaign of <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is trying to dampen any talk about Democrats raising taxes, the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor is being forced to consider the possibility at home. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> met Monday with senior budget advisers and legislative leaders to talk about his state's budget crunch, and one participant in the meeting indicated the possibility of new taxes was discussed. Senate President <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bulger </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Keverian </PERSON> both said spending and tax issues were discussed, but no conclusions were drawn. Asked if the possibility of new taxes was talked about, <PERSON> Bulger </PERSON> said, `` Every kind of idea is being discussed.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, speaking to reporters briefly on his way out of the <ORGANIZATION> Statehouse </ORGANIZATION>, also declined to provide any specifics. `` It will evolve, it will develop. We are talking about a number of things,'' the governor said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was asked about the growing belief by some that higher taxes are inevitable. `` I do n't know if that's true at this point. We've got lots of things we are looking at and we are making good progress. And we will have a good, solid balanced budget,'' he said. The governor also declined to say whether he has asked the legislative leaders to support any new or higher taxes. With less than three weeks remaining in the fiscal year, the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> administration is facing a projected deficit of more than $ 400 million. And budget experts in the administration and in the legislature say the next fiscal year could hold more problems. The House has passed an $ 11.8 billion spending plan for next year, and that budget is pending in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. The new budget is due on July 1. The legislative leaders said Monday's discussions with the governor did not focus on any particular deadline, although they acknowledged that the problem is urgent and more meetings are planned this week. `` We're running against the clock, but I'm sure we will meet our timetables,'' <PERSON> Keverian </PERSON> said. He, too, declined to reveal details of what was discussed in the meeting. In recent weeks, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has spoken repeatedly with top lawmakers, seeking to reach a broad agreement balancing the budget for both this year and next, in time to meet the July 1 deadline. Finance Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Keefe </PERSON> said there was no consensus yet on where to cut spending or on which new taxes or fees might be needed. <PERSON> Keefe </PERSON> said he was urging <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> to sign a bill projected to raise $ 40 million by imposing a sales tax on cigarettes, which arrived on the governor's desk Monday. But he said he could not predict what <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> will do. In the course of his presidential campaign, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has leaned heavily on his reputation as a competent manager who has kept his state's budget balanced. The <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign has also resisted calls from <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> to raise taxes on the wealthy, a position <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> would like to see included in the Democratic platform. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has said tax hikes should be a last resort, and that a crackdown on tax cheats should be a first step.

<HEAD>Reagan Nominee Hit for Placing Liens on Dying AIDS Victim's

<TEXT>
 A <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration judicial nominee is under fire for placing liens on the property of a dying AIDS victim and for his membership in a private club with a record of discrimination. <PERSON> Vaughn </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, nominee for a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> district judgeship in northern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, was accused by another lawyer during a hearing Monday of keeping property liens `` hanging over a dying man.'' <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> also was questioned sharply by Sen. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON> on his continued membership in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>'s Olympic Club. <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, a member of a large <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> law firm, said he would resign unless more blacks were recruited and women members were given voting rights. <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON>, D-Vt., who presided at the <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>'s confirmation hearing, reminded the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> lawyer that <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Justice <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> quit the same club without waiting for But the most emotional issue at the hearing was <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>'s representation of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Olympic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> in its successful suit to stop an organizer for <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>'s gay community from calling an athletic competition the `` Gay Olympics. As part of the suit, <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> placed liens on the property of the late <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Waddell </PERSON>, a 1968 Olympian in the decathlon who spent the last years of his life fighting the <ORGANIZATION> USOC </ORGANIZATION>'s lawsuit before dying of AIDS. Attorney <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunlap </PERSON>, who represented <PERSON> Waddell </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> placed the liens on <PERSON> Waddell </PERSON>'s property and refused to lift them even when he knew <PERSON> Waddell </PERSON> was dying. <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> insisted there was `` nothing malicious'' in placing the liens against <PERSON> Waddell </PERSON>'s home and other property, an action that followed a federal district judge's order that <PERSON> Waddell </PERSON> and a gay organization pay the <ORGANIZATION> USOC </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 96,000 in attorney's fees. <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> told the committee that a later federal appeals court ruling during the case automatically vacated the liens. But Ms. <PERSON> Dunlap </PERSON> told the committee that she was unable to vacate the liens without <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>'s release, which he refused to give. <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> eventually gave his agreement, but the liens were not removed until six days after <PERSON> Waddell </PERSON>'s death in July 1987. Ms. <PERSON> Dunlap </PERSON> said <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> left the liens `` hanging over a dying man at the time he needed to know his daughter would inherit his estate.'' Discussing his club membership, <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> said he has been working from within to get the Olympic Club to change its policies. He said it now has an accelerated program to recruit minorities, and discussions are under way to permit the 800 women members to vote _ a privilege they do not have now. The nominee first told senators that he would resign if the committee asked him to do so. Told by <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON> that there were no plans for such a request, <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> said that if the current efforts stall and a `` hopeless situation'' results, `` then I would resign regardless of whether the committee thought I should resign or not.'' But he added, `` I think the club is making progress.'' <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> has drawn opposition from <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>'s gay community and the city's Board of Supervisors, which voted unanimously against the nomination. His main supporter, Republican Sen. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, urged the committee not to turn against <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> because of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Olympic Committee case. `` What principle of American jurisprudence is more fundamental than that due process of the law requires that however unpopular a client, that client and that client's cause of action are entitled to be represented by competent counsel?'' <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> asked. <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> used similar language in defending himself, telling <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON> `` I was perfectly aware of how unpopular the position was.'' But he added that the committee should be looking for judicial candidates `` willing to take stands'' that are legally correct `` even though they may be unpopular.'' <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> said the Olympic committee held firm on the lien, adding it did so in the hope that the gay organization working with <PERSON> Waddell </PERSON> _ <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Francisco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Athletics </ORGANIZATION> _ would raise the money for the attorney fees. <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON> also used the hearing to respond to an accusation last month by the committee's ranking Republican, <PERSON> Strom </PERSON> <PERSON> Thurmond </PERSON> of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, that majority Democrats were intentionally delaying 13 current and former <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> judicial nominees. <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON>, who is in charge of judicial confirmation hearings, said the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> caused some delays through tardiness in responding to committee information requests on nominees. He said other delays resulted because Democrats want to investigate nominees thoroughly `` before they are given a lifetime charter to sit in judgment on the rights and liberties of the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people, not afterwards.''

<TEXT>
 Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> it will have no role in superpower nuclear weapons reductions and he ignored the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s invitation to ban nuclear tests. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, addressing a special <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> session on disarmament Monday, instead stressed the momentum for arms control achieved during the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. `` We have made major progress toward a treaty to cut <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet strategic nuclear arsenals -LRB- long-range missiles -RRB- by 50 percent,'' he said. `` I do not know whether we will be able to conclude such a treaty this year, but we will make our best effort. `` It is the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>' top arms control priority,'' he added. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s speech underlined past accomplishments, including the newly ratified U.S.-Soviet treaty to destroy intermediate-range nuclear missiles and the verification procedures that go with it. Last week, Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> used a speech to the conference to call on the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to take on future disarmament challenges. He proposed abolishing all nuclear weapons by the year 2000, an immediate mutual ban on nuclear tests and an immediate cut of 500,000 troops each from the <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> replied that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will `` concentrate on results which will eliminate the disparities -LRB- in conventional arms in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> -RRB- that threaten stability, not schemes for ` equal reductions' which will have no such effect.'' <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> claims the Soviets have an advantage in conventional arms in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. In the speech, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> also ignored the Soviet call for a mutual test ban. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> similarly failed to join a 1 -LCB- - year unilaterial Soviet moratorium on testing that began in August 1985 <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> also rejected the Soviet call for a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> arms reduction verification agency to coordinate and monitor disarmament pacts. `` Some tasks, such as work to reduce nuclear arsenals, must be strictly bilateral, in negotiation, verification, and implementation.'' `` But others,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said, `` above all, the negotiations to ban chemical weapons, and the need to control nuclear proliferation _ are global problems.'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> offered no specific proposals on those problems. `` Ballistic missile proliferation is a new and urgent challenge,'' particularly in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>. His advice to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> was to exercise `` mutual restraint'' and not buy or launch such missiles. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> urged nations attending the Conference on Disarmament to `` apply themselves'' to a global ban on chemical weapons, which are easily made in fertilizer and pesticide factories, but did not suggest any solutions. The potential spread of nuclear weapons to other countries, especially in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, is a central topic in the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION>'s session on disarmament and <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> urged rivals <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> to work on the problem. Earlier in the day, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> offered to sign the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty if <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> does so simultaneously. Later this week, delegates to the 159-member <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> will begin drafting resolutions on chemical, nuclear, conventional and space-based weapons for this third special session on disarmament in 10 years. The session, scheduled to end June 25, has been sharply divided. Diplomatic observers said it will be difficult to draft a final document. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and Western allies have called for pragmatic steps in arms control, respect for nuclear deterrence, a limited role for the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> and recognition that bilateral arms talks must supersede multilateral efforts. Western diplomats also have said that conventional disarmament is as important as nuclear disarmament, and urged poor developing nations that clamor for nuclear disarmament to cut their own armies and avoid sweeping and utopian disarmament proposals.

 Former Gov. <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> has lost a mistrial bid on the eve of closing arguments in his trial on charges of concealing a $ 350,000 campaign loan. Attorneys were to give closing arguments this morning, and the jury was expected to begin deliberations in the afternoon. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> and his brother, <PERSON> Willard </PERSON>, are charged in the <ORGANIZATION> Maricopa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> trial with concealing the $ 350,000 loan in financial reports required by the state. In a motion for mistrial, defense attorney <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> contended that Judge <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> may have prejudiced the case by expressing surprise when the prosecution and defense said Friday they had no more witnesses. The defense rested its case without calling either <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> or <PERSON> Willard </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> to the stand. After the prosecution said it had no rebuttal witnesses, <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> told the jurors the sudden close of testimony had taken him by surprise. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> argued Monday that the judge's statement could be interpreted by the jury as implying that the defense should have presented more testimony or put the defendants on the stand. But <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> said he made the comment in the context of the trial schedule. In addition, he said he did not see how the defense could be harmed since he made the remark afterthe prosecution said it had no rebuttal witnesses. <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> also denied a defense request Monday that he interview each juror privately to find out if any had seen any publicity about the case. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> was charged with six felony counts of perjury, willful concealment and filing false documents, and faces up to 22 years in prison if convicted. <PERSON> Willard </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, who was his younger brother's 1986 campaign treasurer, faced three similar counts and up to 9 -LCB- years in prison if convicted The defense has contended the $ 350,000 loan from developer <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolfson </PERSON> was properly reported as part of a $ 465,000 lump sum listed as a contribution from <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, and that the failure to itemize the loan was an innocent mistake. Former top <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> aide <PERSON> Edith </PERSON> <PERSON> Richardson </PERSON> said the loan was common knowledge among the former <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> governor's inner circle. But two other former top aides, <PERSON> Donna </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mac </PERSON> <PERSON> Matheson </PERSON>, said they did not know about it. The prosecution has said that <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> badly needed the loan to keep his gubernatorial campaign afloat but wanted to keep it secret to avoid harming the candidate's theme of being `` beholden to no one.'' In addition, prosecutors said it did n't matter whether <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s closest aides knew about the loan because it was not reported to the public <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> took office in January 1987 and was removed April 4 when the state <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> convicted him of two unrelated charges. He also was impeached in connection with the loan, but the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> decided not to hear that charge for fear of prejudicing his criminal trial.

 State troopers removed dozens of children from a church whose fundamentalist preacher was arrested twice Monday after harboring youngsters in defiance of a court order. About 60 state troopers, local police and sheriff's deputies moved into <ORGANIZATION> Bethel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> after a 4-hour standoff. At least seven people, including the assistant pastor of the church, were arrested. After interviews, 11 children were handed over to state welfare officials. It was unclear if they had been residents of the Rev. <PERSON> Herman </PERSON> <PERSON> Fountain </PERSON>'s 28-acre <LOCATION> Bethel </LOCATION> Home for Children, where officials charge youngsters have been abused through corporal punishment. Witnesses said at least three dozen children were taken from the church. Authorities said they took all the youngsters away after church officials refused to point out three who Fountain acknowledged in court had returned to the home after it was temporarily closed by a judge. As the children were being taken into the local courthouse, Fountain got into a shoving match with a lawman and was re-arrested. He was arrested earlier along with two staff members and a 17-year-old when a fight broke out at the home, leading Chancery Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Oswald </PERSON> to call for a grand jury to consider indicting Fountain. Fountain had refused to answer the judge's questions about runaways from the home in a hearing earlier Monday. The judge issued 11 subpoenas to staff members of the home, apparently leading somehow to the fight. On Friday, the judge had given state welfare officials temporary custody of youngsters at the home, on the campus of the independent <ORGANIZATION> Bethel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> near <LOCATION> Lucedale </LOCATION>. The state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Welfare </ORGANIZATION> removed some 60 children, but many others fled. <PERSON> Oswald </PERSON> ruled that children, ages 10 to 17, had been subjected `` to physical abuse, medical neglect and detention amounting to imprisonment.'' `` This court's message is simple _ abuse and neglect of children is not acceptable at any time or any place by any person,'' <PERSON> Oswald </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Oswald </PERSON> said that <PERSON> Fountain </PERSON> was wrong to think that since his school is part of his church he is n't subject to civil authorities. The judge said he would first decide the cases of 12 children whose parents retained a lawyer and refused to sign an agreement not to send their youngsters back to the home. During a morning break, <PERSON> Fountain </PERSON> said he believed his home housed `` about 120 children.'' Twenty-two of 64 children taken into custody by state workers were released over the weekend to their parents or guardians, state Welfare Commissioner <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brittain </PERSON> said Monday outside the court. <PERSON> Brittain </PERSON> said some of the 42 had been brought to court Monday but they never testified. Asked about the children unaccounted for, <PERSON> Fountain </PERSON> said: `` I do n't know anything about them. If I had enough money to hire a private investigator to find them, I would do that. I love those kids.'' <PERSON> Fountain </PERSON> said he feared for the safety of the missing youngsters because most had a troubled history; he was worried, he said, some might return to using drugs. About 50 people attended the court session, some wearing pro-Fountain buttons that read `` Eternal Life Is a Free Gift.'' After several outbursts in the court that included moans, crying and comments that the judge was prejudicial, <PERSON> Oswald </PERSON> said: `` There is a place for demonstrations, but it is not the courtroom. There may be a place for outcries, but it is not the courtroom.'' Outside court, several parents said they wanted their children back in the home rather than in the state's custody. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Boca </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Raton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, who said she had a 16-year-old son at <LOCATION> Bethel </LOCATION>, said she and her husband refused to pick him up because they did not want to sign the agreement that would bar him from return to <LOCATION> Bethel </LOCATION>. `` We chose to have our children in a religious facility that works,'' she said. `` And the state has put their hands in it ... the state is taking away our rights. `` Brother Fountain through <LOCATION> Bethel </LOCATION> saved our child's life. When a child is on drugs, you need the help of religion to get off drugs.''

<HEAD>Israel Hits Again At The Purse In New Effort To End Uprising</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 In a new effort to end the Palestinian anti-occupation uprising, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> plans to force <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> parents to post cash bonds to free children detained in clashes with <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops. Police, meanwhile, announced that they would step up aerial patrols to spot arsonists. A tenth Arab arson suspect was seized Monday night as he fled a burning wooded area near <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, Israeli radio reported. A military source said that to curb the daily violence in the occupied <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, authorities would make parents of detained children deposit cash bonds rather than promissory notes to keep their youngsters off the streets. The death count continued to mount in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, where Palestinians have for six months been revolting against the 21-year Israeli occupation. <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers fatally shot 43-year-old <PERSON> Mahmoud </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> village of <LOCATION> Abwein </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION> on Monday when he did not heed an order to halt, said Dr. <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Obeid </PERSON>, director of the <LOCATION> Ramallah </LOCATION> hospital. The victim's family said <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> was hard of hearing and probably did not hear the order. A military spokesman said the army was checking into the death, which brought the total number of Palestinian fatalities in the uprising to 207. Two Israelis have been slain. The military source who reported the cash-bond plan said <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> parents would have to pay 5,000 shekels, about $ 3,100, to obtain the release of their children detained for the first time. The money would be confiscated as a fine if the children were detained a second time, he said. Previously, families could sign a document guaranteeing to pay the amount if the suspects were arrested again after being released. `` It has to be seen in the context of a whole series of actions we have taken to reduce violence,'' said the source, who was not idenfitied in line with army regulations. An Arab resident of <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> said new fines amounting to the equivalent of $ 9,500 against homeowners whose houses were painted with <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> slogans have virtually eliminated such graffiti. `` When people see writing on the wall they take it off and do a whitewash _ they're frightened and do n't want to put themselves in trouble,'' said the resident, who asked not to be named in fear of reprisal. Officials reported more brush and forest fires Monday night in central <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, and they blamed Palestinian arsonists. Fires in recent weeks have destroyed at least 25,000 acres of grazing areas, forests and nature reserves, according to naturalists. Police reported the arrest Monday night of a 26-year-old Arab suspected of committing arson in the Ben-Shemen park along the <ORGANIZATION> Tel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviv-Jerusalem </ORGANIZATION> highway. They said a second forest fire was set near the Orthodox Kefar Habad Hassidic settlement, three miles from <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>, and residents reported seeing two people fleeing the scene, according to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio. In earlier arrests over the weekend, police seized six Arabs for allegedly setting fires in the <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> area and three others in connection with forest fires in the northern <LOCATION> Galilee </LOCATION> region. Foreign Minster <PERSON> Shimon </PERSON> <PERSON> Peres </PERSON> told Israelis Monday not to `` get hysterical'' about the fires. He said <PERSON> Arab </PERSON> militants are `` always looking for new means and new places. We must develop counter measures ... for this very injurious assault.''

<HEAD>Aspirin Packages To Carry Stronger Warning on Reye Syndrome</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Packages of aspirin are required to carry stronger warning labels against giving aspirin to children and teen-agers with chicken pox or flu because of the danger of <ORGANIZATION> Reye </ORGANIZATION> syndrome under new federal rules. <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> published regulations Monday after a <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> study found a significant association between Reye syndrome and taken aspirin during chicken pox or flu. The new warning, a modification of one already required on aspirin and aspirin-containing drugs, says: `` WARNING: Children and teen-agers should not use this medicine for chicken pox or flu symptoms before a doctor is consulted about <PERSON> Reye </PERSON> syndrome, a rare but serious illness reported to be associated with aspirin.'' For one year, aspirin and aspirin products must display an attention-getting device, such as a flag on the label, alerting consumers to the new and stronger Reye syndrome warning. Reye syndrome is fatal in 20 percent to 30 percent of cases, and some survivors suffer permanent brain damage. Its symptoms _ severe tiredness, belligerence and excessive vomiting _ may occur just as a child or teen-ager appears to be recovering from flu or chicken pox.

<HEAD>Government Bans Freed ANC Leader From Meeting With More Than 10 At

<TEXT>
 The government has banned <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Govan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mbeki </PERSON> from being in the company of more than 10 people at a time, his attorney said. <PERSON> Mbeki </PERSON>, 77, freed from a life prison term last year, is not allowed to attend rallies or meetings, his attorney, <PERSON> Priscilla </PERSON> <PERSON> Jana </PERSON>, said Monday. The congress is the main guerrilla group fighting the South African government, whose apartheid system denies the country's 26 million blacks a voice in national affairs. The 5 million whites control the economy and maintain separate schools, districts and health services. <PERSON> Mbeki </PERSON> already had been prohibited from addressing meetings, giving interviews or leaving the area near the city of <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Elizabeth </LOCATION>, where he lives. The new order limiting the number of people he can be with is a common measure used by the government to punish anti-apartheid activists. Ms. <PERSON> Jana </PERSON> said another of her clients, <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> co-president <PERSON> Albertina </PERSON> <PERSON> Sisulu </PERSON>, was served with similar new orders. Mrs. <PERSON> Sisulu </PERSON>, wife of imprisoned <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> official <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Sisulu </PERSON>, was one of 18 black activists whose movements and speech had already been restricted in February. The front, a coalition of anti-apartheid groups, was banned in February from all activity along with 17 other anti-apartheid organizations. Mrs. <PERSON> Jana </PERSON> said <PERSON> Mbeki </PERSON> filed a court challenge to the first restrictions placed on him but will have to refile the appeal under the new regulations. <PERSON> Mbeki </PERSON> was freed last August after serving 23 years for a 1964 conviction on charges of sabotage.

<TEXT>
 Four Bolshevik leaders who were purged, convicted and died during <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s terror of the 1930s have been exonerated in the Kremlin's latest revision of Soviet history. The <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s ruling is a signal that open debate will be allowed on reform proposals at a special <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> conference this month. The court reversed the convictions of <LOCATION> Lev </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kamenev </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Zinoviev </PERSON> and <PERSON> Karl </PERSON> <PERSON> Radek </PERSON> and the lesser-known <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Pyatikov </PERSON>, the government newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> reported Monday. The move restores `` to these tragic figures their honor and their names,'' the paper said. The ruling does not mean complete rehabilitation unless their <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> membership is restored. The decision had been expected since February, when the court reversed the death sentence of <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bukharin </PERSON>, another old Bolshevik killed in the purges. <PERSON> Kamenev </PERSON> and <PERSON> Zinoviev </PERSON> were as important as <PERSON> Bukharin </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> said the court `` did not evaluate whether they were right or wrong in the old debates. But it said clearly: They are innocent before the law, state, and people.'' The article directed extraordinarily harsh criticism at <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>, who killed many former comrades during the terror he used to shape the Soviet economy and society while he ruled the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> from 1927 to 1953. Since assuming power March 15, 1985, <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has been dismantling much of the Stalinist governing structure. Monday's court decision was another step in that process. At the party conference, scheduled to start June 28, delegates will debate proposals to widen the scope of <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s `` perestroika,'' a reform program that some midlevel party and government officials are resisting Clearing <PERSON> Bukharin </PERSON> was essential because he broke with <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s policy of rapid industrialization in the 1930s and advocated policies similar to those <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is pursuing <PERSON> Zinoviev </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kamenev </PERSON> are not identified as closely as <PERSON> Bukharin </PERSON> with specific policies, but <PERSON> Izvestia </PERSON> made clear that exonerating them was intended to foster debate. `` We are learning democracy, mastering the rules of political discussions, also in a time of hard struggle,'' it said in a long article under the headline `` A Return to Truth.'' <PERSON> Zinoviev </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kamenev </PERSON> spent years in exile with <PERSON> Vladimir </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON>, the Bolshevik leader, and returned to <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION> with him in February 1917. They opposed <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON>'s decision in October of that year to begin the Bolshevik Revolution, but were forgiven and named to party posts. When <PERSON> Lenin </PERSON> died in 1924, <PERSON> Zinoviev </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kamenev </PERSON> sided with <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> against <PERSON> Leon </PERSON> <PERSON> Trotsky </PERSON>, who was driven into exile and murdered in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> in 1940. <PERSON> Trotsky </PERSON> has not been rehabilitated, but several recent articles have dealt with his role in the revolution. After <PERSON> Trotsky </PERSON> was exiled, <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> turned on his former allies. <PERSON> Zinoviev </PERSON> and <PERSON> Kamenev </PERSON> were convicted of treason and executed after a show trial in 1936. <PERSON> Radek </PERSON>, born in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, took part in the 1917 revolution but was accused of siding with <PERSON> Trotsky </PERSON> and expelled from the party in 1927. He was rehabilitated and edited <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION> in the 1930s, but was tried again in 1937 and sent to a labor camp, where he is believed to have died in about 1940. <PERSON> Pyatikov </PERSON> led the left wing of the Ukrainian <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> in 1917 and later held government posts. He was sentenced along with <PERSON> Radek </PERSON> and executed. `` Our predecessors, the people of the 20s, could not control the situation ... and were burned up in the flames of repression,'' <ORGANIZATION> Izvestia </ORGANIZATION>'s legal correspondent, <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Feofanov </PERSON>, wrote in a detailed account of the purges. `` They preached intolerance toward the opinions of their opponents and gave birth to physical and moral terror,'' he wrote. `` In a word, discussion has been cut off for a long time about the paths toward the building of socialism. It has been restored now, more than a half century later, and from the same place; about the paths of developing revolution, about the role of the party and about the place of ` the Vozhd.''' <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON> was known as the `` Vozhd'' _ supreme leader.

<TEXT>
 The government of Socialist President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> and all of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> wrestled with a political identity crisis after legislative elections raised more questions than they answered. <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> called the elections hoping for a Socialist majority in the 577-seat <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>. Polls initially predicted he would succeed. But he did n't, although the opposing center-right alliance lost the majority it won in 1986. <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> was bereft of a governing majority for the first time in 30 years. `` The country is exhausted from having voted too much,'' the influential <ORGANIZATION> Le </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monde </ORGANIZATION> newspaper declared Monday. `` It has had enough of politicians' games. It is up to the president, everybody says it and everybody is right, to act.'' Yet the president likely will find action difficult. Sunday's election was a defeat for <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON>, who won his second seven-year term as president May 8 with 54 percent of the vote. <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> has in recent times largely abandoned Socialist principles and talked of an opening to the center. On Sunday, many French voters balked at his party's candidates. <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> was making no announcements about his strategy after Sunday's elections. But it was clear he could end up with a bruised political ego in courting balky centrists or Communists. `` There is only one conclusion to draw from these failures,'' said <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Monde </PERSON>: `` All arrogance henceforth is forbidden to those who govern us or hope to do so. Nobody can pretend to incarnate the will of the people.'' The Socialists tried to act like victors. <PERSON> Lionel </PERSON> <PERSON> Jospin </PERSON>, the Socialist education minister, said: `` One thing is sure: the right can not govern.'' All the rightist votes together would not make a majority, which <PERSON> Jospin </PERSON> said `` can only be built around the <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>,'' the largest single group in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>. But Socialists will need help from either the reluctant far left or center. The most logical approach for <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> and his premier, <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Rocard </PERSON>, would be a coalition with the Communists, whose 27 seats would make a total of 304 for the left. Second on the list of possibilities is an attempt to entice at least 13 centrist deputies from the rightist camp. Or <PERSON> Rocard </PERSON> could attempt a minority government at least until autumn, trying to find a majority for each issue. Socialist and <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> leaders have made deals and alliances in the past, but this time <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Georges </PERSON> <PERSON> Marchais </PERSON> is saying no. <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> can not make deals with the center-right and the Communists at the same time, <PERSON> Marchais </PERSON> has declared, and his party will judge the government on an issue-by-issue basis. <PERSON> Jean-Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Gaudin </PERSON>, leader of the Union for French Democracy in the outgoing assembly, said of the second possibility: `` If they persist today in wanting to detach a few centrist personalities in order to turn them into Socialists, I trust my elected centrist friends to reject this proposition, which would be unworthy of them.'' Other centrists are more open to the idea of helping the Socialists. <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Stasi </PERSON>, another centrist, said: `` If a very large union is going to be constituted, which seems desirable to me, the center must be the pivot.'' Except for two seats from <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Polynesia </LOCATION> to be decided June 26, final results gave the Socialists 276 seats and Communists 27. The center-right <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> French </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION> had 129, the conservative Rally for the Republic 126 and minor rightists 16 for a total of 271. A majority requires 289. The Communist Party dropped eight seats. The far-right <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> got one seat instead of the previous 35, and it did not go to party leader <PERSON> Jean-Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Le </PERSON> <PERSON> Pen </PERSON>.

 A man who romanced a gas station cashier, robbed her and fatally bludgeoned her died early Tuesday in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>'s electric chair. It was the 100th <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> execution since capital punishment was reinstituted. Lawyers for <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, 28, used up all their options Monday when <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Pardon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> refused to recommend a commutation of the death sentence and then the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> refused to delay the execution. Other state and federal courts refused earlier Monday to stop the third execution in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> this year and the state's 18th since the 1976 <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling allowing states to resume use of the death penalty. <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON> was executed at the <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> <LOCATION> State </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penitentiary </LOCATION> for his admitted August 1984 hammer slaying of <PERSON> Roberta </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, who was 25 at the time. A coroner pronounced him dead at 12:12 a.m., said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>, deputy state corrections secretary. When he arrived in the death chamber, <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON> showed no emotion. Asked if he had any final words, <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON> smiled slightly, shook his head and replied, `` Nope.'' After being strapped into the electric chair and masked, <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON> drummed his fingers while awaiting the first of a series of surges of electricity. Six pro-capital punishment demonstrators stood outside the prison. One carried a sign that read: `` Thanks, <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>,'' alluding to the pseudonym used to protect the anonymity of the penitentiary's executioner. The sign-carrier identified himself as <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Reece </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Pineville </LOCATION> and said he felt deprived because his daughter's killer was sentenced to life imprisonment. `` It gives us a sense of justice to see this done to him -LRB- <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON> -RRB-,'' <PERSON> Reece </PERSON> said. `` It does n't make me happy to see someone die, but it gives me a sense of satisfaction to see justice served.'' <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON> was calm as he ate his final meal at the <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION> State Penitentiary Monday night after spending much of the day alone with his lawyers, Warden <PERSON> Hilton </PERSON> <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> said. No relatives visited <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON> and he asked for no spritual adviser, though prison chaplains would have been available if <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON> had changed his mind, said <PERSON> Butler </PERSON>. At Monday's <ORGANIZATION> Pardon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> hearing, <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON> was described by defense attorneys <PERSON> Amanda </PERSON> <PERSON> Potterfield </PERSON> and <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Baumgartner </PERSON> as a sensitive, articulate jailhouse poet who helped other inmates write letters to loved ones. Four of the five pardon board members who heard <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON>'s case voted against a lighter sentence. A fifth member was absent. The Pardon Board has no power to stop executions, but can recommend sentence reductions for approval by Gov. <PERSON> Buddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON>. <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON> admitted he started dating <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> because he knew she handled large sums of money at the service station where she worked. But he insisted he never meant to kill her. <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> died after being struck repeatedly with a ball peen hammer. `` I just attempted to knock her unconscious,'' <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Pardon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>. `` It did n't work.'' <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON>'s application to the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> for a stay was denied with the standard dissent by Justices <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Thurgood </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>, who dissent to all executions, said court spokeswoman <PERSON> Toni </PERSON> <PERSON> House </PERSON>. Justices <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Blackmun </PERSON> and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> indicated they also would have granted the stay, Ms. <PERSON> House </PERSON> said, but noted that it takes five justices to grant such a stay. A second application also was denied with dissents by <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>, with <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON> indicating he also would have granted the stay, she said. At the <ORGANIZATION> Pardon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> hearing, which took place at the prison, defense lawyers had <PERSON> Yousef </PERSON> <PERSON> Danesh </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> professor of political science, read poetry by <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON>. <PERSON> Baumgartner </PERSON> said <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON> was a young man deeply remorseful about the death he had unintentionally caused. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, painted <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON> as a manipulative rogue and cold, calculating killer. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON> had been caught in a <LOCATION> Leesville </LOCATION> hotel room the morning after the killing with a barmaid he had picked up at a nearby tavern and had proposed marriage to. Parked outside was a car <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON> had stolen from the woman he lived with before getting involved with <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, the prosecutor said.

 Canadian residents were advised by their embassy to wear pins or flags with their nation's emblem during last week's scare over a potential terrorist attack against <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens The embassy, in notices sent out Friday to the approximately 150 Canadians in the Chinese capital, also recommended that hotels and other places frequented by North Americans be avoided, Embassy First Secretary E.C. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said. The notice said Canadians should try to identify themselves through flags or pins because it is difficult for terrorists to distinguish between Americans and Canadians, <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said. It also provided tips on security, `` but the basic message was that this is not a serious threat to Canadians.'' The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> issued a warning Thursday to the more than 1,500 Americans in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>, saying the <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> government had information that unidentified third-country terrorists might attack Americans. The warning, unprecedented in the Chinese capital, was canceled Sunday after the Chinese government gave assurances the danger was over.

 North Dakotans today got the second chance in two years to vote on a lottery, while voters in <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>'s 5th District will fill the seat vacated when Rep. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON>, a conservative Democrat, died during his 10th term. In <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Bean-Jones </PERSON>, an heiress to the L.L.

The winner will face Democratic Rep. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON>, a former two-term governor now in his first term in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> House. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> also has congressional primaries today. In the 6th District, Democratic Rep. <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Tallon </PERSON> faces a challenge from <PERSON> Luther </PERSON> <PERSON> Lighty </PERSON>. The <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> lottery is opposed by former Gov. <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Link </PERSON>, who says it constitutes a regressive tax on poorer citizens, and by charities that are allowed to run casino gambling and fear the competition. The measure failed two years ago, but backers predicte success this time, helped by increased public awareness of flourishing lotteries in neighboring <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>. Twenty-six states and the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> operate lotteries. <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> are scheduled to start them this summer. Voters in neighboring <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> are to decide in November whether to allow one. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> is the only state that has voted down a state-run lottery. In <LOCATION> Danville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> appeared at a rally and barbecue Sunday on behalf of Republican <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Arey </PERSON>, who faces Democrat <PERSON> L.F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Payne </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> in the special congressional election. <PERSON> Mrs. </PERSON> <PERSON> Arey </PERSON>, a former <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration official in the Education, <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> and Transportation departments, said she hoped the visit would show voters she has the connections to get things done in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Payne </PERSON> developed <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>'s Wintergreen resort and ski area. The <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> primary heated up last week when <PERSON> Bean-Jones </PERSON> was quoted in the <ORGANIZATION> Kennebec </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Augusta </LOCATION> as calling the minimum wage an `` oppressive'' law that keeps people from working and saying she would vote to abolish the $ 3.35 standard. <PERSON> O'Meara </PERSON> labeled her position `` incredible'' and `` an affront'' to workers who rely on the minimum to make ends meet. <PERSON> Bean-Jones </PERSON> later issued a statement saying she thought she had been asked about a pending bill to increase the minimum wage, but her statement did not disclaim her comments in the story. The latest campaign spending reports show that Bean-Jones had raised nearly $ 377,000 _ nearly $ 280,000 in self-secured loans _ through May 25. <PERSON> O'Meara </PERSON>'s total was $ 52,000.

<HEAD>Ozal and Papandreou Disagree Over Divided Cyprus</HEAD>

<DATELINE>VOULIAGMENI, Greece (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The premiers of <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> failed to agree over how to end their 14-year division of <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> despite improved relations between the two <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> members. `` In the general climate of detente ... it would be strange if <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> remained an example of an unsettled and dangerous irregularity,'' Premier <PERSON> Andreas </PERSON> <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> said at a dinner Monday at a tightly guarded seaside hotel outside <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION>. Visiting Premier <PERSON> Turgut </PERSON> <PERSON> Ozal </PERSON> indicated he will not give in to Greek pressure for troop withdrawals from northern <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> and said there `` is no room for petty designs, one-sided gains and shortsighted tactics.'' In central <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION>, about 2,000 <ORGANIZATION> Greek </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cypriot </ORGANIZATION>, Armenian and Kurdish demonstrators shouted, `` Fire for the Turkish dogs!'' and burned <LOCATION> Turkish </LOCATION> flags and an effigy of <PERSON> Ozal </PERSON> outside the Turkish Embassy. The fires capped a day of anti-Ozal protests that began when 60 <ORGANIZATION> Greek </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cypriot </ORGANIZATION> women, some relatives of people missing since the 1974 Turkish invasion of <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, blocked the two gateways to the Acropolis temples. More protests were set for today, the second day of <PERSON> Ozal </PERSON>'s three-day visit, when the Turkish premier planned to lay a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Warrior outside <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON>, speaking at the poolside dinner, also said <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> could not ignore the <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> problem for `` legal, moral and national reasons.'' The Socialist premier reiterated an earlier proposal for the demilitarization of the eastern <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> island and setting up a mixed <LOCATION> Greek </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cypriot </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Turkish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cypriot </LOCATION> police force. Last week, <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> also called for <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> to make a gesture by reducing its estimated 29,000-strong force in the island's northern sector. <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> has been divided into separate Greek Cypriot and Turkish Cypriot sectors since 1974, when the military junta then in power in <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> backed a coup aimed at uniting the island with <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>. The action triggered a Turkish invasion, and the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> has since policed the Green Line that divides the island. A total of 1,619 Greeks and Greek Cypriots still are missing since the invasion, and <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> has not accounted for their fate. <PERSON> Ozal </PERSON> is the first Turkish premier to visit <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> in 36 years. In 1952, Premier <PERSON> Adnan </PERSON> <PERSON> Menderes </PERSON> received a warm welcome in <LOCATION> Athens </LOCATION> at a time of Greek-Turkish detente. The atmosphere is sharply different this time, with 5,000 Greek police detailed to protect the Turkish premier. He will be confined mostly to one wing of the Vouliagmeni hotel complex. <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> also is staying in the state-owned hotel on a peninsula jutting into the <LOCATION> Saronic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>, where he spends much of his time in the summer. During the meetings, two <ORGANIZATION> Greek </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> patrol boats cruise in the gulf and frogmen in rubber boats ride close to the shore. The only sign that the Turkish premier is visiting is a red-and-white Turkish flag flying opposite a blue-and-white Greek flag at the hotel's front gate. <PERSON> Ozal </PERSON>'s visit is the latest move to improve relations after a Greek-Turkish summit at the Swiss ski resort of <LOCATION> Davos </LOCATION> in January. Fifteen months ago <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> nearly went to war over oil-drilling rights in the <LOCATION> Aegean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>, which apparently persuaded <PERSON> Papandreou </PERSON> to change his hard-line policy toward <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>.

 City officials who investigated complaints <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Karajan </PERSON> improperly called off too many <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> Philharmonic orchestra concerts decided that, despite the criticism, they need the legendary conductor. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> cultural affairs chief <PERSON> Volker </PERSON> <PERSON> Hassemer </PERSON> said Monday that the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> voted to support the 80-year-old <PERSON> Karajan </PERSON>'s continued work with the orchestra. `` <PERSON> Karajan </PERSON>'s name is important for the Philharmonic,'' said <PERSON> Hassemer </PERSON>, who has himself criticized the conductor for frequent cancellations of domestic concerts. A <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committee had been reviewing its contract with <PERSON> Karajan </PERSON>, the orchestra's conductor for life, after he called off an appearance in <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> in April because of illness and then flew to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> for a 10-day tour with the orchestra the next day. <PERSON> Karajan </PERSON> has suffered serious medical problems in recent years, including severe back pains that have forced him to cancel conducting appearances. But critics said several concerts were canceled under questionable circumstances. Philharmonic fans also complained in angry letters to newspapers about <PERSON> Karajan </PERSON>'s infrequent appearances in <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. In November, <PERSON> Karajan </PERSON> announced he could not mount the podium in <LOCATION> Duesseldorf </LOCATION> because he had food poisoning from tainted fish. He later changed his mind and performed but called off his appearance in <LOCATION> Stuttgart </LOCATION> during the same tour. <PERSON> Karajan </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> contract calls for him to conduct about a dozen concerts a year. <PERSON> Hassemer </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> would make sure the contract was fulfilled in the future.

 A landmark jury verdict gives a smoker's widower $ 400,000 in damages, the first time a tobacco company has been ordered to pay money for disease caused by cigarettes But the three tobacco companies sued called the verdict a victory and the jury's award a vote of sympathy for the bereaved husband of <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON>, who died of lung cancer after smoking 1 -LCB- packs a day for 40 years. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> jury Monday exonerated the cigarette makers <ORGANIZATION> Liggett </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Lorillard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of conspiring to mislead the public about smoking's dangers, and rejected punitive damages. Instead, it decided <ORGANIZATION> Liggett </ORGANIZATION> failed to warn about the dangers of cigarettes and violated its promise, or `` express warranty,'' to produce a safe product. It awarded <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON> damages on the warranty claim but not for the failure to warn the public because it found his wife was 80 percent responsible for contracting the disease that killed her in 1984 at age 58. <ORGANIZATION> Liggett </ORGANIZATION> faced additional charges because it manufactured the Chesterfields and <ORGANIZATION> L </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ms that Mrs. <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON> smoked before 1966, when <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> ordered health warnings on cigarette packs. Mrs. <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON> later used brands by <ORGANIZATION> Lorillard </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION>, smoking even after having part of her lung removed in 1981. <ORGANIZATION> Liggett </ORGANIZATION> attorneys promised an appeal. <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON>'s lawyers said they would ask the judge to overturn the decision not to award posthumous damages to Mrs. <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON>. The $ 35 billion tobacco industry mounted an elaborate defense _ one analyst put the cost at $ 50 million _ to avoid a judgment that might unleash a flood of multimillion-dollar lawsuits. Reaction to the verdict, which followed five days of deliberations, focused on its potential impact on hundreds of such cases pending around the nation. <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON>'s attorneys said the decision showed the tobacco industry is not invincible. `` Any time a jury awards a $ 400,000 verdict, I do n't think you can take it too lightly, particularly in a situation where five years ago people thought we were crazy and when for the past 30 years people have failed,'' said <PERSON> Marc </PERSON> <PERSON> Z. </PERSON> <PERSON> Edell </PERSON>, <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON>'s lawyer. Fewer than a dozen of about 300 smoker lawsuits have gone to juries and the tobacco industry has not paid a dollar in damages. Most of the other cases withered in the face of the well-heeled tobacco industry's legal forces. `` All I know is that we're not another notch in their gun,'' said <PERSON> Edell </PERSON>. But some said the damages awarded might not be enough to encourage other lawsuits. `` Are you going to sue if all you're going to get is $ 400,000?'' asked tobacco industry analyst <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaplan </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Financial markets were closed when the verdict came in but <PERSON> Kaplan </PERSON> predicted no long-term negative impact on tobacco stocks. `` Plaintiff attorneys can not be encouraged by the small size of the award, which pales in comparison to the $ 3 million they spent in time and money to try this case,'' said a joint statement from <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Bleakley </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Northrip </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Lorillard </ORGANIZATION>, both <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> based. `` The fact that the jury awarded no damages to Mrs. <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON> was a clear signal from the jury that smoking is a matter of personal choice and responsibility,'' said <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Hilburg </PERSON>, spokesman for <LOCATION> Durham </LOCATION>, N.C.-based <ORGANIZATION> Liggett </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Liggett </ORGANIZATION> attorney <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohn </PERSON> said he regarded the award as `` sympathy'' for <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON>, a 64-year-old retired cable splicer from <LOCATION> Lakehurst </LOCATION> who pursued the lawsuit he had filed with his wife in 1983. `` I believe that it is a victory for her,'' <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON> said. `` It was n't 100 percent. I'm glad that we won partial, but it's a start.'' The jurors in the four-month trial would not discuss the verdict other than to say the process was `` emotional'' and `` nerve wracking.'' Anti-smoking groups viewed the verdict as a first step. It `` destroys the myth of invulnerability'' and should lead to an increase in such lawsuits, said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Daynard </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Northeastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> law professor who runs the <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liability </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Project </ORGANIZATION>, a support group for litigation against tobacco companies. `` What it's going to do is encourage hundreds of smokers and their families to seek redress. It has finally convinced lots of smokers that the evidence is clear,'' he said. To support the contention that <ORGANIZATION> Liggett </ORGANIZATION> violated its promise to consumers of a safe product, <PERSON> Edell </PERSON> introduced advertisements for <ORGANIZATION> Liggett </ORGANIZATION>'s cigarettes from the 1950s. One featured actress <PERSON> Rosalind </PERSON> <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> with the text reading: `` <PERSON> Rosalind </PERSON> <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> says L & amp; M Filters are Just What the Doctor Ordered!'' Others said: `` Nose, Throat and Accessory Organs Not Adversely Affected By Smoking Chesterfields,'' and `` Play Safe, Smoke Chesterfields.'' <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON>'s attorneys also introduced numerous secret corporate documents they said chronicled the inner workings of the industry. For many anti-smoking forces, disclosure of these documents into evidence was a victory. The documents spoke of a `` gentleman's agreement'' not to do cancer research, of an industry `` strategy'' to create `` doubt about the health charge without actually denying it'' and of a research program designed `` so that -LRB- the -RRB- results can not harm'' the industry. The companies denied the statements in the documents, saying they represented the views of individuals and were taken out of context. They contended that Mrs. <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON> knew the risks but chose to smoke anyway. They also argued that smoking is not a proven cause of cancer, and that her type of cancer has n't been linked to cigarettes. The defense managed to block many of <PERSON> Cipollone </PERSON>'s claims, including contentions that cigarette companies could be blamed for illnesses in smokers unaware of the dangers after the 1966 warnings, that the risk of cigarettes outweighed their usefulness and that the companies knew or should have known of a safer way to make cigarettes.

<HEAD>Contractor Mailing Concrete Blocks 700 Miles Via Postal Loophole</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANCHORAGE, Alaska (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION> building-materials supplier is taking advantage of a loophole in postal regulations to mail 6,000 concrete blocks to a remote village 700 miles away. The shipments across <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> could end up costing the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Postal Service $ 500,000, and even the air carrier that stands to profit thinks the mail system is being abused. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Krogstad </PERSON> of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> Consolidators, which specializes in sending construction materials via the mail, says the <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>'s losses are partly self-inflicted because the postal system pays 10 times as much to send the building materials by air freight as it charges <PERSON> Krogstad </PERSON> to mail them Each individually addressed concrete block costs <PERSON> Krogstad </PERSON> $ 4.33 in postage. The same block costs the post office $ 50.94 to deliver to <PERSON> Wainwright </PERSON>, an <LOCATION> Arctic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Eskimo </LOCATION> community about 90 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Barrow </LOCATION>. That's a subsidy of $ 46.61 per block. <PERSON> Krogstad </PERSON> also is mailing 4,600 bags of cement to <PERSON> Wainwright </PERSON>. The blocks each weigh 67 pounds and the bags of cement about 65 pounds, so they fall just under the parcel-post limit of 70 pounds to qualify as mail. His postage costs will total about $ 45,000. The blocks and bags could have been shipped via air freight from <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION> for a little more than $ 210,000, but the way mail is handled in rural <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> more than doubles the cost. First, the Postal Service trucks the blocks to <LOCATION> Fairbanks </LOCATION>, about 360 miles. They are then flown to <LOCATION> Barrow </LOCATION> on large cargo planes, transferred to small planes and flown to <PERSON> Wainwright </PERSON> in loads of 18 to 35 blocks. The practice is called `` bypass'' mail because the shipment moves directly from sender to airline to addressee, bypassing post offices. `` This was not the intent of the bypass program,'' says <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Dorgan </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> transportation supervisor. `` The original intent of bypass mail was to clear the postal floor of large shipments of groceries and staples required for day-to-day living.'' But <PERSON> Krogstad </PERSON> says the system means his shipments cost the <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> 76 cents a pound from Fairbanks to <PERSON> Wainwright </PERSON> instead of the 30 cents a pound that a charter flight from <LOCATION> Anchorage </LOCATION> to <PERSON> Wainwright </PERSON> would cost. `` It's ridiculous,'' <PERSON> Krogstad </PERSON> said. `` It's un-American, it's got to be unconstitutional, that a branch of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government ca n't go out and competitively bid to get the best price on hauling the mail. Even one of the prime beneficiaries of the block-lift has misgivings. `` We're philosophically opposed to it,'' says <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Brugman </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Northern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cargo </ORGANIZATION>, which is hauling many of the blocks and cement bags. `` It's not what the mail is for.'' <PERSON> Dorgan </PERSON> says he's worried the block-lift may put an end to bypass mail once word gets around. `` The people in the <PERSON> bush </PERSON> are the ones who are going to suffer,'' he said. Another problem, says <PERSON> Dorgan </PERSON>, is that the block-lift may cause a backup of ordinary mail, such as groceries, bound for villages served from <LOCATION> Barrow </LOCATION>. The idea of mailing the materials `` was an angle that got us the job,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilman </PERSON>, owner of <ORGANIZATION> Gilco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Construction </ORGANIZATION>, a contractor building a small-boat harbor at <PERSON> Wainwright </PERSON> with the blocks. He says he feels bad, but `` it is just an angle and that's the nature of the business we're in.''

 Former presidential candidate <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Babbitt </PERSON> said Democratic presidential nominee-apparent <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> should nominate a `` generic Southerner'' as his running mate.

 Alas!'

 A landmark welfare bill aimed at using education, jobs and training to help people break out of poverty is undergoing final adjustments as senators try to avert a presidential veto of the $ 2.6 billion, five-year measure. The Family Security Act sponsored by Sen. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Moynihan </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, reached the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor Monday after 18 months in the making. The painstaking groundwork produced a bipartisan bill co-sponsored by nearly two-thirds of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. `` This bill is not far off from what I find most people want,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Packwood </PERSON>, R-Ore., Republican floor manager of the measure `` This is as good an effort as we're likely to get out of this Congress.'' A more expensive <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> measure passed Dec. 17. Under the <PERSON> Moynihan </PERSON> bill, states would be required to set up education, training and work programs and include as many participants as they could afford. Besides putting more welfare recipients to work, the bill would force more absentee parents to pay child support and require states to provide at least six months of annual welfare benefits to poor households with two parents. Government checks would be a last resort, an income supplement reserved for when parents could not contribute an adequate amount in child support or earned wages. The bill would reverse the current system, under which the check is the central and usually only element. `` Never has the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> considered so fundamental a redirection of the -LRB- welfare -RRB- system,'' <PERSON> Moynihan </PERSON> said. Key senators and their staffs started meeting Monday with administration aides to discuss <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> demands for several new provisions. A presidential veto was threatened if administration demands were not met. The administration wants the bill to give states broader authority to use federal money for experimental welfare schemes; to require that a certain percentage of welfare recipients participate in jobs programs; and to set up a new mandatory workfare program that <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Minority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, R-Kan., said could cost as much as $ 900 million Aid to Families with Dependent Children, the current welfare system, was begun in 1935 to help widows with children to raise. The joint federal-state program now serves 3.7 families, including 7 million children, and the recipients are no longer widows _ they are for the most part single or divorced mothers. The nation is `` trying to make do with a <PERSON> Rube </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON> welfare system developed during the Depression to meet the needs of a society that no longer exists,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. `` Let's not lose this opportunity to move our country forward.'' Among the provisions in the <PERSON> Moynihan </PERSON> bill: _ States would have to require parents to furnish Social Security numbers at the birth of their children; meet minimum standards for establishing paternity; set guidelines for child support awards; and set procedures for immediate wage withholding from paychecks _ States would have to establish a jobs, education and training program for welfare recipients with children age 3 or over, or age 1 at state option; guarantee child care for participants, and spend half their money on people who are long-term welfare recipients or are likely to be _ States would have to provide nine months of transitional child care assistance and a year of Medicaid coverage for people moving off welfare into the workforce _ States would have to give welfare benefits to families with two parents in the home Twenty-six states already provide such benefits; <PERSON> Moynihan </PERSON>'s compromise would make six months a year mandatory in the other 24 states. _ The federal share of the new expenses, $ 2.6 billion over five years, would be financed primarily by making permanent the tax refund withholding program for delinquent federal debtors and phasing out the dependent care tax credit for higher-income taxpayers

He said foreigners would be scared to visit <PERSON> Sabah </PERSON> if the show were screened. <ORGANIZATION> Bernama </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Tanakinjal </PERSON>, <PERSON> Tenom </PERSON> assistant district officer, as saying he saw the television crew on May 27 coax a Murut to crawl to a jar of rice wine, take a sip and howl and bark like a dog. <PERSON> Tanakinjal </PERSON> said the crew ignored his protests and chased him away. <LOCATION> Tenom </LOCATION> district is 1,090 miles east of the capital, <LOCATION> Kuala </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lumpur </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Kadoh </PERSON> told a news conference in <LOCATION> Kota </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kinabalu </LOCATION>, capital of <LOCATION> Sabah </LOCATION> state, that he had ordered his ministry to investigate the incident.

 <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> <PERSON> Awad </PERSON>, an Arab-American advocate of non-violent resistance to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, arrived here after <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> defied the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and deported him from his birthplace of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. The deportation ended a seven-month legal battle and made <PERSON> Awad </PERSON> the 21st Arab to be expelled by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> since the Dec. 8 start of the Palestinian uprising in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Awad </PERSON>, 44, did not meet waiting reporters at <LOCATION> Kennedy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> after his arrival Monday night from <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. But a spokesman made a brief statement on his behalf and said <PERSON> Awad </PERSON> planned to a hold a news conference this afternoon. `` He wanted me to express his deep appreciation'' to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials who protested his deportation, said <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Kimball </PERSON>, director of the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> office of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Churches </ORGANIZATION>.

Ambassador to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickering </PERSON> and counsuls general in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> <PERSON> Draper </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilcox </PERSON>. `` They have worked consistently, arduously and enormously helpfully on his behalf from the beginning of this whole process, and he's deeply grateful,'' <PERSON> Kimball </PERSON> said, his words at times drowned out by the chanting of anti-Awad protesters. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> condemned <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s order that <PERSON> Awad </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizen, be deported. <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> alleged that <PERSON> Awad </PERSON> played a key role in the Arab uprising in the occupied territories. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said Monday, `` We think it is unjustifiable to deny Mr. <PERSON> Awad </PERSON> the right to stay and live in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> where he was born. If he acted illegally, he should have been charged and tried in court with full due process of law.'' <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has regularly carried out deportations to quell unrest or subdue Palestinian nationalist activity, notably expelling nine <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> mayors between 1980 and 1982. But the number of deportations has greatly increased since the Arab uprising began. Awad, whom supporters call the `` <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gandhi </LOCATION>,'' denied inciting violence against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> but has supported the uprising in the territories <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> captured in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. Although he has little influence in the Palestinian community, some tactics he advocates, such as tax boycotts and commercial strikes, were adopted by leaders of the uprising. <PERSON> Awad </PERSON>, who was incarcerated 40 days in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, was kept away from reporters in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> before he left, but his letters to supporters from prison were distributed. `` Even after my departure, my efforts will continue,'' <PERSON> Awad </PERSON> wrote. `` We have no choice but to continue with the uprising for our liberation.'' He vowed in the letters to return soon. <PERSON> Awad </PERSON>, a Christian, has said he might convert to <ORGANIZATION> Judaism </ORGANIZATION> as a means to return to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. His deportation was protested by about a dozen Israelis at the <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> airport and 25 supporters in downtown <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. Dozens of angry Israelis staged an impromptu counterdemonstration, calling the Awad supporters traitors. Awad was deported on the grounds that his three-month tourist visa, issued when he entered <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> last August, had expired. The Israelis refused to extend the visa, and the <ORGANIZATION> Israeli </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> last week rejected <PERSON> Awad </PERSON>'s appeal to remain. Some 50 demonstrators _ about evenly split for and against <PERSON> Awad </PERSON> _ gathered at <LOCATION> Kennedy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> State Assemblyman <PERSON> Dov </PERSON> <PERSON> Hikind </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> Democrat, led a group of protesters who shouted `` Awad is a terrorist.'' Separated from the <PERSON> Hikind </PERSON> group by a line of police officers was a pro-Arab group shouting `` Down, down with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'' and `` Long live <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Awad </PERSON>, who lived in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for 13 years before returning to <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> in 1983, is the founder of the Palestinian Center for the Study of Non-Violence.

The joint Najib-Gorbachev statement distributed over the official <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency said: `` The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> believed that the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Mission monitoring compliance with the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> accords would adopt ... effective measures to curb the practice -LRB- of <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> aiding the guerrillas -RRB- which, if continued, would make it necessary to undertake the most resolute retaliatory steps.'' In recent days, the Soviets have been warning <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> that continuing to arm the guerrillas violated the accords signed in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> in April. Under the accords, the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> agreed to withdraw its more than 100,000 troops from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> by Feb. 15, and the withdrawal began May 15.

Thousands of Soviet troops have already pulled out, but <PERSON> Cordovez </PERSON> refused to say exactly how many. However, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> ambassador, <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shah </PERSON> <PERSON> Nawaz </PERSON>, said Monday that `` the world will not be surprised if a crumbling -LRB- Afghan -RRB- regime makes a desperate bid to retain the protective umbrella of foreign troops.''

 <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> says he can rally his supporters behind certain <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> even if he's not <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' running mate, if the two can agree on key policy issues. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said it was premature to discuss whether he will actively seek the vice presidential spot on the Democratic national ticket. But by virtue of his performance in the primaries, `` we've earned the right for serious consideration, and if there is a criteria by which one qualifies for consideration we'll pass it,'' said <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, speaking to reporters on Monday Even if his name is n't on the ticket, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said he could deliver his supporters for the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor, `` so long as our agreements are rational, fair and consistent.'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said negotiations with the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> camp so far `` are having an impact on broadening and strengthening the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>.'' He praised a weekend agreement with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> backers to brand <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> a `` terrorist state'' as part of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> platform. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> made his remarks a day after representatives of both <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> presidential candidates held the first in a series of platform-drafting meetings at <LOCATION> Mackinac </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich </LOCATION>. The representatives announced they had agreed on the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> issue. This `` is a step in the right direction for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> because we must regain our credibility and our moral authority in the third world as leader of the free world,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> told reporters at the impromptu sidewalk news conference. But <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said differences over other issues remain. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, for instance, is calling for a freeze on military spending, which <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has n't supported. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said a freeze would give us `` money to pay for our dreams,'' including health care, housing and senior citizens' programs. Meanwhile, in an interview published today, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> called <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> the nation's most racially divided city. The racial tensions in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> are `` not representative of what's happening in American today,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION>. `` I ca n't think of another city in the country right now where you have the kind of confrontation without shame along racial lines that you now have in our City Council-type squabbles,'' he said. `` That's not <LOCATION> L.A. </LOCATION>, that's not <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, that's not any other major city I know, and it's really beneath the dignity of the city,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said in a meeting with the editorial board of the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> for meetings with his national staff to discuss plans for next month's Democratic National Convention.

<HEAD>Students Call For Korean Unification Near Border</HEAD>

<DATELINE>IMJINGAK, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Hundreds of radical students chanting anti-American slogans demonstrated today at the edge of the demilitarized zone for reunification of <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. About 1,300 students staged a sitdown protest in front of a bridge leading to the zone that divides the <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> peninsula. The bridge was blocked by steel barriers and rolls of barbed wire. `` Drive out <ORGANIZATION> Yankees </ORGANIZATION> who hinder unification'' and `` Advance unification,'' students chanted. The students denounced the government of President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> Tae-woo and yelled slogans calling on all South Korean students to refuse compulsory weekly military training. The training is required for all male students. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> troops that normally guard the bridge were withdrawn before the students arrived today. A few South Korean personnel were seen guarding the bridge on the other side of the barriers. The students, from <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Joongang </ORGANIZATION> universities in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, went to <LOCATION> Imjingak </LOCATION> in a convoy of buses for a prayer ceremony for reunification. They were accompanied by professors from the two schools to help ensure the demonstration was peaceful. <LOCATION> Imjingak </LOCATION>, the last civilian area on the main road from <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, is about three miles from the southern edge of the demilitarized zone. The government banned a march Friday to the border with communist North Korean by thousands of radical students seeking talks with North Korean student delegates on reunification. Fierce street clashes erupted in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> when riot police blocked radicals going to the border, and about 900 students were arrested. Student leaders said today's demonstration, described as a prayer ceremony for unification, was different from Friday's march since there were no plans to enter the demilitarized zone or meet with North Korean representatives. The South Korean government says it alone can have contacts with the north. The 2 -LCB- - mile-wide zone separates the two Koreas with the border running through the center Forces of the two sides control their respective sides of the zone. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops help control the south's side of the zone across from <LOCATION> Imjingak </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Panmunjom </LOCATION> truce site that straddles the border. Students wanted to meet Friday at <LOCATION> Panmunjom </LOCATION> with <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> student delegates who reportedly were waiting there. Radical students have been demanding reunification of the <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> peninsula </LOCATION>, divided since 1945 when <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet troops ended the Japanese occupation at the end of World War II. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> has been hit by a wave of violent anti-government and anti-American protests during the past month. Radical students battled riot police to press for overthrow of the <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> government and reunification. The radicals, a small but powerful minority among South Korean students, claim the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> enforces partition of the peninsula to rule the south. Radicals demand withdrawal of the 42,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops based in the south under a defense treaty. The radicals have been unable to attract public support. Most South Koreans fear the north is determined to conquer the peninsula. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> invaded the south in 1950 to start the Korean War.

<HEAD>U.S. Appeals Court Says Illegal Alien Entitled To Sue For Back Pay</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A federal appeals court decision that an illegal alien can sue his employer for nearly $ 50,000 in unpaid wages `` blazes a trail'' for other rulings favoring immigrant workers, a union official says. The Atlanta-based 11th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> ruled that <PERSON> Rajni </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Patel </PERSON>, an illegal alien from <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, is entitled to sue for unpaid back wages incurred during a three-year period. The decision reverses a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling last year throwing out the case, which hinged on the court's interpretation of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Fair Labor Standards Act. The <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ladies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Garment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> supplied <PERSON> Patel </PERSON> with legal help and filed a brief supporting him. Union spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Burke </PERSON> said the ruling not only vindicates <PERSON> Patel </PERSON>'s claims, but `` blazes a trail which, we hope, will lead to similar rulings on other fronts ... favorable to immigrants.'' The appeals court cleared the way for <PERSON> Patel </PERSON> to proceed with his lawsuit against a <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, hotel, where he worked as a maintenance man and janitor from 1982 to 1985. <PERSON> Patel </PERSON> in 1986 sued the Quality Inn South of <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION> and its owners, <ORGANIZATION> Sumani </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, contending that the hotel violated wage and overtime laws and owed him $ 47,132 in back pay, plus damages and attorneys' fees. In March 1987, according to the appeals court opinion, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Acker </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> suggested to the hotel's lawyers that they request a summary judgment to the effect that <PERSON> Patel </PERSON>, as an undocumented alien, was n't entitled to the protection of the Fair Labor Standards Act The hotel's attorneys, `` able to take a hint,'' made such a request, the 11th Circuit noted, and the judgment was issued against <PERSON> Patel </PERSON> in May 1987. He appealed. A three-judge panel of the 11th <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, in an opinion released last week, noted that the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> has historically `` adopted an expansive definition of the term ` employee,''' and that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has clearly intended for undocumented aliens to be protected under the fair labor law. <PERSON> Patel </PERSON>'s case, the 11th <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> said, falls under the law, and `` nothing in the act purports to limit the remedy available to ... workers.'' `` <PERSON> Patel </PERSON> is not attempting to recover back pay for being unlawfully deprived of a job,'' the appeals court wrote. `` Rather, he simply seeks to recover unpaid minimum wages and overtime for work already performed.''

<HEAD>Eskimo Reunion Highlights Siberian Visit</HEAD>

<DATELINE>PROVIDENIYA, U.S.S.R. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Alaskan and Soviet Eskimos holding their first major reunion since the Cold War imposed a forced separation 40 years ago sang and talked animatedly today about current events _ like walrus hunting. The meeting at the Palace of Culture in this remote Siberian port was one of the highlights of the 225-mile `` friendship flight'' from the western <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Nome </LOCATION> by an 82-member <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> delegation. <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Gologergen </PERSON>, 68, of <LOCATION> Nome </LOCATION> shared a traditional song with a Siberian Eskimo who identified himself as <PERSON> Kaygigun </PERSON>, 41, from the nearby village of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chaplino </LOCATION>. `` They got three walruses last night,'' <PERSON> Gologergen </PERSON> said later. `` They were hauling them back and forth by dog team, and he heard that we were coming. He dropped everything and came over. `` He said this way is really good _ just to speak our own -LRB- Yupik -RRB- dialect and not listen to the war stories or think about war, or plan about war _ just be doing our thing, speaking our Yupik language and hunting and being relaxed,'' <PERSON> Gologergen </PERSON> said. The Soviets earlier this month approved the charter flight by <ORGANIZATION> Eskimos </ORGANIZATION>, Alaskan business leaders, peace activists and politicians, the product of two years' work by Alaskans. Eskimos once freely crossed the icy <LOCATION> Bering </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strait </LOCATION> in motorboats and walrus-skin umiaks to trade and visit with relatives. The Cold War ended all that in 1948, when the border was closed. Summit meetings between President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> helped make the `` friendship flight'' possible, said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Clarke </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> official on the flight. The summits were `` strong on people-to-people exchanges,'' <PERSON> Clarke </PERSON> said. `` This is a real grass-roots effort.'' The leader of the effort was <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Stimpfle </PERSON>, a 40-year-old <LOCATION> Nome </LOCATION> real estate agent who dreamed up the flight two years ago to help thaw relations between <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Stimpfle </PERSON> said he wrote hundreds of letters to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet officials, trying to win acceptance for his idea of breaking down political barriers with good will. `` There's security in friendship,'' he said. While eastern <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION> is eight time zones away from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, it's only 3 miles from <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> at the closest point <LOCATION> Provideniya </LOCATION>, with about 5,000 residents, is a gray city of concrete-block apartments surrounded by mountains. Remnants of the winter's packed ice still clog the fringes of the harbor. Like Nome, an old gold-rush town of 3,700, <LOCATION> Provideniya </LOCATION> has no roads leading inland. As the <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737 came to a halt on the gravel Siberian runway, schoolchildren waved Soviet and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> flags. Local officials and visitors shouted greetings in Russian, English and Yupik over the roar of jets. Leaders of the Alaskan delegation were handed carnations beneath a sign proclaiming `` Peace and Friendship Between <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Chukotka </LOCATION>!'' <LOCATION> Provideniya </LOCATION> is in the district of <LOCATION> Chokotka </LOCATION>. Formality soon gave way to a frenzy of hugs, handshakes and trading of pins, flags, chewing gum and postcards. The reunion came too late for <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Waghiyi </PERSON>, 64, an Eskimo born on <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lawrence </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, 40 miles from the Siberian coast, who came looking for a distant relative on his father's side, but learned the man had died years ago. <PERSON> Waghiyi </PERSON> remembered visiting the relative as a young man. `` The next year, I was going to see him at <LOCATION> Gambell </LOCATION> -LRB- on <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lawrence </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> -RRB-. He was going to give me a <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> coat, but they closed the Russian border.'' Other potential reunions were aborted when a planned trip to a nearby native village was canceled by poor weather. Still, <PERSON> Waghiyi </PERSON> and others hoped the visit would clear the way for more interchanges between <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gologergen </PERSON> said that, governments willing, the Siberian Eskimos would visit <LOCATION> Alaska </LOCATION>. `` We were like East and <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> before,'' said <PERSON> Waghiyi </PERSON>. `` We were like behind the Iron Curtain. Now we're going to be in their front yard.''

<HEAD>Former Justice Minister Dies at 69.</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Lucien </PERSON> <PERSON> Cardin </PERSON>, who precipitated a parliamentary crisis in 1966 as justice minister in the Liberal government of Prime Minister <PERSON> Lester </PERSON> <PERSON> Pearson </PERSON>, died at his home after a long battle with cancer. He was 69. <PERSON> Cardin </PERSON>, who died Monday, had been a judge of the <ORGANIZATION> Tax </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canada </ORGANIZATION> since 1983. First elected to <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> as <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> member from <LOCATION> Quebec </LOCATION> in 1952, <PERSON> Cardin </PERSON> was re-elected six times before deciding not to run in the 1968 general election. After the Liberals under <PERSON> Pearson </PERSON> formed a government in 1963, <PERSON> Cardin </PERSON> was appointed associate defense minister, then public works minister, and finally justice minister. His troubles as justice minister began in 1965 when he confirmed on television that <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Vancouver </LOCATION> postal clerk, had been spying for the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON> had admitted to spying and was fired by the post office without a pension. He was n't prosecuted because he was dying of cancer. The opposition in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> contended that <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON> should n't have been fired without being prosecuted <PERSON> Cardin </PERSON> defended the government's position. To save his government, <PERSON> Pearson </PERSON> had to agree to an opposition demand for an investigation into the loss of <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON>'s pension. The scandal grew when <PERSON> Cardin </PERSON>, under opposition attack for the Liberals' handling of security cases, replied on March 4, 1966, that the opposition had no business talking. <PERSON> Cardin </PERSON> then mentioned an embarrassing case involving the Conservatives. <PERSON> Pearson </PERSON> had asked the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canadian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mounted </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> in 1964 for all files on members of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> in which security was involved. As a result, he had been briefed on <PERSON> Gerda </PERSON> <PERSON> Munsinger </PERSON>, a German call-girl and suspected Soviet agent who was considered a security problem because of an affair with <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Sevigny </PERSON>. At the time, <PERSON> Sevigny </PERSON> was associate defense minister in the Conservative government of Prime Minister <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Diefenbaker </PERSON>. <PERSON> Pearson </PERSON> had discussed the <PERSON> Munsinger </PERSON> affair privately with <PERSON> Diefenbaker </PERSON>, but <PERSON> Cardin </PERSON>'s blurted reference in <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> was the first public disclosure. <PERSON> Pearson </PERSON> appointed a justice of <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> to look into the matter, which aroused concern in the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Cardin </PERSON> resigned as justice minister in 1967.

<TEXT>
 Battling Southern Baptists headed toward a showdown decision that would either curb rule of their 14.6-million member denomination by fundamentalists, or perpetuate it for the next generation. More than at any time since the fundamentalist tide began rolling nine years ago, moderates seemed to feel they had an even chance of breaking it at this year's convention, which meets today. `` They have a chance because they have a good candidate,'' said <PERSON> Toby </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Druin </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, assistant editor of the weekly <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION>, referring to the prospective moderate nominee for the denominational presidency. The Rev. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, the moderate from <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, is expected to be pitted against fundamentalist candidate <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Vines </PERSON>, a minister from <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla </LOCATION>. The nominations and voting for president of the denomination, the nation's largest Protestant body, come this afternoon. `` It's going to be neck and neck,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> McClellan </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, retired long-time denominational executive. Through successive presidencies, whose appointments gradually determine ruling trustees of the denomination's far-flung operational network, fundamentalists nearly have completed their takeover. Their timetable says one more year would seal the process. But moderates see signs that many who have supported fundamentalists before think they have gone to excess in newly restrictive measures on institutions and agencies, driving out some widely respected personnel. Indications also have arisen of links between fundamentalist strategists and the religious right on social-political issues. That gives the conflict a broad political tinge rather than it being an intramural difference over Bible interpretation, as it often has been pictured. `` People are becoming alarmed,'' <PERSON> McClellan </PERSON> said. `` There's a definite swing against these extremes.'' However, some peculiar back-stage maneuvering has gone on that possibly could scuttle the expected contest between <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> and Vines. The Rev. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bisagno </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> suggested that to dampen the head-on conflict, only one of the two be nominated as a consensus candidate this year, the other two years hence. That seemed unlikely, but the possibility was discussed that <PERSON> Bisagno </PERSON> himself might be nominated, which probably would reduce chances of the moderate-backed <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. A hint of fundamentalist strength also came in a preconvention pastors conference Monday afternoon when a fundamentalist, the Rev. <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION>, was elected president. He defeated a moderate, the Rev. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> of <PERSON> Tyler </PERSON>. The presidency of the pastor's conference has been a stepping stone to the convention presidency for the last decade. Among the fundamentalist engineered steps that have intensified controversy during the last year: _ Endorsement of Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bork </PERSON> for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, contrary to long-time denominational policy against siding for or against specific candidates. The conservative <PERSON> Bork </PERSON> later withdrew from the nomination. _ Adopting mission board policies against women clergy and divorced ministers in most cases, and instituting screening of personnel to assure that they took a literalist view of the Bible. _ Moves that drove from office the Rev. <PERSON> Randall </PERSON> <PERSON> Lolley </PERSON> as president of <ORGANIZATION> Southeastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Theological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seminary </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Wake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Forest </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, and the Rev. <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> as head of the denomination's ethics agency, the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. _ Ouster of the Rev. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheridan </PERSON> as head of a regional <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jersey </ORGANIZATION> interfaith unit because he contended that God's covenant with Jews remained valid. _ Pushing right-wing causes for capital punishment, prayer in public schools, aid to religious schools, and against all abortions except to save the mother's life.

 A <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling on vaccine liability focused on the only common vaccine that can cause the disease it is intended to prevent, experts say. The court ruled Monday that the federal government may be forced to pay damages for polio resulting from the oral vaccine for that disease. But in general, side effects from vaccines are rare, and `` it's far better to be vaccinated than to get the disease,'' said <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Giebink </PERSON>, professor of pediatrics at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> Here are common vaccines and their side effects: _ Oral polio vaccine, which is given twice in the first year of life with boosters in the second year and just before entering school. It has no side effects other than rare cases of polio paralysis, which occurs in about one out of every 3.2 million doses of vaccine, <PERSON> Giebink </PERSON> said. The paralytic reaction is most common in people with hampered immune systems, either the vaccinated child or a family member of a vaccinated child, he said. The weakened virus used in the vaccine can pass to a family member, possibly causing trouble if that person's immune system is weakened, he said. _ Diphtheria-Tetanus-Pertussis vaccine, given at ages two months, four months, six months, 15 months and at entry to school. Pertussis is whooping cough. About one in 110,000 children who get the DTP vaccine develop a brain dysfunction that can include seizures. It is usually temporary. But about one in 310,000 vaccinated children get permanent damage that includes mental retardation or movement difficulties, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION>. Whether those problems are caused by the vaccine is controversial, said <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Katz </PERSON>, chairman of the pediatrics department at the <ORGANIZATION> Duke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Giebink </PERSON> said they appear to be linked to the vaccine because its more mild side effects may lead to a doctor's examination, which uncovers the serious problem that may gone unnoticed before the inoculation. The mild side effects include muscle soreness and swelling at the injection site, which occur in about half the injections, and fever, in about one-fifth of immunizations, he said. About one in 2,000 children develops a fever and convulsions, without lasting effects, he said. _ Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine, given at age 18 months. The disease being prevented is a potentially fatal infection that can cause brain damage, pneumonia and other effects. The vaccine has no serious side effects, <PERSON> Giebink </PERSON> said. Fewer than 1 percent of recipients get a fever, and one in five have arm soreness or tenderness. _ Measles-Mumps-Rubella vaccine, given at age 15 months. No serious side effects are known, although in very rare cases a spell of fever and convulsions can follow the shot, <PERSON> Giebink </PERSON> said. Some children get a rash or slight fever lasting a few days. About one in seven have a mild swelling of lymph glands in the neck. About one in 50 teen-age or adult women experience a short-lived aching or swelling of joints, he said. _ Influenza vaccine, given mostly to people in high-risk groups, such as those with chronic lung or heart disease, and the elderly. Despite publicity about a paralysis called Guillain-Barre syndrome associated with swine flu vaccines in 1976, flu vaccines in general cause no serious side effects, <PERSON> Giebink </PERSON> and <PERSON> Katz </PERSON> said.

 Delicate threads are linking the affluent suburbs of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and the poverty-ridden slums of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, in a project started by an Indian social worker. <PERSON> Pushpika </PERSON> <PERSON> Freitas </PERSON>, 31, describes her plan to market the clothing and other handiwork of her native land as `` capitalism with a conscience.'' `` What we're doing is not only selling products and helping people in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, but also educating some of the people here about the different conditions there,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Freitas </PERSON> in a recent interview. `` There's the whole aspect of brotherhood and sisterhood, identifying with people on the other side of world who live in very bad conditions but would really want to change their lives or improve themselves.'' Ms. <PERSON> Freitas </PERSON>, who divides her time between <LOCATION> Bombay </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, founded the non-profit group called `` MarketPlace: Handwork of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'' in 1986, to provide a marketing outlet in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for the handmade crafts and clothing items. Since then, the volunteer agency has promoted the sale of about $ 20,000 worth of goods in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, mostly through homes and churches in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s northern suburbs. Its first major experiment with a retail shop came this year through Nomad's, an import handcraft store in suburban <LOCATION> Evanston </LOCATION>. More than $ 2,500 worth of the brightly colored patchwork and intricately embroidered cotton clothing, bags and table mats has been sold since the items went on display May 14. `` It's gone very well ... and we intend to continue what has been a good relationship,'' said <PERSON> Catharine </PERSON> <PERSON> Cole </PERSON>, Nomad's owner. About 45 percent to 50 percent of the money from the sales goes back to the Indian cooperatives that make the items. The rest covers shipping fees, duties and promotional and office expenses. Ms. <PERSON> Freitas </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> women who work as domestic servants earn only about $ 15 to $ 20 a month for working 8 to 10 hours a day, 7 days a week. Through the cooperatives, she said, they can double their earnings while working at home. Ms. <PERSON> Freitas </PERSON> has been involved with the cooperatives since she returned to her native <LOCATION> Bombay </LOCATION> in 1979 after receiving her master's degree in sociology from <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> University </PERSON>, where her husband is a political science professor She found women in <LOCATION> Bombay </LOCATION> to be `` the poorest of the poor, unskilled and uneducated.'' But she also found them motived to keep their families going. `` Being a woman, I empathized with their situation and wanted to do something about this,'' she said. So in 1980, Ms. <PERSON> Freitas </PERSON> founded a patchwork cooperative with three women in <LOCATION> Bombay </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Golibar </LOCATION> slum district who made quilts, cushion covers and garments. Now, the patchwork center provides work for 35 women who pick up materials and instructions and work at home on a piece-work basis. There also are three other workshops employing 30 poor women and handicapped men. Those workshops are a sewing shop, a hand-block fabric printing shop and a silk screen shop, where workers are trained to make stationery and ornamental paper. In 1985, Ms. <PERSON> Freitas </PERSON> helped launch a non-profit coalition of cottage industries called SHARE, or Support the Handicapped Rehabilitation Effort. It now works with about 25 cooperatives around <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, helping them with professional advice on sales and marketing. `` All these things are important, otherwise these programs are like charity under a different name,'' Ms. <PERSON> Freitas </PERSON> said. `` It's teaching a man to fish rather than providing the fish. The cooperatives produce goods like flowing caftain dresses, needlepoint belts, embroidered blouses and stationery sets for export. Many shirts and skirts go for $ 16, and the most expensive items are huge quilts that cost $ 200 to $ 250. Ms. <PERSON> Freitas </PERSON> plans to introduce a mail order catalog by next year. She acknowledges that it's been hard to interest major retailers who are looking for bulk orders and uniform designs, but she believes in her project. `` I am convinced that the products can really take off here in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> ... and make some significant changes ... in <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>,'' she said.

 <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> this week will launch its biggest, most versatile rocket ever, which could give it an edge over the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and other countries in the race to commercialize space. Ariane-4, which is to blast off Wednesday from the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>'s space center in <LOCATION> Kourou </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Guiana </LOCATION>, was declared ready for service on Saturday. Fueling of the rocket began Sunday. The new generation rocket is designed to serve as <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s `` workhorse on the world launch services market until the end of this century,'' according to officials at <ORGANIZATION> Arianespace </ORGANIZATION>, the commercial arm of the 13-nation <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> consortium The rocket will on its inaugural launch carry an international payload of three satellites into orbit, demonstrating the vehicle's space readiness to potential customers Capable of carrying heavier payloads than previous Arianes, the rocket is the most sophisticated the Europeans have ever produced. Its design allows engineers to strap on different configurations of solid and liquid boosters, tailoring the vehicle to a client's specific budget and needs, the agency said Developed over the past six years at a cost of $ 575 million, Ariane-4 can carry a maximum load of 4.6 tons into orbit. Ariane-3, the previous generation, had a maximum capacity of 2.8 tons. <ORGANIZATION> Arianespace </ORGANIZATION> already hauls half the world's commercial payloads. As of May 25, the company held 67 launch contracts worth $ 3.4 billion. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> have barely entered the race. But in the coming years, <ORGANIZATION> Arianespace </ORGANIZATION> faces competition from the American Titan-4 made by <ORGANIZATION> Martin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marietta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, Atlas-Centaur built by <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dynamics </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> made by <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> _ as well as from the Soviet <ORGANIZATION> Proton </ORGANIZATION>, the Chinese Long March and the Japanese H-2, now under development. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had been depending on its space shuttles as the chief launchers of commercial satellites until Jan. 28, 1986, when the shuttle Challenger exploded just after liftoff, killing all seven crew members. There has not been a shuttle launch since. The next one is expected late this summer. Even when the shuttles resume regular flights, their focus will be on military and scientific missions, rather than commercial operations. However, the Delta-2 will begin commercial flights this fall with the Titan-3 scheduled to begin early next year. The Atlas-Centaur is scheduled to take off with paying customers in the middle of 1989. Previously, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> rockets lifted mostly military and scientific loads under supervision of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> or the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Arianespace </ORGANIZATION> officials consider the Titan rocket their toughest competitor in the world market of about 25 launches a year. The Titan is the only <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> rocket able to haul satellites weighing more than 2.7 tons. The main <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> challenger may turn out to be the new Delta-2, which will be bigger and more powerful than the current model. <ORGANIZATION> Arianespace </ORGANIZATION> plans to build and launch 70 of their new rockets between now and 1995, when the Ariane-5 will be ready to fly. One of the three satellites due to be sent into space on Wednesday, the Meteostat-P2, will be placed in orbit to furnish weather data to 16 <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> countries. The 1,529-pound satellite will monitor weather over most of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> and the eastern half of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. It replaces Meteostat-F2, launched in 1981, which until recently sent back pictures of earth every half hour. The 330-pound Amsat-3C, known by the nickname Oscar-13, will serve the needs of amateur radio operators around the world. PAS-1, a satellite owned by the American telecommunications company <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Satellite </ORGANIZATION>, will further telecommunications service at a moderate cost between <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. It also will provide some <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> countries with the ability to create national television networks.

<TEXT>
 A drug used for 20 years to lower cholesterol and prevent blood clotting may help block AIDS infection, according to preliminary tests in a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government laboratory. The drug, called dextran sulfate, protected immune system cells from AIDS infection for more than two weeks in the laboratory, said <PERSON> Hiroaki </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitsuya </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>. He reported his findings Monday at the <ORGANIZATION> Fourth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> on AIDS. The first phase of human trials of the drug has just been completed at <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> <LOCATION> General </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, where doctors say it is too soon to know whether it will perform as well in patients as it does in the laboratory. `` For the most part, the drug was well tolerated'' by the experimental subjects, said Dr. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON>, director of the study. Some of the 30 patients who received varying doses of the drug for up to eight weeks showed signs of liver abnormalities, a lowering of white blood cell count and hyperexcitability _ but there were no major side effects, he said. The study was designed only to determine whether the drug was safe to give to AIDS patients, <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> said. It is not approved for use in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, but it has been used in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and elsewhere as an anti-coagulant and cholesterol-lowering agent, <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> said. The researchers did notice, however, that the drug produced slight elevation in the number of T4 cells in the subjects, <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> said. These cells are controllers of the body's immune system and they are a principal target of the AIDS virus, which kills them. Many AIDS victims are obtaining dextran sulfate through illicit channels and taking it on their own, which could be risky, <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> said. Many of these patients are also taking AZT, which can extend life. The problem is that AZT is broken down in the liver and dextran sulfate might disrupt liver function, <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> said, thus aggravating potentially serious side effects associated with AZT. <PERSON> Mitsuya </PERSON>, who works in the laboratory of Dr. <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Broder </PERSON>, one of the leaders in the search for anti-AIDS drugs, said the laboratory studies suggest dextran sulfate blocks the first step in AIDS infection _ the attachment of the AIDS virus to the outside of the T4 cells. Combinations of dextran sulfate and AZT suppress AIDS infection in the laboratory even better than either drug does alone, <PERSON> Mitsuya </PERSON> said. The virus of acquired immune deficiency syndrome attacks the body's immune system and leaves victims susceptible to a wide variety of infections and cancers. AIDS is most often transmitted through sexual contact. Other means of transmission include transfusions of tainted blood or blood products and the sharing of contaminated hypodermic needles or syringes by drug abusers. AIDS can also be passed from mother to child at or before birth.

 <PERSON> Marlise </PERSON> <PERSON> Ricardos </PERSON>, a drama major at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION>, was crowned Miss <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> in a finale marred when another contestant pulled out a banner saying `` Pageants Hurt All People.'' <PERSON> Michelle </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, 21, who represented <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruz </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, was pulled from the stage by security guards Monday night as she yelled that the winner had bruises all over her body because she suffered from a weight-loss illness, anorexia. The 26-year-old winner, who wore the banner of the city of <LOCATION> Lomita </LOCATION>, had little to say about the incident. `` There's nothing I can really say at this moment that would be in good taste so I'd rather not comment, but she and I do n't see eye to eye,'' said <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Ricardos </PERSON>. The 65th Miss <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> pageant was the third at the <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diego </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, where it was moved from <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruz </LOCATION> after protests with crowds up to 1,000 marred previous contests. Ten finalists chosen from a pool of 42 during preliminary contests over the weekend participated in the finals televised around the state. The judges rated the women on the basis of swimsuit and talent competition and interviews. Miss <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, who was n't one of the finalists, said she had planned all year to stage the protest. `` The whole point is that pageants hurt all women,'' Miss <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said outside the Civic Center. `` They hurt women who are on the inside because they are bruised psychologically and physically by what they must endure to become queens. `` Pageants hurt women on the outside because -LRB- the contestants -RRB- are an icon that we must all look up to and that we're all supposed to emulate, but that makes us unhealthy and promotes anorexia and bulimia and cosmetic surgery.'' Miss <PERSON> Ricardos </PERSON> will represent the state in the <LOCATION> Miss </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pageant </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> in September. She also won $ 20,000 in scholarships, wardrobe money and gifts. Miss Ricardos, first runner up the past two years, said she would use the money to further her college education and career. She sang `` I Dreamed a Dream'' during the talent competition. `` It's extremely exciting because I've been working on this for six years,'' Miss <PERSON> Ricardos </PERSON> said of the pageant. `` It's a wonderful way for women to pay for their education.'' In previous years, pageant protesters have focused on racism and sexism they say is promoted by the contest. But, with the contest itself 65-years-old, protesters said they decided to focus on age discrimination. `` We're here to celebrate women's diversity,'' said <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Simonton </PERSON>, a 35-year-old former model who led the protest by a <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruz-based </LOCATION> group, MediaWatch. Ms. <PERSON> Simonton </PERSON>, covergirl of the 1974 Sports Illustrated swimsuit edition who has been arrested several times during previous protests, wore a trash can with a banner that read, `` Mis-Erable.'' `` I feel older women are ignored to a large degree in our society and they're relegated to a trash can which is why I'm emphasizing it by being dressed this way,'' Ms. <PERSON> Simonton </PERSON> said Several dozen demonstrators wearing makeup, worn clothes and wigs carried signs saying, `` Slaves to Stereotypes,'' `` There's Life at 44, and `` Beauty Comes In All Types of Packages. About a dozen police officers monitored the protests. There were no arrests. Pageant organizers say the contest promotes the things for women that protesters want, better education and equality in the work place.

<HEAD>EEC To End Curbs on Capital Movements Starting in 1990</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PHILIPPE NEURAY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LUXEMBOURG (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 In a major step toward a unified European market, the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION>'s finance ministers agreed to remove all controls on capital flow within the Common Market starting in 1990. Monday's accord will let <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> citizens open bank accounts and obtain other financial services such as loans in any of the 12 Common Market member nations. <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> officials said this will spur more competition among banks and create a single financial market competitive in size with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. `` Creation of this large financial area ... should make it possible for -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> banks -RRB- to catch up with the financial centers in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Jacques </PERSON> <PERSON> Delors </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION>'s executive commission The accord figures in the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Internal Market'' plan under which all internal borders that still hamper a free flow of people, goods and services are to by removed by 1992. `` The freedom of capital flows is an important step toward creation of a European market and a monetary union,'' West German Finance Minister <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Stoltenberg </PERSON>, the meeting's chairman, told reporters. Removal of the money controls is to take effect in eight of the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION>'s most developed nations on July 1, 1990. <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> may retain their controls until the end of 1992 and <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> will be allowed to extend the transition period until 1995. Of the other eight, only <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION> still maintain strict controls on capital. The others already have fully liberalized their capital markets. The accord was reached despite last-minute concerns by <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION> that the measure would encourage tax evasion and fraud. Finance Minister <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON> <PERSON> Beregovoy </PERSON> of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> first sought to link the capital liberalization to a requirement the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> mandate equal tax levels throughout the trade bloc. This was firmly rejected by <PERSON> Nigel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s Chancellor of the Exchequer, who said it would force his country to levy unpopular sales taxes on food, children's clothing and other items. In the end, the ministers asked the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> to study the issue and make any tax equalization proposals by June 30, 1989. But a vote on these must be unanimous, effectively giving <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> a veto right while the accord to free capital flows would proceed on schedule regardless of the outcome. `` All in all, it was a useful day's work,'' <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> told reporters after the meeting. `` The liberalization of capital markets goes ahead on schedule.'' `` It's very happy news because if we had not managed to come to an agreement today, it would have put the creation of a unified internal market in the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> by 1992 in a very bad light,'' said an <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> official who spoke on condition of anonymity. The ministers also resolved objections by <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>, which feared the accord would interfere with very strict reporting of interest payments to the tax authorities. Officials said it was agreed that <PERSON> Danes </PERSON> with bank accounts elsewhere in the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> must continue to report the bank account to <LOCATION> Danish </LOCATION> authorities and promise to let the bank provide all requested information to the tax authorities. The ministers also resolved a variety of other concerns of <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, which have highly protected banking sectors and which expressed fears of massive capital outflows in a free market. Under the accord, countries may impose temporary capital curbs for up to six months, in periods of stress without prior approval from the <ORGANIZATION> EEC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>. After that six-month period, the controls must be reviewed and approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> The ministers also provided for a fund of $ 19.2 billion to help central banks cope with any imbalances in capital flows resulting from the new legislation. The accord must now be approved by the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>, but officials said that was a formality.

 A swanky <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> restaurant that decided to offer the same elaborate meal, including turtle soup, seen in the Oscar-winning Danish film `` <PERSON> Babette </PERSON>'s Feast'' is in hot water with animal rights activists. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Weber </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> complains that the <LOCATION> Petrossian </LOCATION> restaurant is encouraging people to eat turtles, some of which are endangered. `` It's turtle exploitation,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Abbena </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Turtle </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Tortoise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Petrossian </PERSON>, however, says its `` Potage a la Tortue'' is made with the common freshwater snapping turtle, not the endangered sea turtles used in the movie's soup.

 Iranian gunboats attacked a Singapore-flagged oil tanker with machine guns and set it on fire today in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>, shipping executives reported. It was the second time in four days that Iranians raided a tanker near <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Farsi </LOCATION> island off <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>'s coast. The shipping sources, who spoke on condition of anonymity, identified today's target as the 87,768-ton <ORGANIZATION> Neptune </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Subaru </ORGANIZATION>. No casualties were reported. They said its Asian crew, including a Sri Lankan captain and sailors from <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, put out the fires, and the vessel sailed under its own power to the <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabian </LOCATION> port of <LOCATION> Jubail </LOCATION> for inspection. The <ORGANIZATION> Neptune </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Subaru </ORGANIZATION> was also hit by the Iranians in the <LOCATION> Strait </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hormuz </LOCATION>, gateway to the gulf, in March, the executives said. The tanker was empty and heading for <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> for a shipment of crude oil when the gunboats opened fire early today in a 45-minute raid. <LOCATION> Farsi </LOCATION> island is a base for <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s Revolutionary Guards, who often attack ships sailing to and from <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>. They also have been blamed for mining the waterway. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> has mounted a major mine-sweeping operation and sent several warships to patrol in the area. It was not immediately clear if any <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warship was nearby when the <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Subaru </LOCATION> was attacked today. The vessel was about 40 miles west of <LOCATION> Farsi </LOCATION>, near the Saudi island of Hurqus. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> had attacked several ships in that area earlier in the so-called `` tanker war,'' an offshoot of the 7 -LCB- - year-old gulf war In the exchanges, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> attacks <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s vital oil shipping lanes to try to throttle its foe's economy. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> retaliates by raiding neutral vessels, mainly those trading with <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>. The Persian state accuses these two oil powers of aiding <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s military effort Shipping sources said the skipper of the Neptune Subaru appeared to be on his first trip into the gulf. `` This captain, like others we encounter, came to the gulf with no prior knowledge whatsoever about the dangers of the tanker war or what precautions should be taken against ship attacks,'' said a shipping official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. On Saturday, the Iranians attacked the U.S.-owned, British-flagged <ORGANIZATION> Esso </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Demetia </ORGANIZATION> supertanker about 120 miles south of where the <LOCATION> Neptune </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Subaru </LOCATION> was raided. A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> frigate rushed to the scene, but its help was not needed. <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> registered 11 of its tankers in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> last year to entitle them to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> warship protection. The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> recently broadened the task of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> in the gulf by allowing warships to intervene in attacks on foreign commercial ships. Before the new policy went into effect May 3, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> was allowed to offer only humanitarian assistance. But <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has struck seven vessels in the waterway since then in apparent defiance of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>.

 Communist gunmen critically wounded a city policeman bathing outside his home today and scattered leaflets claiming responsibility for the attack, authorities and witnesses said. It was the second rebel attack on policemen in two days in the capital area. Police and witnesses said patrolman <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> <PERSON> dela </PERSON> <PERSON> Cruz </PERSON> was taking a bath outside his house in a slum district when four armed men arrived. One acted as a lookout while the others fired at dela <PERSON> Cruz </PERSON>, police said.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s 60,000 unionized civil servants began an indefinite strike today, disrupting work at courts and hospitals and bringing the nation's railway to a halt. The strike also affected the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, which stopped issuing passports and identity cards, the <ORGANIZATION> Employment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. At <LOCATION> Ben </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gurion </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, an emergency staff of only 10 out of 180 customs officials checked the luggage of passengers on incoming flights, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> army radio reported. A soldier guarding the <LOCATION> Tel-Aviv-Haifa </LOCATION> railway station told the radio he had to inform train passengers about the strike. `` They were amazed ... and thought I was joking. But after they heard, everybody said something, with all sorts of curses,'' the soldier said. A cab driver taking passengers from <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Haifa </LOCATION> said, `` When there's a strike, there's more work, but we prefer no strikes and order in the country.'' Tax offices were closed and disruptions were reported at the government-run hospitals where the strike affected administrative and maintenance staff. The Educational Television stopped its broadcasts, and court clerks did not report to work. The strike came after the failure of seven hours of talks Monday between the union of civil servants and the <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Yakov </PERSON> <PERSON> Danon </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>'s wage coordinator, warned that the ministry was ready to issue back-to-work orders. According to media reports, the ministry has also told the strikers it would exclude the strike days from their salaries. But union secretary <PERSON> Reuven </PERSON> <PERSON> Ben-Ami </PERSON> said the civil servants, whose average monthly salary is about $ 625, are `` ready to sacrifice to achieve better wages.'' `` We shall consider the continuation of the strike today. It may take several more days or stop tonight,'' <PERSON> Ben-Ami </PERSON> said on <ORGANIZATION> army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION>. Union officials said they are demanding an average wage increase of $ 77, a raise in medical payments and an increase in the annual recreation period covered by these payments to 15 days instead of 11.

<HEAD>FBI Seeks Man Suspected in 30 Bank Robberies</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A bank robber dubbed `` the gentleman bandit'' because of his penchant for three-piece suits and his soft-spoken manner in dozens of holdups, has changed his clothes and his pattern, says the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>. The robber, who's averaged one to three holdups a month since his 30-bank spree in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> began in 1986, pulled his last heist in <LOCATION> Naples </LOCATION> on March 21, <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said in asking the public for help Monday. `` It does look like his pattern has been broken, but whether he's been arrested for something else or is sick from narcotics abuse, we do n't know,'' <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said. `` That's part of the reason we want to get some publicity.'' The bandit, who is about 30 years old, could be pulling the robberies to feed a drug habit, <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said. Investigators base that theory on photographs taken during robberies that show the man growing thinner. The bandit also has recently stowed his three-piece suit for more casual garb, and has shaved off his beard, <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> officials said. The robber usually carries a folder or accordion-type briefcase, <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said. While the soft-spoken man has threatened bodily harm in notes to tellers, he rarely displays a weapon and no one has been hurt. Thousands of dollars have been taken, but <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> did not give an amount. Because of the robber's mobility and familiarity with different cities and exit routes, investigators believe he has a legitimate job, possibly as a traveling salesman, <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said. Investigators speculate the man does not live near the banks he robs because no one has come forward to help identify him, even though robbery photos have been publicized. `` We're hoping somebody who owns a motel or a hotel might recognize him as a steady client,'' <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> said.

 Many Armenians who joined a strike to demand annexation of a disputed region of neighboring <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> returned to work today after being assured that their republic's government would press their demand. But the Azerbaijani government voted to reject ceding control of the <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> region, which is predominantly Armenian. <PERSON> Mofses </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorgisyan </PERSON>, an Armenian jailed in April and May for staging nationalist demonstrations, said a general strike shut down most businesses in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> on Monday, but that today `` some people are working, maybe half.'' He said students agitating for annexation had for three weeks staged a sit-in outside the Opera Theater in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>, capital of the southern republic. <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> was assigned to <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> in 1923. Most Azerbaijanis are Moslems and most Armenians are Christians. <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>'s official <ORGANIZATION> Baku </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> reported today that the executive committee of that republic's legislature met Monday in the Azerbaijani capital, <LOCATION> Baku </LOCATION>, and turned down a request by <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> officials that their territory be transferred to <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>. The report, monitored by the <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, said the Presidium of the republic's Supreme Soviet found the demand `` unacceptable'' because it would be `` contrary to the interests of the Azerbaijani and Armenian population of the republic and would be incompatible with the tasks of consolidating the friendship between all the peoples of our country, as well as with the task of reconstruction.'' It said the annexation request came from the <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> Autonomous Region's Soviet of <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deputies </ORGANIZATION>, one of two chambers of the region's legislature. A request from the same body in February touched off massive street demonstrations and strikes in <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>'s legislature is to meet Wednesday to discuss the annexation demand. <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>'s new <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> leader, <PERSON> Suren </PERSON> <PERSON> Arutyunyan </PERSON>, told more than 500,000 demonstrators in <LOCATION> Yerevan </LOCATION> on Monday that the Armenian Supreme Soviet would `` decide positively'' on their claim, according to <LOCATION> Gorgisyan </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> <PERSON> Grigoryants </PERSON>, a dissident journalist in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gorgisyan </PERSON> quoted <PERSON> Arutyunyan </PERSON> as saying a majority of Supreme Soviet deputies indicated they support annexation. He said the speech was replayed three times on Armenian television, apparently in an effort to persuade people to return to their jobs. Since the Azerbaijani legislature has rejected the annexation demand, if the Armenian Supreme Soviet calls for transfer of <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>, the issue would have to be decided by the central government in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> officials have rejected the demand once. <PERSON> Gorgisyan </PERSON> said Armenians believe the next move is up to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>: `` We are interested in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s answer. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> has been silent so far.'' Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> got involved in the issue in February, appealing to Armenians and Azerbaijanis to be calm and promising the dispute would be reviewed. The Kremlin later rejected the annexation demand and the central government instead approved a package of social and cultural improvements for <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>. According to <PERSON> Gorgisyan </PERSON>, three Armenians have been lying on the square outside the Opera Theater on a hunger strike since June 4. He estimated that 2,000 to 5,000 people were gathered on the square, where the latest round of demonstrations began May 25. A worker at the Yerevan Hotel said the general strike was still on and demonstrators were making speeches and holding posters. `` It's very peaceful. People are highly cultured,'' said the worker. The phone conversation was cut off before a reporter could ask the woman's name. The ethnic dispute has erupted into violence several times. In late February and early March 32 people, mostly Armenians, were killed in riots in the Azerbaijani city of <LOCATION> Sumgait </LOCATION>. On Monday, <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> said an Azerbaijani officer was killed by shotgun fire from an Armenian during protests in <LOCATION> Baku </LOCATION>. He did not say precisely when the shooting occurred. There were unconfirmed reports Saturday of large-scale protests in <LOCATION> Baku </LOCATION>. Also Monday, the party leader of <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Rahman </PERSON> <PERSON> Vezirov </PERSON>, told workers in <LOCATION> Baku </LOCATION> that they were correct in resisting Armenians' demands to give up <LOCATION> Nagorno-Karabakh </LOCATION>. Communist Party authorities put <PERSON> Vezirov </PERSON> in charge of <LOCATION> Azerbaijan </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Arutyunyan </PERSON> in charge of <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION> on May 21, apparently firing their predecessors for not containing the dispute.

 A man who romanced a cashier, robbed her and beat her to death with a hammer was electrocuted today, becoming the nation's 100th person executed since capital punishment resumed in 1977. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, 28, had argued that he did not intend to kill the woman during the 1984 gas station robbery. But he said Monday he had dated her with the intent of robbing her, knowing she handled large sums of money. And he said when he tried to knock her unconscious, `` It did n't work. She did n't become unconscious. I just kept hitting her until she did.'' Eighteen of the 100 executions since the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> reinstated the death penalty have been in <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>, which is tied with <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> for the second-highest number nationally. <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> has put 27 people to death. Thirty-seven states enacted capital punishment laws after the 1976 <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling. A coroner pronounced <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON> dead at 12:12 a.m., said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>, deputy secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Louisiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corrections </ORGANIZATION>. Three state and federal courts Monday refused requests by <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON>'s lawyers to block the execution. <LOCATION> Louisiana </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Pardon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> also refused to recommend a commutation of his sentence to life imprisonment. Six pro-capital punishment demonstrators waited outside the prison for confirmation of <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON>'s death. One held a sign reading `` Thanks, <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>,'' alluding to the pseudonym used by officials to protect the anonymity of the executioner. The sign-carrier identified himself as <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Reece </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Pineville </LOCATION>. He said he felt deprived because the man who killed his 16-year-old stepdaughter was sentenced to life imprisonment. `` It gives us a sense of justice to see this done to him -LRB- <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON> -RRB-,'' <PERSON> Reece </PERSON> said. `` It does n't make me happy to see someone die, but it gives me a sense of satisfaction to see justice served.'' <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON> showed no emotion when he entered the death chamber. Asked if he had any final words, <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON> smirked, shook his head and replied: `` Nope.'' After he was strapped into the electric chair and masked, <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON> drummed his fingers while awaiting the first of four surges of electricity. <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON>, who was convicted of first-degree murder, insisted he never intended to kill <PERSON> Roberta </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, 25, who was bludgeoned with a hammer during the $ 7,000 robbery at the <LOCATION> Bossier </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> service station. `` I do n't know exactly what it is that I can say to y' all I was planning to rob this woman all along. It was all set up. There were no flaws that I could see,'' <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON> said in a pardon board hearing Monday at the penitentiary. Defense attorneys and a university professor who came to know <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON> portrayed him as a penitent killer and as a sensitive, articulate jailhouse poet who helped other inmates write letters to loved ones. `` It was a premeditated robbery, but not a premeditated murder. This was a robbery that went sour,'' defense attorney <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Baumgartner </PERSON> said. But District Attorney <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> called <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON> manipulative, roguish and cruel. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> said <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON> was caught in a hotel room the morning after the killing, with a barmaid he had picked up at a tavern and proposed marriage to. Parked outside was a car <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON> had stolen from the woman he lived with before getting involed with <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, the prosecutor said. <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON>'s court appeals were based on numerous arguments, among them that he should have had 90 days to appeal an adverse federal appeals court ruling handed down May 9. But those arguments were turned aside Monday by the <ORGANIZATION> Louisiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, the 5th <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> and, finally, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Hilton </PERSON> <PERSON> Butler </PERSON>, warden of the <ORGANIZATION> Louisiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Penitentiary </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON> spent Monday alone or with his lawyers. <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> described <PERSON> Byrne </PERSON> as `` calm'' Monday night. Gov. <PERSON> Buddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Roemer </PERSON> made no effort to intervene in the first execution since he took office in March.

 Police stormed a barricaded church run by a fundamentalist minister, taking custody of some of his supporters and residents of the home for troubled youths he operated. At least seven people, including the church's assistant pastor, were arrested Monday at <ORGANIZATION> Bethel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, authorities said. At least three dozen children were taken from the church after about 60 state troopers, local police officers and sheriff's deputies entered it following a four-hour standoff, witnesses said Law officers, who were searching for three children who returned to the home after a judge temporarily closed it, moved into the white wood-frame church after unsuccessful attempts to negotiate a settlement. As officers entered the building, some church members sang hymns and quoted Scripture. Some asked, `` If this is n't Nazi <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, what is?'' The state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Welfare </ORGANIZATION> took custody of 11 children after they were interviewed, but it was uncertain if all had been former residents of the <LOCATION> Bethel </LOCATION> Home for Children. Authorities said they took all the youngsters in the church because church officials refused to point out the three who had returned to the home after its closing. <ORGANIZATION> Bethel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION>'s pastor, the Rev. <PERSON> Herman </PERSON> <PERSON> Fountain </PERSON>, was arrested twice Monday, the first time along with two staff members and a 17-year-old after a fight broke out at the home. The second arrest came after Fountain got involved in a shoving match with a law officer outside the courthouse. On Friday, Chancery Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Oswald </PERSON> ordered all the residents of the school temporarily placed in state custody. <PERSON> Oswald </PERSON> ruled that the children, ages 10 to 17, had been subjected `` to physical abuse, medical neglect and detention amounting to imprisonment.'' The public welfare department removed 64 children, but many others fled the home. Twenty-two of the 64 were released over the weekend to parents or guardians, state officials said. On Monday, <PERSON> Oswald </PERSON> began hearing the cases of the 42 youngsters placed in state custody. Fountain refused to respond to <PERSON> Oswald </PERSON>'s questions about the whereabouts of the runaways, and the judge issued 11 subpoenas to the home's staff members. Fountain returned to the campus in the early afternoon and told staff members not to comply with the subpoenas. After the shoving match, Fountain _ with no shoes, his hair and clothes ruffled _ was returned to court, where he told <PERSON> Oswald </PERSON> that he was sheltering three children, but would answer no other questions. <PERSON> Oswald </PERSON> asked Fountain to help prevent `` any bloodshed or violence,'' but the Baptist minister said there was nothing he could do. After the report of the campus fracas in which <PERSON> Fountain </PERSON> was arrested, <PERSON> Oswald </PERSON> asked that a grand jury be called to consider whether Fountain should be indicted for obstruction of justice. <PERSON> Oswald </PERSON> said at the end of the day he had released seven children to their parents after reviewing their cases. He said they agreed not to send their children back to the school without court approval. Earlier, <PERSON> Fountain </PERSON> said he believed the home had housed about 120 children. He said he did not know the whereabouts of those missing. The number of children at large was unknown because Fountain refused to honor a court order to provide a list with names and addresses of the children and their parents. Outside court, several parents said they wanted their children back in the home rather than the state's custody. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Boca </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Raton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, who said she had a 16-year-old son at <LOCATION> Bethel </LOCATION>, said she and her husband refused to pick him up because they did not want to sign the agreement that would bar him from returning to the home. `` Brother Fountain through <LOCATION> Bethel </LOCATION> saved our child's life,'' she said. `` When a child is on drugs, you need the help of religion to get off drugs.'' State Welfare Commissioner <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brittain </PERSON> said Saturday that medical examinations of some children showed excessive use of corporal punishment.

<HEAD>Dollar, Gold Little Changed as Markets Await U.S. Trade Data</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The dollar was little changed in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> this morning as markets awaited the release later in the day of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade data. Gold made slight gains. Dealers said the dollar might strengthen if forecasters were correct in predicting an increase in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade gap from $ 11.95 billion in March to a seasonally adjusted $ 12.2 billion in April. One dealer in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> said this would leave the dollar room to rise, but another said: `` There was a lot of optimism after the last -LRB- trade -RRB- figures, but the new figures will remind the market that the deficit is still around, and that it wo n't fall below $ 10 billion any time soon. And the central banks do n't want the dollar to rise either.'' A dealer in <LOCATION> Milan </LOCATION> commented: `` Any result above $ 12 billion will just remind traders how stubborn a problem the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade imbalance is.'' In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where trading ends before <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s business day begins, the dollar fell 0.14 yen to a closing 125.05. Later, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it was quoted at 125.12 yen. Other dollar rates at mid-morning, compared with late Monday: _ 1.7249 West German marks, up from 1.7241 _ 1.4414 Swiss francs, down from 1.4424 _ 5.8210 French francs, up from 5.7265 _ 1.9349 Dutch guilders, up from 1.9345 _ 1.281.00 Italian lire, down from 1,281.75 _ 1.2185 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2203 In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the British pound was quoted at $ 1.8150, compared with $ 1.8165 Monday. Gold opened in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> at a bid price of $ 450.20 a troy ounce, compared with late Monday's $ 449.00. At mid-morning Tuesday, the city's five major bullion dealers fixed a recommended price of $ 450.80. In <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, the bid price was $ 450.70, up from $ 448.50 late Monday. Earlier, in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, where trading resumed following a long weekend, gold closed down $ 5.41 at a bid $ 452.58. Silver was quoted in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> today at a bid price of $ 6.98 a troy ounce, down from Monday's $ 7.02.

<HEAD>Quakes Rocking California Are Unrelated, Seismologist Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SANTA BARBARA, Calif. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A series of small to moderate earthquakes that have shaken <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> from nearly one end to the other the past few days are unrelated, a seismologist says. The latest quake, measuring 3.0 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale, shook this coastal community Monday. No injuries or damage were reported, said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Finn </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION>'s seismology lab in <LOCATION> Pasadena </LOCATION> It followed a 2.3 magnitude quake Monday morning centered in the <LOCATION> Playa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> del </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rey </LOCATION> area near <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. The two <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> quakes and more than a dozen quakes and aftershocks that rattled Northern and <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> over the weekend occurred on different faults, said <ORGANIZATION> Caltech </ORGANIZATION> seismologist <PERSON> Kate </PERSON> <PERSON> Hutton </PERSON>. While their timing was `` slightly odd,'' she said, it was only coincidental. On Sunday evening, a quake centered 10 miles northeast of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and measuring 5.3 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale broke windows, emptied supermarket shelves and knocked children off their feet. That afternoon, a 3.4 quake rolled through the <LOCATION> Ontario </LOCATION> area, 30 miles inland from <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. Twenty-four minutes later a 3.3 quake jolted <LOCATION> Napa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Solano </LOCATION> counties in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. No damage or injuries were reported in either. On Friday, a 5.2 quake hit the <PERSON> Garlock </PERSON> fault near <LOCATION> Gorman </LOCATION>, 60 miles north of downtown <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> .2 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale It was followed by two aftershocks measuring 4.0 and 3.4. That quake forced the temporary closure of the 440-mile <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> Aqueduct. Two Civil War-era buildings at the <ORGANIZATION> Fort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tejon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Historic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> also suffered quake damage. An earthquake of 3.5 on the <PERSON> Richter </PERSON> scale can cause slight damage in the local area, one measuring 4 can cause moderate damage and one at 5 can cause considerable damage. Quakes of higher magnitude can cause severe damage.

 Two militant Sikh separatists rushed out of the <ORGANIZATION> Golden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> complex today, attacked paramilitary troops with swords and wounded two before they were shot dead, police said. Elsewhere in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> state, a gang of Sikh extremists raided a village north of <LOCATION> Amritsar </LOCATION> on Monday night and shot nine people to death, including eight Hindus, police said. One of the victims was a 10-year-old girl. The attack at the Golden Temple occurred just outside the main entrance, where police set up a post a month ago to search everybody entering the Sikh religion's holiest shrine. The searches are intended to keep Sikh extremists from sneaking weapons into the shrine. Sikh radicals have been fighting a guerrilla war since 1982 for a separate homeland in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>. The two <ORGANIZATION> Sikh </ORGANIZATION> radicals apparently had escaped earlier police detection, said M.S. <PERSON> Sethi </PERSON>, superintendent of the paramilitary <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>. They grabbed swords from shops near the temple gate and began slashing at paramilitary forces, <PERSON> Sethi </PERSON> said. He said two of his men were wounded before the assailants were shot to death by other troops. Police and paramilitary forces besieged the Golden Temple May 9-18 to drive out extremists who had turned the shrine into an armed camp. At least 46 people were killed during the siege, most of them militants. More than 200 radicals and sympathizers surrendered. The government has begun buying and demolishing buildings with 30 yards of the <ORGANIZATION> Golden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Temple </ORGANIZATION> complex to prevent extremists from using them as cover to sneak into the shrine. The attack on the Hindus Monday night was in the village of <LOCATION> Chakpamani </LOCATION>, about 22 miles north of <LOCATION> Amritsar </LOCATION>. Police said up to 10 Sikh extremists arrived at the village on foot and entered several Hindu homes, killing seven people. The Sikh servant of the village's Hindu leader, <PERSON> Kishan </PERSON> <PERSON> Chand </PERSON>, tried to ward off the attackers but was killed, police said. <PERSON> Chand </PERSON>'s 10-year-old daughter was shot to death, but <PERSON> Chand </PERSON> escaped injury, they said. The killings in <LOCATION> Chakpamani </LOCATION> raised to nearly 1,290 the number of people killed by Sikh extremists in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> since the start of the year. Last year, 1,030 people died. Most of the victims have been Hindus or moderate Sikhs opposed to the separatist campaign. Sikhs, whose religion was formed about 500 years ago as an alternative to <LOCATION> Hinduism </LOCATION> and Islam, claim they are discriminated against by <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s majority Hindus. Sikhs make up less than 2 percent of <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s 800 million people but are a majority in <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION>.

 A <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> man doctors call the `` super spreader'' has infected at least four women with AIDS and is still having sexual encounters, according to a report released today. `` He has infected four out of five of his partners that we have seen, but we do n't know all of his partners,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Padian </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Berkeley </LOCATION>. In other research presented today, Dr. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Haseltine </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Dana-Farber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> described the discovery of a gene in the AIDS virus that seems to slow the virus' proliferation inside the body. Ms. <PERSON> Padian </PERSON> said the `` super spreader'' _ a hemophiliac infected through contaminated blood products _ is in his 20s, lives in southern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and is still healthy with no signs of acquired immune deficiency syndrome. Ms. <PERSON> Padian </PERSON> outlined the outbreak attributed to this man as part of a study of infection rates among women who engage in risky sex. `` He is now using condoms,'' she said. `` We asked him to tell'' women about his AIDS infection, `` but we ca n't guarantee he is doing that.'' Ms. <PERSON> Padian </PERSON> and <PERSON> Haseltine </PERSON> dsecribed their findings at the <ORGANIZATION> Fourth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> on AIDS. <PERSON> Haseltine </PERSON> said the new gene, dubbed vpu, has been isolated by his and two other research labs. `` The virus without this gene grows faster,'' he said. He said the gene is one of four in the complex AIDS avirus that regulate the speed with which it makes new copies of itself inside infected cells. `` Now we have two genes that speed the virus up and two that slow it down,'' <PERSON> Haseltine </PERSON> said. Researchers believe it may be possible to shut down the AIDS virus with drugs that could manipulate the microbe's built-in control genes. Among research described at the meeting Monday: _ Dr <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> said that between 20 and 25 health care workers around the world have become infected with AIDS as a result of on-the-job exposure to the virus. `` We are now almost a decade since the transmission of the virus became reasonably common,'' he said. `` We are still looking at a very small number of people who get infected in the health-care setting.'' _ Dr <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Broder </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> said that the experimental anti-AIDS drug CD4 `` still looks very promising,'' despite concerns that it may not protect against the spread of AIDS to the brain. _ Dr <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Levy </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> said it appears that some of the body's own antibodies actually help the AIDS virus get into blood cells. He said vaccine developers should be careful not to accidentally aid the virus by prompting the body to make antibodies that the microbe needs. _ Researchers from three countries presented six cases in which babies caught the AIDS virus while breast feeding They said the risk appears to be especially high if the mother becomes infected with the virus after she gives birth. _ Dr <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Goedert </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> said the approximately 1 million Americans already carrying the virus are growing more infectious, so they are more likely to spread the disease to uninfected people. _ Dr <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Dondero </PERSON> reported the first results of the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION>'s efforts to learn how many Americans are infected with the AIDS virus by testing blood from hospital patients In testing in six hospitals, three of every 1,000 people were infected, but the rate does not appear to be increasing. _ Dr Bosenge N'Galy of the <ORGANIZATION> Zaire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> said the infection rate also seems to have stabilized in <LOCATION> Kinshasa </LOCATION>, the nation's capital. It has remained at about 7 percent among pregnant women since 1985. _ Dr <PERSON> Hiroaki </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitsuya </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> said that dextran sulfate, a drug used to lower cholesterol, may block AIDS infection. In the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> study, Ms. <PERSON> Padian </PERSON> said the `` super spreader'' was somehow more infectious than most carriers of the virus, perhaps because he was infected with a more contagious variety of the AIDS virus. Dr. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Seague </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospitals </ORGANIZATION> said, `` It's very feasible that this phenomenon might occur. Some strains of the virus might be more readily spread.'' Ms. <PERSON> Padian </PERSON> said one of the infected women had sex with the man 704 times, one 300 times and one 15 times. The fourth did not know how many contacts she'd had. She said her research on other women shows a tremendous variation in infectivity from person to person. Seven women studied got the virus after less than 100 sexual encounters with infected men, while 19 others remained free of the virus after more than 1,000 exposures.

 A Norwegian unit of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping force was locked in a tense confrontation with <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops in southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> today, <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> sources said. Elsewhere in southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, four Lebanese villagers were killed and four others wounded when <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> gunners shelled Shiite Moslem guerrilla hideouts in <LOCATION> Tibnin </LOCATION> valley before dawn, police said. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> sources said <LOCATION> Norwegian </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops faced each other through the night, fingers on triggers, as flares illuminated the skies over the foothills of <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hermon </LOCATION>. `` They're still squared off in a tense confrontation,'' one <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> source said at midmorning. He spoke on condition of anonymity. The source said the tension developed after Norwegian peacekeepers blocked <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> troops two days ago from setting up a checkpoint close to a Norwegian outpost on the southern edge of <LOCATION> Hebbariyeh </LOCATION>. The village is seven miles north of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s self-designated security zone in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. It has a Norwegian garrison of nine. The source said a mechanized <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> unit rolled into Hebbariyeh Monday, encircled the Norwegian checkpoint and `` warned the peacekeepers that they will be treated as trespassers on Israeli territory if they leave their post.'' <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Timur </PERSON> <PERSON> Goksel </PERSON> confirmed the confrontation and said 20 Israeli troops in two armored personnel carriers and a bulldozer were surrounding the Norwegian position. <PERSON> Goksel </PERSON> said 50 other Norwegian troops were dispatched to <LOCATION> Hebbariyeh </LOCATION> to help the encircled position. They removed barbed-wire barricades set by the Israelis around the checkpoint, he said. <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> has an 881-strong battalion in the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interim </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> UNIFIL </ORGANIZATION> comprises 5,800 troops drawn from nine nations. <ORGANIZATION> UNIFIL </ORGANIZATION> deployed in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in 1978 to serve as a buffer between Palestinian guerrillas and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s northern border. Its area overlaps with the security zone <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> carved out in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in 1985. `` <ORGANIZATION> UNIFIL </ORGANIZATION> is against any <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> position to be set up in <ORGANIZATION> UNIFIL </ORGANIZATION> area because it will cause a lot of tension,'' <PERSON> Goksel </PERSON> said. He said contacts were under way to ease the Hebbariyeh tension, which he said was still running high this morning. Police said the <LOCATION> Tibnin </LOCATION> valley shelling apparently was prompted by reports in the security zone of `` abnormal guerrilla activity in the area.'' Thirty mortar rounds crashed in and around <LOCATION> Tibnin </LOCATION> overnight. All eight casualties were civilians, police said.

 <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s largest Presbyterian group urged <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to end its occupation of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, calling its response to the Palestinian uprising `` heavy-handed,'' and today was considering its policy on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> anti-nuclear dissent. The 200th General Assembly of the Presbyterian Church -LRB- <LOCATION> U.S.A. </LOCATION> -RRB- also was to select a top denominational officer in an election today taking precedence over other business facing the 630 delegates. The assembly on Monday approved 494-67 its statement calling on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to end its occupation of the territories seized during the Six-Day War of 1967. The statement from the 3 million-member Protestant denomination said <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s `` heavy-handed crackdown'' during the 6-month-old Palestinian uprising `` portends what lies ahead unless a political settlement is reached.'' It asked <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to `` cease the systemic violation of human rights of Palestinians,'' such as beatings, and food and fuel embargoes. The denomination urged <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to suspend settlement programs in the occupied territories, `` since these simply provoke the Arab peoples and reduce the opportunity for a peaceful resolution of the conflicting claims of Israelis and Palestinians.'' It also: _ Called on <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> and their leaders to try to control violence to ease the peace process. _ Asked the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to `` discourage retaliation as a counter-terror strategy in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> and to address the injustices which are among the root causes of terrorism.'' The statement urged the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to insist that weapons supplied for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s defense not be used against civilians in the occupied territories or in `` aggressive attacks or disproportionate retaliation upon other countries.'' _ Asked all parties to participate in a United Nations-sponsored international peace conference. Today, the assembly was to begin discussing its statement on `` Christian Obedience in a Nuclear Age.'' The statement, which stemmed from a request five years ago by local Presbyterian groups for guidance on how to respond to tax resisters, was revised in lengthy meetings at the assembly by three committees. The recommendations were edited to make it clear that while tax resistance and other acts of civil disobedience could be justified, Christians normally are expected to obey civil authorities. The statement was edited in an effort to remove any doubt that disobedience is not a normal course. A section was added saying military service could be an appropriate response to a Christian's conscience The committees reworded discussion of nuclear deterrence, but left alone the declaration that nuclear war itself is immoral. The original paper said nuclear deterrence assumes the willingness to use such weapons and is therefore immoral, although it said unilateral disarmament is not yet feasible. The final recommended statement said `` nuclear deterrence has been in danger of being regarded as an adequate and permanent means to national security rather an interim measure of self-defense. Such a policy as an end in itself is not morally defensible.'' The Presbyterians also were to elect the stated clerk, who is the officer responsible for overseeing the assembly's operation. On Saturday, a committee said it would nominate <PERSON> Harriet </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, a lay leader from <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, surprising many who expected the panel to nominate two people, including the Rev. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Andrews </PERSON>. Andrews, interim co-stated clerk or stated clerk since the denomination was formed in 1973 from the merger of the Presbyterian Church -LRB- <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> -RRB- and the Presbyterian Church -LRB- <LOCATION> U.S.A. </LOCATION> -RRB-, has said he will be nominated from the floor.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> on Tuesday protested about 150 incidents of brutality against journalists by police and soldiers. The 200-member association issued the statement at a news conference and focused on an incident in which police beat up two foreign photograpers at a demonstration in <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> this month. The beating was witnessed by other photographers. `` We demand that the ministry of police investigate and punish those who took part in that incident,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Slater </PERSON>, the chairman of the press association. `` We deplore the statements by public officials that have created an odious public atmosphere.'' All the incidents protested occurred in the past six months. <PERSON> Slater </PERSON>, a correspondent for <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> magazine </ORGANIZATION>, said government officials had made repeated statements indicating that the foreign press fanned the flames of the Arab uprising, which began Dec. 8. He said such statements `` left in the minds of the public the idea that we have orchestrated events, paid kids to throw stones ... and this has encouraged 19 - and 20-year-old soldiers to do their thing as they see fit. In the June 4 <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> incident, photographers <PERSON> Sven </PERSON> <PERSON> Nackstrand </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Agence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> France </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Andre </PERSON> <PERSON> Brutmann </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Alfa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> were beaten by plainclothes and uniformed police while they photographed a demonstration against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s occupation of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. `` I was hit in all directions and struck to the ground. I received five or six hard hits on the head, and one felt like an explosion,'' <PERSON> Nackstrand </PERSON> told reporters. <PERSON> Nackstrand </PERSON>, who has worked seven years in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, said he was then thrown near a police van and a few minutes later pulled into the van. He was held in the van for about 10 minutes until a senior officer, apparently realizing he was a journalist, ordered him released. <PERSON> Slater </PERSON> said the Police Ministry did n't answer a cable sent a week ago protesting the incident. Police Ministry spokeswoman <PERSON> Mira </PERSON> <PERSON> Firestein </PERSON> said her office received the cable and asked police in <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> to investigate and was still awaiting a reply.

 Sens. <PERSON> Alfonse </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, D-Tenn., proposed legislation Tuesday that would require the <ORGANIZATION> Consumer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Product </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> to ban the sale of three-wheeled all-terrrain vehicles and establishing a procedure for owners to obtain refunds `` Consumers who bought ATVs not knowing their inherent dangers deserve a refund,'' <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON> said at a news conference. `` The surest way to limit ATV-related deaths and injuries is to get these machines out of the hands of our children.'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> said the off-road sports vehicles have been linked to nearly 1,000 deaths and more than 350,000 injuries requiring medical treatment since 1982. `` Tragically, children are often the victims of ATV accidents,'' he said. `` In fact, nearly one-half of the injuries and deaths have been caused to children under the age of 16.'' The legislation would require the <ORGANIZATION> CPSC </ORGANIZATION> to: _ Issue a rule within 60 days of the bill's passage banning the sale of all three-wheeled ATVs; _ Issue a rule within 120 days under which refunds would be available to purchasers of three-wheeled ATVs or those who bought them for children under 16; _ Create a rule within 120 days requiring ATV distributors to provide hands-on training to owners of the vehicles and members of their immediate families; _ Within a year, establish performance standards and design characteristics to make ATVs safer, including age requirements for the safe Of the 2.5 million ATVs now in use, about two-thirds are three-wheeled models. The rest have four wheels. `` The Consumer Product <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> has not done an adequate job in protecting the consumer from the inherent risks and dangers associated with ATVs,'' <PERSON> D'Amato </PERSON> said. `` It is time for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to force their hand in this matter.'' <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Terrence </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Scanlon </PERSON> said in a statement that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> had the right to consider such legislation, but he argued that a consent decree signed in April with the industry `` should be given adequate time to provide the necessary protection for ATV users and their families.'' The decree between the <ORGANIZATION> CPSC </ORGANIZATION> and five ATV manufacturers banned the sale of three-wheeled ATVs unless the manufacturers can devise performance standards that are approved by the commission. The decree also requires that warning labels be placed on four-wheeled models and that distributors provide training in the safe use of all types of ATVs to people who purchased the vehicles after Dec. 30, 1986. Also, the decree requires manufacturers to spend $ 8.5 million to warn consumers about the hazards of ATVs and to promote training. CSPC Commissioner <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> had voted against the consent decree because it lacked a recall provision. <PERSON> Carol </PERSON> <PERSON> Dawson </PERSON>, the third member of the commission, voted for it but said consumers deserved the right to a reasonable refund if they so desired. The D'Amato-Gore bill requires the <ORGANIZATION> CPSC </ORGANIZATION> to establish the dollar amount of any refunds, based on the age and condition of the ATVs.

 <LOCATION> Montgomery </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> residents upset about a tax increase know where to gripe, thanks to a sign posted in a county office listing the home telephone number of four tax-raising supervisors. Treasurer <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON> <PERSON> Meredith </PERSON> posted the sign to ward off complaints. `` I have had an enormous number of people who come into the office, and they direct their complaints to me as if I'm the one who raises taxes,'' <PERSON> Meredith </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON> says the sign is just a source of information, but the supervisors see it another way.

Ms. <PERSON> Hess </PERSON> said she received calls from people who objected to the sign, but none from tax opponents. Earlier this year, the supervisors voted 4-3 to approve a 16.7 percent property tax increase in this southeastern <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> county. <PERSON> Meredith </PERSON>, who had opposed the increase, defended the sign. `` If they vote to raise taxes, then they ought to be man or woman enough to stand up outside the board meeting and say, ` I was responsible for it,''' <PERSON> Meredith </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Senators Try to Craft Bill Acceptable to Administration</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Senators worked Tuesday to craft a welfare-overhaul bill acceptable to the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration but said they would move ahead with the landmark, work-oriented measure if no compromise could be reached. `` We're either going to wind it up ... or go out there -LRB- on the floor -RRB- and start battling it out,'' said Republican Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION>. `` It's not very clear what will satisfy the administration, and that makes it very difficult,'' said Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Chafee </PERSON>, R-R.I. Sen. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Moynihan </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, author and chief sponsor of the five-year, $ 2.6 billion Family Security Act, said closed-door negotiations on his popular bill would go on all day and possibly into Wednesday. Asked if the administration appeared to want a welfare bill, he replied, `` I think they do n't want to veto a bill.'' Aides have said President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> will do just that if senators do not agree to demands that include broader state flexibility to experiment with demonstration projects and a guaranteed rate of welfare recipient participation in broad new education, training and employment programs. <PERSON> Moynihan </PERSON>'s bill would require states to institute new work and training programs and enroll as many welfare parents as they could afford, with special emphasis on teen-age mothers and others who are or are likely to be long-term recipients. As part of its emphasis on parental responsibility, the bill also requires extensive state efforts to determine paternity and automatic wage withholding immediately upon the awarding of child support. <PERSON> Moynihan </PERSON>'s bill has 64 sponsors in the 100-member <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, and an aide said two additional senators support it. Before going to the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, it would have to be reconciled with a similar but much more expensive <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> bill passed last December. It is unclear whether either the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> or the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> could muster the two-thirds majority needed to override a presidential veto. <PERSON> Moynihan </PERSON> has been fighting mandatory participation rates on behalf of the nation's governors, who fear that with their limited resources, they would have to provide cursory services to the least needy people in order to meet the required level. Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Packwood </PERSON>, R-Ore., said senators were discussing a mandatory 10 percent or 15 percent participation rate, rising eventually to 25 percent The administration wanted to go higher than that, he said. Senators said Monday that the administration was seeking a universal, mandatory and expensive workfare program, but the issue appeared to have evaporated by Tuesday. `` That's not even under discussion,'' <PERSON> Moynihan </PERSON> said. `` There will not be a compulsory -LRB- work -RRB- requirement from the federal level,'' <PERSON> Packwood </PERSON> said. `` The states will have a lot of options.'' <PERSON> Moynihan </PERSON> also said the administration was no longer fighting a new requirement that states make welfare benefits available to two-parent families at least six months in a year. Twenty-six states already provide year-round coverage.

<HEAD>House Panel OKs Product Liability Bill Opposed by Consumerists</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT M. ANDREWS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> approved a controversial product liability bill Tuesday that consumer activists immediately denounced as a pro-business assault on the legal rights of victims of hazardous products. The bipartisan compromise, which is given virtually no chance of passing <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> this year, would establish uniform federal liability standards for lawsuits over defective consumer goods. Conflicting but generally stronger state laws would be pre-empted. Business lobbyists said a federal law would ease the growing burden of liability insurance costs and result in lower consumer prices. Consumer groups said the bill would make it harder for victims to recover damages from manufacturers of unsafe products. The bill, described by Rep. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Florio </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.J. </LOCATION>, as `` complex and politically charged,'' was approved 30-12 with the unanimous support of the committee's 17 Republicans and a bare 13-member majority of its 25 Democrats. It was the first time a product liability bill had ever cleared a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> committee. A similar measure died on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor in late 1986 after a filibuster led by <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hollings </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-S.C. </LOCATION>, an adamant foe of such legislation. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> measure now heads for further study by an unfriendly <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, which shares jurisdiction and traditionally has favored trial lawyers in their opposition to such bills. `` We are getting ready for a fight in Judiciary,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Synar </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Okla </LOCATION>., who had won the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> panel's approval of several pro-consumer amendments during more than a month of wrangling over the Consumer lobbyists lost no time castigating the bill and its supporters. `` Since 1981, <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> industry has been battering away at <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, trying to get a pre-emptive federal product liability law passed that would give manufacturers and sellers greater opportunity to place dangerous products on the market with diminished liability to the people they injure,'' said <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Claybrook </PERSON>, president of Public Citizen. `` Today a majority of the committee brought that consumer nightmare a little closer to reality,'' she said. Consumer advocate <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> Nader </PERSON> said the committee had sided with `` toxic chemical producers, dangerously defective product manufacturers and other promoters of corporate violence.'' <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Trowbridge </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION>, said the bill provides a `` fair and responsible'' overhaul of product liability laws. He said it would `` help curb the number of unwarranted lawsuits,'' stimulate the economy and reduce consumer prices. `` Everyone _ except the nation's trial lawyers _ wins under this bill,'' <PERSON> Trowbridge </PERSON> said. A major feature protested by consumer advocates is the `` state of the art'' defense made available to manufacturers under the bill. That provision says manufacturers can escape liability for damages if they can prove they did not know _ or could not know _ of a design defect with knowledge `` reasonably available to experts,'' or if there was no feasible alternative design. <PERSON> Synar </PERSON> won approval of an amendment putting the burden of proof on the manufacturer rather than the consumer. The committee also accepted a pro-consumer `` escape hatch'' sponsored by <PERSON> Synar </PERSON> that would require plaintiffs to prove only that the product was so unsafe compared with its usefulness that it should not have been marketed. Another <PERSON> Synar </PERSON> provision would ease the standard of proof that plaintiffs must meet in suing manufacturers. But consumer interests are unhappy over his proposal to give a judge rather than a trial jury the responsibility for deciding whether a product should have been barred from the market because of safety hazards. Critics say the bill's provision for a state-of-the-art defense, currently available to manufacturers in only eight states, would undermine the legal doctrine of `` strict liability'' used in 47 states and favored by consumer interests. That doctrine shifts the focus of a liability trial from the manufacturer's alleged misconduct to the defective product itself, relieving the courts of establishing what a manufacturer knew or should have known about a product's defects.

 Former presidential candidates <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> McGovern </PERSON> and <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldwater </PERSON>, usually on opposite ends of the political spectrum, joined Tuesday in urging <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to recognize the `` national legitimacy'' of Arab Palestinians and turn over territory to them in exchange for peace. Their proposal differs from the plan unsuccessfully pursued by Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> in that it would bypass <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>, which controlled the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> for l9 years, and strongly implies _ but does not specifically recommend _ creation of a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> state. <PERSON> McGovern </PERSON>, the losing Democratic standard bearer in 1972, was explicit in an interview, however, that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> should deal with the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> with the purpose of establishing a Palestinian state on the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. Beside <PERSON> McGovern </PERSON> and <PERSON> Goldwater </PERSON>, who was the losing Republican presidential candidate in 1964, those endorsing the proposal were former Undersecretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ball </PERSON>, former <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Klutznick </PERSON>, and three former <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> government heads _ <PERSON> Garrett </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzgerald </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Anker </PERSON> <PERSON> Jorgensen </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Bruno </PERSON> <PERSON> Kreisky </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION>. `` We support the continued independence and security of the state of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>,'' the statement said. `` We equally affirm the right of self-determination and security for the Palestinian people. We believe that mutual recognition and good-faith negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians can achieve a just settlement ...'' <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> would yield all of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, which it has held since 1967, to form a homeland for the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> in return for the Arab world's acceptance. The negotiations, the statement said, should be `` based on mutual recognition of national legitimacy and the exchange of territory for peace. The bloody violence and loss of life in the disputed territory underscores the urgency of constructive negotiations.'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> returned last week from the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> where he was unable to persuade <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> to enter negotiations. <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>'s King <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> demanded assurances that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> would yield the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>, which <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> refused to provide. In ruling out <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> participation, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s organization, which has carried out a number of terrorist assaults on Israelis and Americans, must recognize <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right to exist first His plan called for including Palestinians in a joint delegation with <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION>. Asked about bypassing <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON>, <PERSON> McGovern </PERSON> said `` I think we've got to get around it. The government of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> has to negotiate with the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> has said it's willing to be part of an all-Arab delegation. That would be fine with me. It's a matter of the Palestinians determining who is to speak for them.'' <PERSON> McGovern </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> was the only organization capable of speaking for Arab Palestinians and the only one `` that could enforce what's agreed on.''

The religion that once numbered 6,000 members has dwindled to fewer than a dozen. `` I think she'll always be here in her spiritual presence and in memory,'' said <PERSON> Darryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, whose father is the historical director of the <ORGANIZATION> Canterbury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shaker </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Village </ORGANIZATION> and whose first baby clothes were made by <PERSON> Eldress </PERSON> <PERSON> Soule </PERSON>. `` The challenge for us will be to keep that living sense of presence alive and pass on the heritage.'' Because they were celibate, Shakers maintained their numbers through converts and orphans, like <PERSON> Eldress </PERSON> <PERSON> Soule </PERSON> who went to the Shaker community at <LOCATION> Sabbathday </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, at age 11 after her mother died. At 21, she decided to stay on and took her vows. About 150 people packed the tiny Dwelling House Chapel and more than 50 stood outside for the 90-minute funeral in temperatures that approached 90 degrees in cloudless sunshine. <PERSON> Eldress </PERSON> <PERSON> Bertha </PERSON> <PERSON> Lindsay </PERSON>, 90, and Sister <PERSON> Ethel </PERSON> <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON>, 92, who live at the village, wore traditional Shaker dress and sat side by side, standing to sing Shaker hymns during the service. Other Shakers from <LOCATION> Sabbathday </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION>, the only other surviving Shaker community, also attended. <PERSON> Eldress </PERSON> <PERSON> Soule </PERSON> was buried at a cemetery enclosed by stone and iron fences, where a single granite stone is marked `` Shakers.'' Village residents' names were listed in books and records, but they share the common gravestone in death as they shared all their possessions in life. Those who wished to `` give testimony'' about <PERSON> Eldress </PERSON> <PERSON> Soule </PERSON> described her as a woman who loved children, nature and her life in the village of white clapboard buildings atop a hill surrounded by fields. `` The day she died I went to all the places we used to spend time and she was there in every place,'' <PERSON> Darryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> said. `` She saw God in every flower.'' <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> described how he came to know <PERSON> Eldress </PERSON> <PERSON> Soule </PERSON> three years ago after visiting for a traditional Shaker dinner, offered when the village is open as a museum to visitors. `` Believe it or not, <PERSON> Eldress </PERSON> <PERSON> Soule </PERSON> last fall said she always wanted to learn how to shoot a gun,'' <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> said. He said he got a .22 - caliber rifle and she got a tin can, donned her bonnet and cape and they went behind her She wanted to put the can on a 100-year-old Shaker fence, <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> said. `` I said ` No, you might shoot the fence,''' he said. `` She said ` I'm not going to shoot the fence, I'm going to shoot the can.''' `` I'd like to report the Shakers are excellent marksmen. She hit two out of four shots dead center,'' <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON> said. `` I'm going to miss her.'' <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Morse </PERSON>, the Shakers' lawyer, also remembered <PERSON> Eldress </PERSON> <PERSON> Soule </PERSON>'s sense of humor and her courage. `` Here was a lady who stood fast for what she believed in and always did it with the most pleasant way about her,'' <PERSON> Morse </PERSON> said. The Shakers lived simply, farming and producing tools such as the clothespin and flat broom. They were pacifists and believed all people were equal. Originating in the 1770s in <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Shaking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Quakers </ORGANIZATION> grew under the leadership of `` Mother'' <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, who moved to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> in 1774 with eight followers. Formally named the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Believers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> in </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christ </ORGANIZATION>'s Second Coming, they gained their nickname from emotional trembling in their religious services.

<HEAD>Government Hurries to Ease Tax Burden on Independent Enterprises</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government is moving quickly to lower taxes for cooperative ventures before a new law enters force July 1, the official Soviet news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday. The new measure broadens the rights of the thousands of independent enterprises that are key to <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reform movement. The announcement was a victory for those supporting <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s efforts to reform the Soviet economy and to provide a better quality and selection of consumer goods and services Last month the Supreme Soviet, the nominal national parliament, passed a law ensuring that cooperatives, owned by their members rather than the state, can compete on an equal footing with state-run businesses. It allows cooperatives to earn hard currency, prohibits government interference in their business and bars the state from taking them over. But it would have left in place a new tax ladder set up by the <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> forcing cooperatives to pay the state up to 90 percent of profits. Supreme Soviet deputies called for a change, complaining that the taxes would strangle the cooperatives. A leading reform advocate, economist <PERSON> Nikolai </PERSON> <PERSON> Shmelev </PERSON>, had told a news conference rewriting the tax law might take as long as a year. But <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said government experts will have the new tax law ready in weeks. `` Significant changes are expected to be made to the decree,'' <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said. `` They say, in particular, that progressive taxes on co-ops will be reduced to 60 percent and even possibly 50 percent from the current 90.'' `` Members of the co-ops most needed by society, for example building ones, as well as cooperatives selling their products at state prices, will most likely be exempted from progressive taxation altogether.''

 Democrats are planning to use computers to tally some of the votes at the party's nominating convention next month, but officials say the high-tech addition wo n't upstage the traditional high point of the convention _ the state-by-state roll call. The party's convention committee is working out the bugs in an electronic voting system that will allow delegations, using small computers on the floor, to vote on the party platform and convention rules. Votes would be displayed on a big overhead screen behind the podium. `` But we will still do the roll call for the president and vice president in the traditional manner,'' said <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> <PERSON> Berry </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the committee that is planning the July 18-21 convention in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. The state-by-state roll call, in which the head of each delegation takes the floor to announce the state's votes, `` is a long-standing tradition,'' she said. `` It's something people expect and it adds excitement to the convention.'' Several other high-tech features are being explored by the convention committee, incuding the electronics to allow delegates to send messages to other delegates on the floor, computer to computer, she said. The committee also is talking to <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION>, which provides local phone service in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, about televising convention activities on closed-circuit, high-definition television monitors around the convention center and in nearby VIP and hospitality suites. High-definition TV, still in the experimental stage, is considered the next generation in television, delivering clearer, brighter images on a screen that is wider than conventional TV sets and with the sound quality of a compact-disc recording. <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> has found eight large-screen, Japanese-made monitors it can use at the convention but is having trouble finding more, said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> McCloskey </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> BellSouth </ORGANIZATION>, the parent corporation of <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION>. Few monitors are available because the Japanese, leaders in HDTV development, plan to cover the <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> Olympics in high definition for a country-wide demonstration in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> this summer, he said. <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> has put in a 1,063-mile fiber optic network to handle about 9,000 convention telephone lines that will be used by an estimated 16,000 reporters, editors and technicians and 14,000 delegates, party representatives and other convention participants.

 The judge who sentenced the <LOCATION> Sharpeville </LOCATION> Six to hang said Monday he would not reopen their murder trial, but he gave the convicts 35 days to appeal for clemency from President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> already has turned down such a request, despite international appeals that he spare the lives of the five black men and one woman convicted in the 1984 mob killing of a black town councilor. The campaign appeared to be resuming Monday. <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Kinnock </PERSON>, leader of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s opposition <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, asked <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s white authorities to stop the execution `` in the name of common humanity and for the sake of preventing violence. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said: `` We continue to appeal for a humanitarian resolution of the <LOCATION> Sharpeville </LOCATION> Six case whether it be clemency or the granting of a new trial. We will be making our views known to the South African government through diplomatic channels.'' Judge <PERSON> Willem </PERSON> <PERSON> Human </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Pretoria </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, who presided at the original trial in 1985, rejected an application by defense lawyers that the case be reopened to consider allegations that police coerced two state witnesses. Human said he had seen no affidavits from the witnesses saying their testimony was false and said that even if they lied, there was enough evidence for convictions. The councilor in the <LOCATION> Sharpeville </LOCATION> black township was stoned to death and burned during riots provoked by a rent increase. None of the six was proved guilty of physical involvement in the death of <PERSON> Khuzwayo </PERSON> <PERSON> Dlamini </PERSON>, but they were found guilty under the principle that they participated actively in the crowd that murdered him. The defendants are <PERSON> Mojalefa </PERSON> <PERSON> Sefatsa </PERSON>, <PERSON> Reid </PERSON> <PERSON> Mokoena </PERSON>, <PERSON> Oupa </PERSON> <PERSON> Diniso </PERSON>, <PERSON> Duma </PERSON> <PERSON> Khumalo </PERSON>, <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> Mokhesi </PERSON> and <PERSON> Theresa </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramashamola </PERSON>, the only woman on death row for what oppenents of the government call a politically related crime. Their execution originally was scheduled for March 17 and <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> resisted appeals for clemency from churches, human rights groups and governments, including the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. Judge Human granted a stay hours before the six were to hang, agreeing to hear arguments that the trial should be reopened because of the possibility that police coerced two prosecution witnesses to give false testimony. Defense lawyers told Human in court Monday they did not have affidavits from the witnesses. Human called their request for a new trial `` frivolous and absurd.'' He refused them permission to appeal and said they should have taken their request to <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>. He stayed the executions for 35 more days so the lawyers could take whatever further steps are possible. The lawyers said they would would petition P.J. <PERSON> Rabie </PERSON>, acting chief justice, for permission to take Human's decision to the <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> he heads. That court, like the president, already has refused to overturn Human's original decision and sentence. Several dozen friends, relatives and diplomats were in the courtroom Monday. <PERSON> Thewy </PERSON> did not react immediately to the reading of the decision, but some family members wept later when lawyer <PERSON> Prakesh </PERSON> <PERSON> Diar </PERSON> explained it to them in the corridor. Relatives then went to <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION> prison to visit the six convicts. <PERSON> Diar </PERSON> agreed with a reporter that, although he will appeal to the chief justice, the fate of the <LOCATION> Sharpeville </LOCATION> Six is in <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>'s hands. `` I'm afraid to say, yes, that is so,'' he said. `` I hope and I pray that the state president will reconsider his previous decision. This is a politically related case. -LRB- <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>'s decision -RRB- may be based on political considerations.'' He said he spoke with his clients last week and described them as `` hopeful, but not confident.'' Referring to the international campaign to save them, he said: `` Although they are in their cells alone, they are not alone spiritually. They know the world is with them.'' The government has contended the six have been unfairly portrayed abroad as innocent victims of an unjust law. Authorities say evidence at the trial proved each played an active part in the killing through such actions as making firebombs to burn <PERSON> Dlamini </PERSON>'s house and slapping a woman who pleaded for the councilor's life.

<HEAD>Long Island County Enacts 1st Law To Regulate Terminals</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By PAT MILTON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>HAUPPAUGE, N.Y. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The first law in the nation to regulate use of computer terminals in the workplace was enacted Tuesday when the <LOCATION> Suffolk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Legislature overrode the county executive's veto. `` It is a happy day for <LOCATION> Suffolk </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>'s workforce,'' said legislator <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, who introduced the bill. In six months, businesses with more than 20 visual display terminals will have to provide special treatment for workers who spend more than 26 hours a week in front of the computer screens: _ The workers must have 15-minute breaks or a new work assignment after three hours with a VDT _ The employer must pay 80 percent of the cost of annual eye exams and any eyeglasses that are needed In addition, any equipment purchased after next year must have such features as non-glare screens, adjustable desks and five-legged chairs. The bill was written in response to worker complaints of eyestrain, muscle aches and other ill effects from long-term VDT use. Subsequently, <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> researchers reported that a study found that women who used VDTs for more than 20 hours a week during the first three months of preganncy suffered twice the number of miscarriages of women who rarely used terminals. But the researchers said they could not determine whether the VDTs or some other factor such as job stress caused the increased rate. County Executive <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Halpin </PERSON> vetoed the <LOCATION> Suffolk </LOCATION> measure on Friday, saying it would drive businesses away from the eastern <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> county. `` The new law will cost <LOCATION> Suffolk </LOCATION> many good high tech jobs,'' he predicted after Tuesday's vote. The 18-member Legislature discussed the bill for about an hour before voting 13-5 _ one vote more than needed _ to override <PERSON> Halpin </PERSON>'s veto. `` The county executive heard what he wanted to hear from big money, big business and fear,'' said Legislator <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> <PERSON> Caracappa </PERSON>. `` Opposition to this bill was based on overreaction,'' charged legislator <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Blass </PERSON>. `` We've heard the doom and gloom from business in the past,'' when bottle-deposit and anti-smoking bills were enacted. <PERSON> Halpin </PERSON> said he would try `` to implement the law so it will have minimal impact on the business community.'' The County Health Department is responsible for enforcing the new law. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> LaRocca </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Long </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Island </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, a business group, predicted the loss of more than 3,000 jobs in pending expansion and relocation deals. Supporters of the bill were the <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employees </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, and various women's groups

<HEAD>Presidential Scholars Showing On Education Quiz Termed
`Respectable'</HEAD>

<BYLINE>AP Education Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 What do presidential scholars know? Apparently a good bit more than the typical 17-year-old. But a good many still were stumped by some questions on a federal education officials' quiz on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> history and literature. <PERSON> Chester </PERSON> <PERSON> Finn </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, the assistant secretary of education for research and improvement, said Tuesday that the Presidential Scholars who took the multiple-choice test answered an average of 86 percent of the questions correctly. That compared with a 48 percent score for 8,000 juniors who answered the same questions in 1986 as part of a National Assessment of Educational Progress test. <PERSON> Finn </PERSON>, who co-authored a book about the results called `` What Do Our 17-year-olds Know?'' said it was a respectable showing. But many of the Presidential Scholars _ some of the nation's top high school seniors being honored here this week in four days of ceremonies and seminars _ missed some questions that <PERSON> Finn </PERSON> clearly thought they should have known. Only 63 percent of the scholars picked `` Speak softly and carry a big stick'' as the phrase that characterized <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> foreign policy during the early 1900s. Only 32 percent of the 17-year-olds tested in 1986 got that right. The phrase is a quotation from President <PERSON> Theodore </PERSON> <PERSON> Roosevelt </PERSON>. Only 48 percent picked <PERSON> Eudora </PERSON> <PERSON> Welty </PERSON> and <PERSON> Flannery </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> as authors known for stories set in the South; the national average was 14 percent. Fifty percent correctly picked <PERSON> Jane </PERSON> <PERSON> Addams </PERSON> as the founder of settlement houses to help the urban poor; the national average was 41 percent. Fifty-one percent identified <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> as the author of `` Native Son,'' a novel of black life in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>; the national average was 32 percent. <PERSON> Finn </PERSON> said, `` A hundred and one of you had the courage to actually take this test. This of course skews the results since the 20 or so of you who ducked it undoubtedly would have done worse on it. You were not a representative sample even of yourselves.'' At a session hosted by the Education Department for the scholars, he called the 86 percent score `` pretty good,'' but not cause for any swelled heads. <PERSON> Finn </PERSON> outlined <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration critiques of American schools and why it favors merit pay for teachers and other policies to spur improvements. When <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kandara </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Winston-Salem </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, asked about the anxiety that teacher career ladder plans can cause, <PERSON> Finn </PERSON> replied, `` In most professions, competition is not considered a vice. Are you familiar with the Olympics? Indeed, are you familiar with Presidential Scholars?'' `` American kids in general just do n't go to school enough,'' said <PERSON> Finn </PERSON>, who said a teen magazine generated a flood of letters criticizing him for a recent article in which he advocated year-round schools. `` The most interesting about the letters was how many were utterly incoherent,'' said <PERSON> Finn </PERSON>. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>, a scholar from <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, asked how American universities achieve world eminence `` with students who are so far inferior?'' <PERSON> Finn </PERSON> replied that the best American research universities are second to none, but `` an awful lot of colleges are driven by the dynamics of keeping their classes full.''

 Three years after the fact, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s highest-ranking military official has apologized for the 1985 shooting death of an <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> officer inside <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday The apology was extended by Soviet Defense Minister <PERSON> Dmitri </PERSON> <PERSON> Yazov </PERSON> to <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> at a private meeting May 31 during the <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> summit, said <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Howard </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s chief spokesman. <PERSON> Yazov </PERSON> offered no new details or explanation for the March 24, 1985, shooting of Maj. <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nicholson </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> by a Soviet soldier, nor did he respond to previous <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> demands for financial compensation to <PERSON> Nicholson </PERSON>'s family, <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> said. Nonetheless, `` we feel we have received the appropriate apology from the Soviets, yes,'' the spokesman said. `` The request for, or the demand for, an apology, we feel, has been responded to appropriately by the minister.'' <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> quoted <PERSON> Yazov </PERSON> as saying: `` I express my regret over the incident and am sorry this occurred. This does not promote improved relations. Secretary <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> and I have agreed we will do all we can to prevent these kinds of incidents in the future.'' <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> also said the two men had agreed during their <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> talks on `` the need to come up with some sort of regime that will prevent these things from happening.'' `` The two sides agreed to come up with a list of recent such incidents, violations, whatever, and to meet again to try to work out a set of ground rules,'' <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> said. `` That's where it stands at the moment.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spokesman repeatedly described <PERSON> Yazov </PERSON>'s apology as appropriate or satisfactory, apparently trying to close out an affair that had been seized upon by <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>'s predecessor as a stark example of Soviet inhumanity. Former <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Caspar </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON>, much to the occasional chagrin of <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials, never stopped demanding an apology and compensation for <PERSON> Nicholson </PERSON>'s death even as overall East-West relations improved. <PERSON> Weinberger </PERSON> stepped down last November. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> disclosed the <PERSON> Yazov </PERSON> apology during a regular <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> briefing, the first to be held since <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> returned from an around-the-world trip that included stops in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>. The spokesman said he did not disclose the apology at the close of the summit meeting between President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> because no reporters asked about the matter. Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Roland </PERSON> <PERSON> Lajoie </PERSON>, who was <PERSON> Nicholson </PERSON>'s commanding officer at the time of his death, hailed <PERSON> Yazov </PERSON>'s apology as long-awaited vindication. `` It was a long time coming, but the Soviet military has made the right decision,'' <PERSON> Lajoie </PERSON> said in a statement Tuesday. `` Their apology vindicates the position that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government has constantly maintained on this tragic incident. I am personally very pleased to hear the news, but more importantly, the <PERSON> Nicholson </PERSON> family will be gratified at this development.'' <PERSON> Lajoie </PERSON> was a colonel at the time of <PERSON> Nicholson </PERSON>'s death. He is now a one-star general in charge of the new <ORGANIZATION> On-Site </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inspection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> that will oversee verification of the Intermediate-range Nuclear Forces Treaty. <PERSON> Nicholson </PERSON> was shot and killed by a Soviet army sentry more than three years ago while on what was supposed to be a routine surveillance mission inside <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. The 37-year-old <PERSON> Nicholson </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Redding </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, was a member of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liaison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mission </ORGANIZATION>, allowed under the terms of a 1947 treaty to keep tabs on Soviet military activities inside <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. On the day he died, <PERSON> Nicholson </PERSON> and a driver, Sgt. <PERSON> Jessie </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schatz </PERSON>, were trying to observe a Soviet tank shed. According to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> account, <PERSON> Nicholson </PERSON> was close to _ but not in _ a restricted area when a Soviet sentry suddenly opened fire without warning. The Pentagon has charged that <PERSON> Schatz </PERSON> was directly prevented from going to the wounded man with his first aid kit and that the major was left to die without medical attention. The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> also noted angrily at the time that Soviet military inspectors working inside <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> had never been threatened with being shot. The Russians previously had countered that <PERSON> Nicholson </PERSON> was improperly wearing a camouflaged uniform; had strayed into a restricted area, and ignored several shouted warnings before the sentry opened fire.

 Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> lashed out at Nicaraguan authorities on Tuesday, accusing them of reneging on promises to create democracy and of subjecting Contra negotiators to harassment and intimidation during talks last week. But <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, after a meeting with the <ORGANIZATION> Contra </ORGANIZATION> leadership, declined to say whether the failure of the peace negotiations between the leftist Sandinista government and the Contras means the administration will seek military aid for the rebels. Meanwhile, Nicaraguan Ambassador <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Tunnermann </PERSON> held the Contras responsible for collapse of the peace talks, contending they had made `` demands so outlandish and unacceptable'' that they knew in advance the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> negotiators would reject them. In a letter to <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Tunnermann </PERSON> said that on the last day of the talks, the Contras introduced `` an entirely new set of demands'' and insisted that the government accept all of them within two hours. `` They virtually presented my government with an ultimatum,'' <PERSON> Tunnermann </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, speaking with reporters, said that in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> last week, `` the resistance delegation was harassed, initimidated and subjected to continual abuse, treated virtually as prisoners, refused permission to meet with democratic political leaders and threatened with harm by Defense Minister <PERSON> Humberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> if they refused to sign an agreement.'' <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON>, a member of the Contra directorate, asked to elaborate on <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>'s allegation, said <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> at one point threatened to deny the rebel delegation permission to leave <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> if the talks broke down. `` About 20 minutes later, he -LRB- <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> -RRB- said that once the war started again, the bullets from the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> will not only be against our combatants from the mountains but against the people sitting across this table,'' <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, blaming the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> for the breakdown of the talks, said their actions have shown the world `` that their promises of democratization have no counterpart in concrete action. `` Their consistent and apparent goal has been to disarm and eliminate the resistance so that they can proceed to consolidate their rule in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Sultz </PERSON> said. `` Their kind of rule in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> will never be accepted as legitimate by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. We will stick with the resistance freedom fighters. Their cause of peace with freedom is the right cause.'' It was not clear what <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> meant when he raised questions about the legitimacy of the Sandinista government because the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has always been represented in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> by an ambassador since the start of the 1979 revolution. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> met with <PERSON> Cesar </PERSON> and two other members of the Contra directorate on Tuesday along with the rebels' military commander, Col. <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Bermudez </PERSON>, as part of an assessment of future options. The Contra leaders met into the dinner hour at the White House with national security adviser <PERSON> Colin </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>. There was no immediate indication of what transpired in that meeting. Rep. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION>, has recommended a $ 105 million package of military and humanitarian aid for the Contras, and <LOCATION> Contra </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Adolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Calero </PERSON> has indicated support for that proposal. The Contras have received no military aid since Feb. 29. But <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has approved assistance for the purchase of food, shelter, medical supplies and clothing. The administration's last request for military aid was rejected by the House on Feb. 3. The rebels will confer Wednesday with members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> about possible future steps. House Republican leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> said <PERSON> Contra </PERSON> aid was discussed at a meeting of <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> congressional leaders with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> on Tuesday, but no decisions were reached. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> said he expects a push for renewal of humanitarian aid. Asked about the prospect of military aid, he said, `` I do n't think, quite frankly, there has been the kind of dramatic movement either way that would indicate we would change any votes in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>.''

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appropriations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> voted Tuesday to let the next president decide whether to fund construction of a space station. Under the bill approved by the committee, $ 387 million would be available for research and development between Oct. 1, when the next fiscal year begins, and April 15, when the next president would have to decide whether to continue with the space station. Another $ 65.4 million would be held in an account, and should the president decide not to proceed further, those funds would be used to shut down the program. Additionally, $ 450 million would be held through April 15. If the new president decided to continue with the program, the money would go to the space station. If he decided against the space station, $ 150 million would be transferred to <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flight </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. The remaining $ 300 million would be rescinded. Under the bill, the new president would have to let <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> know between Feb. 1 and April 15 of his intentions to continue with the space station. `` If it's -LRB- Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, it could be the end of the space station,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> DeLay </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Texas </LOCATION>. `` The guy is a northern liberal. This is set up to pit domestic spending against defense spending ... DeLay, whose Houston-area district borders <ORGANIZATION> Johnson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, said about half of the station would be built in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. `` The Russians have already gotten their space station up,'' he said. `` They're going to beat us on technology and industrial development through a space station. The future is right there and we're way behind.'' He said construction of the space station could begin next year if it stays on schedule. The original bill, before it was amended Tuesday, called for a $ 902 million appropriation, which officials said was just enough to keep the program on schedule. The space station is planned to be in orbit around <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> and occupied by astronauts at the end of 1996. A year before that it would be available for periodic visits by astronauts.

<TEXT>
 An Arab-American deported from <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> said Tuesday that he would consider converting to <ORGANIZATION> Judaism </ORGANIZATION>, if necessary, to return to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> <PERSON> Awad </PERSON>, an advocate of non-violent <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> resistance, was deported Monday by the Israeli government, which accused him of subversion. <PERSON> Awad </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizen who was born in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> and returned there in 1983, said he might convert from Christianity to <ORGANIZATION> Judaism </ORGANIZATION> and seek re-entry under <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s Law of the Return `` if everything -LRB- else -RRB- failed.'' `` It's going to take a lot of guts to do it,'' <PERSON> Awad </PERSON> said at a news conference. `` Maybe I have to do it.'' `` I am here, but not by choice,'' he said. `` I was deported just because I am a Christian. If I were a Jew, I would not be deported.'' Under the Law of the Return, any Jew can enter <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. But the privilege is not absolute; gangster <PERSON> Meyer </PERSON> <PERSON> Lansky </PERSON>, for example, sought Israeli citizenship under the law in 1970, but was forced to leave in 1972 following allegations of his continued involvement in organized crime. Pressed on the subject of conversion, <PERSON> Awad </PERSON> said, `` I'll tell -LRB- a rabbi -RRB- frankly ... it's not my belief. It's a political statement that I'm persecuted because I'm a Christian.'' Leaders of reform Judaism, meanwhile, issued a letter saying that `` extraneous motivations, political motivations, are not sufficient reason'' for conversion. `` No one can rule out the possibility of a sincere conversion in anybody's case, but this must be proved at the end of a long period of instruction,'' said a letter sent to 1,500 Reform rabbis in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. But <PERSON> Awad </PERSON> said he would first pursue other avenues to return to <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, including appealing to international public opinion. He said he planned meetings with officials at the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. In ordering <PERSON> Awad </PERSON> deported, <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> alleged that he played a key role in this year's Arab uprising in the occupied territories. But <PERSON> Awad </PERSON> disclaimed any overriding influence among Palestinians, saying `` <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>, he's the one who made me a hero.'' He defended his support of the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, but said he did not support all the organization's actions or policies `` I condemn violence from the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION>, from Israelis, from everybody,'' he said. Awad denied inciting violence against <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> but has supported the uprising in the territories <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> captured in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. Some tactics he has long advocated, such as tax boycotts and commercial strikes, were adopted by leaders of the uprising. Awad is the 21st Arab to be expelled by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> since the Dec. 8 start of the Palestinian uprising in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. His expulsion was protested by the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. Awad was deported on the grounds that his three-month tourist visa issued last August had expired. The Israelis refused to extend the visa, and the <ORGANIZATION> Israeli </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> last week rejected <PERSON> Awad </PERSON>'s appeal to stay <PERSON> Awad </PERSON>, who lived in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for 13 years before returning to <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> in 1983, is the founder of the Palestinian Center for the Study of Non-Violence in that city. He has lectured on civil disobedience, counseled teachers against corporal punishment and planted olive trees in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> villages to underscore the Arabs' claim to the land. He lived in <LOCATION> Wapakoneta </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, where he still owns a home. His wife, <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Nye </PERSON>, said she soon will be going to <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> to teach.

<TEXT>
 The army ordered <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> schools closed for two days, trying to head off student protests during a general strike called for Wednesday by underground leaders of the 6-month-old Palestinian rebellion. Schools in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> were closed for four months and students held violent demonstrations after high schools reopened this week. The two-day closing Wednesday and Thursday was intended as a warning to students that they may be shut again if violence continues. New army figures said dozens of <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers have been convicted of or charged with excessive use of force and other violations of regulations since the uprising began Dec. 8 in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. The figures also showed the number of Arabs detained without charges, which permits them to be held for up to six months, increasing by one-fifth since May, to 2,500. Most are young activists. Civil rights workers criticized <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Rabin </PERSON>'s statement to the Cabinet this week that <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> civilians who see Arabs holding firebombs would be allowed to shoot them `` This is giving the green light for shooting and killing without justification,'' lawyer <PERSON> Amnon </PERSON> <PERSON> Zichroni </PERSON> said. `` This will lead to counterattacks from Palestinians. It's a vicious cycle without end.'' At least 207 Palestinieguards our freedoms and underpins the development of the West.'' `` The prospects for a lasting peace require us to prevent any weakening of our <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> solidarity, to refrain from any actions of unilateral disarmament,'' he said. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Mita </PERSON> said later at a news conference that a disagreement over <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> policy was aired during his talks with administration officials. Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> is trying to arrange negotiations between <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and a delegation of <LOCATION> Jordanians </LOCATION> and Palestinians. He has ruled out participation by the <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> unless it accepts <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s right to exist, as well as creation of a Palestinian state. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Mita </PERSON> said he told the Americans that <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> continues to believe the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> is the legitimate representative of the Palestinian people. One of the topics expected to arise at the <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> summit is the extent to which the industrialized democracies should help <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> European nations solve their economic problems. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Mita </PERSON> said he and the president agreed that massive aid for these countries should be withheld as long as their economies are predominantly state-managed. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Mita </PERSON> planned to meet on Wednesday with members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> before making a private visit to Bar Harbor, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 A monk from <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION> brought petitions here Tuesday from nearly 2 million Italians seeking commutation of the death penalty given to a teen-ager for the murder and robbery of a Bible teacher. The Rev. <PERSON> Vito </PERSON> <PERSON> Bracone </PERSON> said he was disappointed that Gov. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Orr </PERSON>, who had previous engagements, did not accept the petitions in person. Instead, <PERSON> Bracone </PERSON> met with an aide to the governor and with the convicted murderer, <PERSON> Paula </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>, 18. The petition drive in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> began in November 1986 to win clemency for <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>, of <PERSON> Gary </PERSON>, who was sentenced to die in <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>'s electric chair for a 1985 robbery and stabbing Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> announced last September that he, too, would like to see <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> granted clemency. <PERSON> Orr </PERSON>, leaving his office to fulfill two speaking engagements, said <PERSON> Bracone </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> members accompanying the Franciscan monk had n't called to ask for a meeting. If they had, <PERSON> Orr </PERSON> said he's not sure he would have met with <PERSON> Bracone </PERSON> because <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>'s appeal is pending. `` The issue is still before the judiciary,'' he said. `` Until they've completed their work, I think it would be inappropriate for me to get involved.'' The governor has the authority to commute a sentence at any time. But <PERSON> Orr </PERSON> has not yet received a direct commutation request from <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>'s lawyers, who still have an appeal pending before the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. Bracone, at a news conference outside the <ORGANIZATION> Statehouse </ORGANIZATION>, said he only wanted a dialogue with the governor. `` I do n't see why we can not talk. I do n't want to put any pressure on him,'' said <PERSON> Bracone </PERSON>. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sutherlin </PERSON>, a local <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said the group might try later to arrange to present the petitions to <PERSON> Orr </PERSON>. He also pledged that the organization would try during the 1989 <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> to have the death penalty repealed. <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> believes the death penalty is a human rights violation. <PERSON> Orr </PERSON> said he believes the death penalty still has broad public support in <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>. During the 1987 legislative session, <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> and other groups including the <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION> lobbied successfully for a bill to raise to 16 from 10 the minimum age of a person who could be sentenced to death. The new law does not affect <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>, who was 15 at the time of the 1985 stabbing and robbery of <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pelke </PERSON>, 78, of <PERSON> Gary </PERSON>. Three other teen-agers were also convicted of related crimes in the slaying, but none of the others was sentenced to die. Mrs. <PERSON> Pelke </PERSON>'s grandson, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Pelke </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Portage </LOCATION>, has called for <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> to be granted clemency. He accompanied Bracone to the Statehouse Tuesday. Bracone and the Rev. <PERSON> Justin </PERSON> <PERSON> Belitz </PERSON>, a Franciscan priest from <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION>, met with <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> at the <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> Women's Prison in <LOCATION> Indianapolis </LOCATION>. She told them she is taking college-level correspondence courses from a Bible college in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wayne </LOCATION> and soon will take courses from <ORGANIZATION> Indiana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> said she would like eventually to study psychology and work with children.

<TEXT>
 Thousands of people joined a march in the <LOCATION> Latvian </LOCATION> capital of <LOCATION> Riga </LOCATION> Tuesday in memory of Latvians deported from the republic when it was occupied by Soviet forces before and after World War II, <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported. The official Soviet news agency said the march was sanctioned by Soviet officials and `` many thousands'' of people participated. It reported Latvian historian <PERSON> Jan </PERSON> <PERSON> Riekstins </PERSON> addressed a rally and quoted him as saying: `` We justifiably condemn the policy of cruelty.'' Last year a similar demonstration was allowed by Soviet authorities without interference and <LOCATION> Latvian </LOCATION> activists said 5,000 people took part. The fact that this year's march was officially sanctioned appeared linked to Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s policy of more open reporting of the wrongs conducted under the dictatorship of <PERSON> Josef </PERSON> <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>, who died in 1953. <LOCATION> Latvian </LOCATION> activists had said Tuesday's demonstration was called `` to prevent the return of Stalinist and neo-Stalinist crimes against the people and in the further unwavering forward course of <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s restructuring,'' according to <PERSON> Ojars </PERSON> <PERSON> Kalnins </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> of Free Latvians in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> quoted <LOCATION> Riga </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Rudiks </PERSON> as saying the government of the republic had `` approved the initiative of young people to build in <LOCATION> Riga </LOCATION> a monument to victims of <PERSON> Stalin </PERSON>'s personality cult.'' Official Soviet historians say 31,000 people were deported from <LOCATION> Lativa </LOCATION> after it was occupied by the Soviet army in 1940 and in 1949. The last occupation came after <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> had been defeated and the Soviets were in the process of annexing <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION> and the neighboring <LOCATION> Baltic </LOCATION> republics of <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> had seized the republics during the war. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said many of the deportation victims were Nazi sympathizers. `` Apart from those who were deservedly punished for acts of political sabotage, collaboration with fascists, banditism and espionage, the deportees also included innocent people,'' the agency said. It had harsh words for one of the march organizers, <PERSON> Edmund </PERSON> <PERSON> Cirvilis </PERSON>, calling him `` a former <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> soldier who was sent to <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION> on a terrorist mission in 1945.'' Repeated attempts to reach <LOCATION> Latvian </LOCATION> activists in <LOCATION> Riga </LOCATION> by telephone were unsuccessful. There was no word on a demonstration planned Tuesday in <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>. Various reports say 36,000 Lithuanians were deported in 1941 and 200,000 in 1948. Last month, Soviet police broke up a demonstration by 5,000 Lithuanians marking the anniversary of the 1949 deportations, according to <LOCATION> Lithuanian </LOCATION> activists. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has never officially recognized the Soviet claim to the Baltic republics.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A senior <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> official resigned Tuesday in a dispute over whether the party should modify its controversial pledge to abandon <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s nuclear weapons and shut down <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> nuclear bases. Legislator <PERSON> Denzil </PERSON> <PERSON> Davies </PERSON>, the party's parliamentary spokesman on defense, said the `` last straw'' was a recent statement by party leader <PERSON> Neil </PERSON> <PERSON> Kinnock </PERSON> that <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION>'s unilateral nuclear disarmament policy is outmoded. `` I am fed up with being humiliated by Mr. <PERSON> Kinnock </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Davies </PERSON>, 49. `` He never consults me on anything ... I can not get up in the House of Commons and make a speech when Mr. <PERSON> Kinnock </PERSON> says all sorts of things all over the place, one thing one day and another the next _ and he is supposed to be the future prime minister.'' <PERSON> Kinnock </PERSON> said he was amazed and sad that <PERSON> Davies </PERSON>, a fellow Welshman and longtime senior figure in the opposition party, had quit. <PERSON> Kinnock </PERSON> later named <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON>, a legislator since 1970, to replace <PERSON> Davies </PERSON>. <PERSON> Davies </PERSON>' resignation, announced in statement, highlighted a widening split as <PERSON> Kinnock </PERSON> pushes Labor back toward the center in what he sees as the socialists' only hope of ousting Conservative Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> at the next election. It must be held by 1992. <PERSON> Kinnock </PERSON>, 46, a lifelong anti-nuclear campaigner, angered <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> left-wingers when he said in a June 5 television interview there was `` no need now for something-for-nothing unilateralism'' because the superpowers had broken the impasse by singing an accord scrapping intermediate-range nuclear missiles. `` We would be complete fools, whatever our politics, to ignore the scope and scale of the change and the opportunities and responsibilities that go with trying to be part of that change,'' <PERSON> Kinnock </PERSON> said of U.S.-Soviet agreements. <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Benn </PERSON>, an ex-Cabinet minister and leading leftist who will challenge <PERSON> Kinnock </PERSON> for the leadership at the party conference in the fall, said <PERSON> Davies </PERSON>' resignation confirmed `` there is unhappiness across the whole party about the way things are going.'' The Conservatives were jubilant at the renewed public outbreak of fighting among the Laborites over the anti-nuclear policy, which polls show is a major vote-loser. `` The job of defense spokesman in today's <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> is an impossible one,'' commented Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s armed forces minister <PERSON> Ian </PERSON> <PERSON> Stewart </PERSON>. `` The choice is between a policy of unilateral disarmament, which makes Labor unelectable, or a policy of realism, which is unacceptable to large sections of the <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said. <PERSON> Kinnock </PERSON> has denied dumping the non-nuclear pledge, which the party first adopted as official policy in 1982, three years after losing power to Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>. But the June 5 interview was his strongest indication that a <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> government would use <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s nuclear weapons as a bargaining chip in arms control talks with the Soviets, rather than simply scrap them on principle The current policy calls also for closing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> nuclear bases in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>. In the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commons </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday, Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> reiterated her opposition to including Trident missiles in arms control talks, noting it was the equivalent of three percent of the Soviet arsenal. `` There is no point ... in giving up 100 percent of our Trident for the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> giving up 3 percent of her strategic weapons,'' she said. Polls indicate that while a majority of Britons oppose having <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> nuclear weapons in this country, many also believe <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> should remain a nuclear power.

 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> promised on Tuesday to replace the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's <ORGANIZATION> Strategic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Initiative </ORGANIZATION> with a `` Conventional Defense Initiative'' to help defend <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> against Soviet attack. The all-but-certain Democratic presidential nominee, in a major defense and foreign policy speech, also said the federal budget situation means it is time `` to make tough choices on defense.'' He denied that he was tipping his hand to the Soviets by announcing opposition to the MX and Midgetman missiles. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> declared a strong commitment to <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> and outlined a step-by-step plan for reducing the risk of war in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. In a reference to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and its allies, he said that to eliminate the possibility of a surprise attack `` we have to have greater reductions from the side with the most forces, the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact.'' Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, for his part, denounced <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as `` wrong, wrong'' for opposing SDI and the MX missile. `` He's wrong twice,'' the vice president told reporters in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. On another foreign policy subject, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> appeared uncomfortable with his party's plan to label <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> a terrorist state in its platform, as his own representatives agreed at a platform drafting session Sunday in <LOCATION> Mackinac </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION> `` I tend to resist labels generally because I do n't know exactly what they mean,'' said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. But <PERSON> Madeleine </PERSON> <PERSON> Albright </PERSON>, his foreign policy adviser, said later that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was `` very comfortable'' with the evolving platform, and `` there is absolutely no distancing himself from what was said'' at the drafting session. In his speech at the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> before a pro-NATO group called the <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said, `` We've got to be very tough on <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. Constructive engagement's a failure. ... <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> is not only engaging in blatant racism against its own people and in terrorist acts; it's committing naked military agression against its neighbors all over southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> also said that if President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> can achieve an agreement with the Soviets on long-range missiles in the closing months of 1988, `` I strongly urge the administration to go for it and I hope they do.'' He declared his commitment to `` a <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> so strong and so united that no nation will be tempted to begin a war against us.'' But he also said the <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> allies must bear a greater share of the common defense burden. `` <ORGANIZATION> NATO </ORGANIZATION> has worked for 40 years. It can work for 40 more _ if our allies do their share and if we stop trying to go it alone as we have done too often during the past seven years,'' he said. `` We all know that the defense budget is n't going to increase in real terms, unless an emergency arises, no matter who the next president is, he said. `` The time has come to make tough choices on defense.'' `` We do n't need SDI; we need <ORGANIZATION> CDI </ORGANIZATION>, the Conventional Defense Initiative begun by leaders in the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to apply advanced technology to the challenge of fighting and winning a conventional war,'' he said. The Strategic Defense Initiative is the administration's proposed space-based missile-defense system, still in the research stage. `` We do n't need MX missiles running around on railroad cars. We need an anti-tank weapon that can stop Soviet tanks.'' Asked why he would announce in advance that he opposes such mobile weapons as the MX and Midgetman missiles, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> denied that he was giving the Soviets an advantage at the bargaining table. He said modernizing the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> nuclear arsenal was `` an open question.'' Later Tuesday, after returning to <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> denounced <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> for allowing <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> budget cuts that he said have hampered the war on drugs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> held a meeting with Rep. <PERSON> Gerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Studds </PERSON>, D-Mass., and leaders of a regional drug taks force aboard the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> cutter Vigilant, and he said the commander told him the ship would remain at the docks for the next several months because of the cuts `` This is our first line of defense,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` It does n't make any sense. ... We need them.'' In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, he called for persuading the Soviets `` to withdraw some of their advanced armored equipment from <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and to withdraw bridging equipment from their forward-based divisions.'' He also called for talks `` to eliminate the threat of chemical warfare not only in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, but throughout the world.'' `` But while we negotiate, we must strengthen the alliance as well, beginning with our conventional forces,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` The commanders of our armed forces have repeatedly warned us of the dangers we face. Maintenance backlogs are growing. We have serious shortfalls in airlift and sealift, in spare parts and ammunition,'' he said.

<HEAD>House Panel Chairman Says Bill To Give Diesel Fuel Tax Relief To
Farmers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM LUTHER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Tax Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday his panel will begin writing a tax bill next week that will include relief for farmers from the tax on diesel fuel. `` I'm encouraged,'' the chairman, Rep. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ill </LOCATION>., said after separate meetings with Democrats and Republicans on his panel The bill likely would be the only tax legislation that has a chance of passing <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> this year. The main purpose of the bill would be correcting errors in the 1986 tax overhaul, but the committee could attach to the bill any of dozens of other tax provisions that have been proposed. However, the number of successful amendments is likely to be small this year because of budget agreements requiring that any provision cutting taxes be offset by another that raises revenues. Most such amendments usually are added when a tax bill goes through the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. But <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON> said Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, is `` encouraged that he can hold a very well disciplined bill together on the floor of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>'' _ that is, that he could protect it against serious amendment. `` That's encouraging to me,'' <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON> told reporters. <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON> acknowledged that any bill will include a popular provision to excuse farmers and state and local governments from a new law requiring them to pay taxes on their purchases of diesel fuel and then apply to the treasury for a rebate. The <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> already has voted to repeal the requirement. The chairman said there is considerable support on his committee for extending some tax breaks that have expired or are scheduled to end later this year. These include a tax exemption for revenue bonds that help first-time homebuyers; a credit for increased research and development, and a tax credit that encourages employers to hire the poor. Because of budget restrictions, <PERSON> Rostenkowski </PERSON> said, any extension of expiring provisions likely would be limited to one or two years. The chairman indicated there may not be enough support on the committee to toughen the tax on unrelated business income of organizations that generally are tax-exempt. Some lawmakers, striving to help small business against unfair competition, have called for taxation of such income, including that from universities' sale of computers and non-profit hospitals' newstands. Any tax bill that is debated this year is likely to face amendment by lawmakers who want to reduce the tax on capital gains, which are profits from the sale of stocks, land and other assets. This issue is complicated by the fact that advocates of a reduction _ including Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> _ contend such a move would increase tax collections by encouraging investment. Opponents deny it. Another hot issue is a `` taxpayer bill of rights,'' aimed at curbing alleged excesses of the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. The Finance Committee has approved a version but <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> members have been cool to the idea.

<HEAD>Senate Approves Army Nurse Statue for Vietnam Memorial</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TIM AHERN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday easily approved a bill authorizing a bronze statue of an Army nurse at the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> Veterans Memorial to honor the women who were part of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s longest war The bill was passed, 96-1, and sent to the House. Sponsored by Sen. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Durenberger </PERSON>, R-Minn., the measure had 75 co-sponsors and was endorsed by the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> The statue would be added to the 2.2 acre <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> Veterans Memorial, located on the Mall near the Lincoln Memorial. The memorial, built with $ 11 million in private funds, was opened in 1982 and has become one of the city's most visited monuments. Its polished black granite walls bear the names of the more than 58,000 <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> war dead, including eight uniformed nurses. <PERSON> Durenberger </PERSON> told his colleagues Tuesday the statue would be `` an appropriate and long overdue symbol of this nation's gratitude for the sacrifices and contributions of the 10,000 women who served in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>.'' Sen. <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Bumpers </PERSON>, D-Ark., called the new statue `` altogether appropriate'' to honor the women who took part in the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> war The opposition vote was cast by Sen. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON>, R-Wash., who also opposed the measure last month when it was approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Evans </PERSON> said then that his opposition was based on his belief that another statue would destroy the artistic integrity of the Vietnam Memorial. The female statue also was opposed by the <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capitol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Planning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, whose members argued the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> memorial was already complete and no new statues should be added. <PERSON> Maya </PERSON> <PERSON> Lin </PERSON>, the architect who designed the memorial, also opposed the addition of the female statue. In 1984, two years after the original memorial was finished, a statue of three infantrymen and an American flag were added near the end of one of the two walls which comprise the memorial. <PERSON> Durenberger </PERSON> said backers of the bill want to halt the addition of any more statutes to the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> monument. The bill includes a provision noting that `` after the addition of the -LRB- female -RRB- statue, the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> Veterans Memorial will be complete and no other additions to the site will be authorized or undertaken.''

<HEAD>Firefighters Continue Battling Wildfires in New Mexico</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Firefighters contained a wildfire that scorched nearly 500 acres Tuesday and battled to control several smaller fires sparked by lightning in southwestern <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> in recent days. The biggest fire burned at least 475 acres of grass and woodland, including pinon, juniper and ponderosa pine trees, on <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Land </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> land, officials said. The blaze, located on <LOCATION> Pelona </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> about 110 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Albuquerque </LOCATION>, was contained after about 175 firefighters cut a fire line with hand tools, said <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunton </PERSON>, state fire management officer for the <ORGANIZATION> BLM </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fe </LOCATION>. The blaze, which was first reported Saturday afternoon, was one of at least 25 reported since Friday, when a storm moved through the area. Many of the fires were small and did not burn long, said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Ewan </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. All were triggered by lightning, he said. <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Polasky </PERSON>, operations bureau chief for the state <ORGANIZATION> Forestry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Division </ORGANIZATION>, said a 70-acre fire on <PERSON> Luera </PERSON> Peak about 60 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Socorro </LOCATION> was expected to be controlled, or effectively extinguished, by Tuesday evening. The fire's spread was contained Monday. The fire started Saturday and burned ponderosa pine trees on <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> and private land. Elsewhere, a fire burned about 30 acres at <ORGANIZATION> Shaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canyon </ORGANIZATION>, between the <LOCATION> Pelona </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Luera </PERSON> Peak blazes, and another fire in <LOCATION> Whitewater </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canyon </LOCATION> in the <ORGANIZATION> Gila </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> blackened at least 15 acres, according to <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Zapata </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> relief dispatcher in <LOCATION> Silver </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. More than 50 firefighters battled the two blazes. Crews also fought two smaller fires covering about 2 acres each in the <LOCATION> Gila </LOCATION> forest near the <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> border, <PERSON> Zapata </PERSON> said. In addition, firefighters monitored four small fires covering less than one-tenth of an acre each in the <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> in south-central <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> public information officer.

<HEAD>World's Rice Production Heading Up</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The world's output of rice is headed up, led by a sharply expanded acreage in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday. If indicated plantings are borne out and yields are in line with past trends, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> rice production could be around 157 million hundredweight this year, up 23 percent from 1987, the department's <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said Assuming a return to normal weather in <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, foreign production could rise 7 percent in 1988-89, the agency said. In that case, global rice consumption would be expected to increase substantially following last year's decline, the first since 1971-72. `` Global trade probably will rise in 1988-89 as exportable supplies become more plentiful,'' the report said. `` While the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> stands to benefit from the growth in consumption and trade, competition for world markets in 1989 may intensify.''

<HEAD>Ashland to Appeal $70 Million Award to Two Former Vice Presidents</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Ashland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> says it will appeal a nearly $ 70 million award to two former vice presidents who claimed they were illegally fired for refusing to bribe foreign officials or cover up such bribes. A <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> jury Friday awarded <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> McKay </PERSON> $ 44,594,936 and <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> $ 24,980,431. <ORGANIZATION> Ashland </ORGANIZATION>, in a prepared statement, said it was `` very disappointed by the verdict,'' which it said was not supported by the evidence, and planned to appeal. The company maintained throughout the trial that payments to secure Arab oil during the 1970s and 1980s went to men of influence who were not government officials.

<HEAD>Ireland To Appeal Failed Extradition Effort</HEAD>
<DATELINE>DUBLIN, Ireland (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The government said Tuesday it will appeal an Irish court's release of a man wanted in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> on bombing charges. The ruling struck a blow to the new British-Irish extradition agreement. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> blamed Irish officials for losing the extradition case and said the two governments were holding `` urgent consultations.'' It was <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s first extradition attempt under the agreement signed Dec. 1 <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> McVeigh </PERSON>, 37, was freed Monday after a district court ruled the Irish government had not properly established his identity and said <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> police failed to produce witnesses that could identify the suspect. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> sought his extradition to face charges in connection with explosions between 1981 and 1983 in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> that killed two people outside <ORGANIZATION> Chelsea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barracks </ORGANIZATION> and a bomb disposal expert in <LOCATION> Oxford </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION>. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commons </ORGANIZATION>: `` The Crown Prosecution Service have done everything they could. ... They expressly asked whether further evidence from the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kingdom </LOCATION> on identification was needed and was told it was not.'' Irish Justice Minister <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Murray </PERSON>, addressing the <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION>, said the government was `` very deeply concerned'' by the case and will appeal to the High Court. He said <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> officials had told Irish authorities that no British police officer was `` in a position to make a personal identification of <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> McVeigh </PERSON> as the person concerned in the alleged offense.'' But he said the British officials were told further evidence of identification was not required because the information given to the court to identify the suspect as <PERSON> McVeigh </PERSON> was in accordance with established norms. <PERSON> McVeigh </PERSON>, from <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, was arrested May 18 as he left <LOCATION> Portlaoise </LOCATION> prison outside <LOCATION> Dublin </LOCATION> after serving five years of a seven-year sentence for arms offenses linked to the <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>, outlawed in both <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. <PERSON> McVeigh </PERSON> was seized only days after the British and <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> governments settled legal differences that had prevented any extradition efforts this year under the new pact. <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> agreed to make positive identification a chief factor in extradition. The mainly Roman Catholic <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> is fighting to unite <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> province where Protestants outnumber Catholics 3-2, with the predomidnantly <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>.

 Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> declared in a speech on defense Tuesday that `` we do n't need SDI,'' while Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> retorted that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is `` wrong, wrong'' for opposing the Strategic Defense Initiative and the MX missile. `` He's wrong twice,'' the vice president told reporters in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> concentrated on education, proposing a new $ 500 million program to reward schools that improve their performance in educating disadvantaged children. Meanwhile, the <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> lawyer in charge of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' search for a running mate conferred with Democratic congressional and party leaders, and a new poll indicated the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor still holds a big lead over <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as the summer conventions near. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> to address the nation's mayors, continued to insist he has earned the right to consideration for the vice presidency, though he did n't say he would accept it if offered. Not only did he do well in the Democratic primaries, he said, but `` I have an expertise in third world relations that the nation needs.'' He added, `` The black constituency has earned the consideration.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, in a speech to the <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, called for a shift in emphasis to conventional forces as the key to defense of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and said that if President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> can reach an agreement with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> on long-range missiles `` I strongly urge the administration to go for it.'' Education was the topic for the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> vice president, who called for a $ 500 million program to reward schools that come up with innovative programs to help disadvantaged students. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign spokesman <PERSON> Leslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Dach </PERSON> said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Brountas </PERSON>, a close friend and adviser to the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor, was conferrring with leading Democrats in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and `` asking them for their thoughts'' on the vice presidential selection process. <PERSON> Dach </PERSON> said <PERSON> Brountas </PERSON> would meet with <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> leaders as well as other key elected and party officials. Then, the spokesman said, the plan is for <LOCATION> Brountas </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> to `` get together and have a conversation about what they've both heard about names and ideas on how to go forward and then go on from there.'' <PERSON> Dach </PERSON> refused to identify people with whom <PERSON> Brountas </PERSON> was meeting. An aide to Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, one of the people mentioned most often as a potential <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> running mate, said <PERSON> Brountas </PERSON> had asked the senator for a meeting. <PERSON> Brountas </PERSON> was also to meet with Sen. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>. Also Tuesday, a new Gallup poll found 52 percent support for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and 38 percent for <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. The same poll a month ago gave <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> a 54-38 lead. Two other recent polls had single-digit leads for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, 49-44 in a <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> poll conducted June 1-6 and 45-39 in a <LOCATION> USA </LOCATION> Today-CNN poll June 7-9. The newest poll was conducted by Gallup for the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> television stations <ORGANIZATION> WEEI </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> WCVB </ORGANIZATION> June 10-12 among 1,005 registered voters. It had a margin of sampling error of four percentage points. Sen. <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, who dropped out of the Democratic presidential race after the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> primary, planned to endorse <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> on Thursday in <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, as the governor opened a Southern campaign swing. <PERSON> Gore </PERSON>, whose name also is on many observers' vice presidential lists, planned to fly to <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> on Wednesday and then go to <LOCATION> Tennesse </LOCATION> with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. Before going to <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> also had a meeting scheduled in his <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> office with <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spoke to a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> luncheon honoring 139 Presidential Scholars, some of the nation's top high school seniors. `` I believe the best thing we can do is invest in our young people,'' said the vice president. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> called for rewarding schools `` that significantly improve their performance'' serving disadvantaged students. `` Let the states determine the criteria for improvement,'' he said. `` Each school meeting the criteria would be recognized as a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Merit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>.'' The vice president said such schools would receive federal grants averaging $ 100,000. `` Each winning school could use the money as it pleased _ for lab equipment, library books or rewards for teachers and principals,'' he said. Speaking to the <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> meeting at the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said, `` We all know that the defense budget is n't going to increase in real terms unless an emergency arises, no matter who the next president is. ... The time has come to make tough choices on defense.'' `` We do n't need MX missiles running around on railroad cars. We need an anti-tank weapon that can stop Soviet tanks,'' he said. Referring to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s proposal for a space-based missile defense system, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said, `` We do n't need SDI; we need <ORGANIZATION> CDI </ORGANIZATION>, the Conventional Defense Initiative begun by leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to apply advanced technology to the challenge of fighting and winning a conventional war.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> also said he did not believe the recently approved treaty to remove <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Soviet medium-range missiles from <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> meant a lessening of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> commitment to defense of the continent. `` I do n't buy that at all,'' he said. `` Our commitment to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> goes far beyond a few hundred missiles.'' But he also called for <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> allies to pay a greater share of the burden of maintaining military strength in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Fed Chair Says Further Dollar Devaluation Unnecessary</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVE SKIDMORE</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> said Tuesday that a further decline in the dollar may hurt, rather than help, efforts to reduce the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit. <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON>, in a speech to <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said the devaluation of the dollar over the past three years has helped narrow the trade gap by dampening demand for more expensive foreign goods in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and stimulating sales of cheaper <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> goods overseas. However, <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> said it is questionable whether the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has the capacity to boost production of exports any faster than the current growth rate. Thus, further declines in the dollar, by raising the price of imports, could actually cause the deficit to grow, he said. `` I find no adjustment benefit to be derived from a further fall in the dollar,'' he said in a text of his speech released in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. In three years the dollar has lost about half of its value when measured against the Japanese yen. It rose somewhat in trading Tuesday on the news that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit for April had fallen to $ 9.9 billion, its lowest level in nearly 3 -LCB- years. It was the second time in less than a week that <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> has spoken against a further drop in the dollar. He issued a similar warning June 8 after meeting in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> with other nations' central bankers. Rather than devaluing the dollar, <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, `` reducing our federal budget deficit would be the most important step we can take in the adjustment process.'' On another topic, <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> said despite strained capacity in steel and certain chemicals, statistics on industrial delivery times do not indicate that inflationary bottlenecks are developing. Delivery times for production materials have moved up only moderately since late 1985 and have stabilized, at least temporarily, during the past five months, he said.

 Moslem guerrillas have punched through defenses of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s second-largest city and delayed Soviet troop withdrawal, Western diplomatic sources said Tuesday. The sources, speaking on condition their names not be used, said the guerrillas have penetrated the defenses of <LOCATION> Kandahar </LOCATION>, a provincial capital of 20,000 people about 270 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s capital. One diplomatic source, quoting a <LOCATION> Kandahar </LOCATION> resident, said guerrillas have been entering the city's bazaars daily to hunt communist military and government personnel. The diplomatic sources also said fighting there and the Afghan army garrison at Spin Buldak had slowed the Soviets' pullout from <LOCATION> Kandahar </LOCATION> province and increased speculation they may reinforce the area with additional troops. Spin Buldak is 60 miles southeast <LOCATION> Kandahar </LOCATION>, on the Pakistani border. Reports indicate the main areas of combat, in addition to <LOCATION> Kandahar </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, are at <LOCATION> Ghazni </LOCATION> to the south, <LOCATION> Khost </LOCATION> to the east and <LOCATION> Baghlan </LOCATION> city to the north near the Soviets' main withdrawal route. Pakistani sources say the guerrillas have taken the offensive this spring, capturing more than 25 towns and communist posts in the last three months. However, the diplomatic sources said <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s overall withdrawal from the country was continuing, with convoys last weekend heading north through <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> from the eastern garrisons of <LOCATION> Ghazni </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gardez </LOCATION>. They agreed with Kremlin figures that 13,000 Red Army troops have crossed the <LOCATION> Oxus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> onto home territory since the nine-month pullout began May 15 under an accord negotiated in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>'s Marxist president, <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>, said at the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> last week that 34,000 Soviets had left _ about a third of the more than 100,000 Soviets in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> Tuesday, a <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> official said Soviet troops on their way out of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> will strike back at Moslem guerrillas who attack. <PERSON> Vadim </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuznetsov </PERSON>, deputy head of the ministry's <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> desk, said that under the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> withdrawal accords, `` our troops were not supposed to take part in combat as they withdraw. Now they can. Obviously, they are going to defend themselves.'' <PERSON> Kuznetsov </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> there had been casualties, but that he was unable to give the extact time, place and extent of the attacks. His remarks were the most detailed explanation of a warning issued Monday by <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and <PERSON> Najib </PERSON> that violations of the accord would bring `` resolute retaliatory steps.'' Soviet troops came to <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in 1979 to bolster the communist government. The <ORGANIZATION> Indian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>, which already closed its missions in <LOCATION> Kandahar </LOCATION> and the eastern city of <LOCATION> Jalalabad </LOCATION>, has begun evacuating personnel from <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>, according to the source. That report appeared to contradict assertions this week by Indian Prime Minister <PERSON> Rajiv </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON> that survival prospects for <PERSON> Najib </PERSON>'s government were good.

<HEAD>Probe Of Runway Accident Turns Up Broken Thrust Reverser</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Investigators have removed a broken deceleration device from an <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> jet that veered from a runway after landing and injured five passengers, officials said Tuesday. The device, called a thrust reverser, slows planes during landings by diverting a jet engine's thrust. The recovery provided a possible explanation of why the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727-200 failed to stop on the runway Sunday night at <LOCATION> Seattle-Tacoma </LOCATION> International Airport. `` We do n't know when it occurred, but one side -LRB- of the two-piece unit -RRB- worked and the other was broken,'' said <PERSON> Candace </PERSON> <PERSON> Carrera </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>'s investigator in charge. The broken piece could create a `` twisting'' motion of the aircraft, Ms. <PERSON> Carrerra </PERSON> said, adding, `` That's getting into analysis and we're just not that far yet.'' The broken thrust reverser was on the center engine of the three-engine jet, Ms. <PERSON> Carrerra </PERSON> said. Investigators were disassembling the piece and will send it to <ORGANIZATION> NTSB </ORGANIZATION> laboratories in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION> for further testing, she said. Other plane parts were being tested in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>. Representatives of Seattle-based <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> were assisting in the investigation. Five of the 75 passengers aboard were injured slightly when Flight 187 from <LOCATION> Tucson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION> veered 400 feet off the runway and slid to a stop in mud, said <PERSON> Margo </PERSON> <PERSON> Spellman </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for <LOCATION> Sea-Tac </LOCATION> airport. Two were treated and released at area hospitals; three were treated at the scene. Airport officials earlier said four passengers were injured. Interviews with pilot <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wiley </PERSON>, 40, and the six other crew members Monday failed to shed any fresh light on the cause of the accident, Ms. <PERSON> Carrera </PERSON> said. Investigators appear to have ruled out a tire blowout as the cause, she said. When the jet's wheels were dug from the mud Monday, the left tire of the two-tire nose landing gear was found to be flat. `` It was n't a blowout, it was a deflated tire. It scraped off rubber while trying to stop,'' Ms. <PERSON> Carrera </PERSON> said.

 A portion of construction repair work at an Interstate 10 drainage structure collapsed Tuesday, injuring at least eight people, authorities said. <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> crews were dispatched to the collapse, on <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION>'s west side near an interchange under construction.

In February, a piece of heavy equipment struck a couple of columns in the drainage structure, at an arroyo that flows under I-10, causing an undetermined amount of damage, Ms. <PERSON> Best </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 Some residents of a quiet <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> neighborhood say they are unhappy and fearful to find that their new neighbor is <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON>, who was convicted in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> of raping a girl and chopping her arms off. `` We do n't want him here. Let them ship him back to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Winston </PERSON> <PERSON> Whittle </PERSON>, a retiree living directly across the street. `` Maybe commmunity pressure could be put on him. If it could be done out in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, it could be done here.'' <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON>, 60, was convicted of raping a 15-year-old hitchhiker, chopping her arms off above the elbow and leaving her for dead along a rural roadside southeast of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> in 1978. The former merchant seaman, who grew up in <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, served eight years of a 14-year sentence. When <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON> was released on parole, residents of a number of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> communities raised loudly vocal campaigns when their communities were mentioned as possible homes for the notorious inmate. One town even filed a lawsuit. Eventually, <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON> wound up serving his parole while housed in a mobile home on the grounds of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Quentin </LOCATION> prison. After he finished parole in April, <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON> came back to his home town and for his <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> driver's license registered his address as that of his brother, <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON>, in the <LOCATION> Forest </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> section of <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>. On Monday, he also registered with the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> to satisfy a state law requiring felons entering the state to register with authorities. <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, agent in charge of the enforcement agency in <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON> was photographed and fingerprinted and told agents he was receiving Social Security. <LOCATION> Forest </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION> is a quiet, well-kept section where houses sit on big lots, shaded by spreading oaks. Many of the residents are retired. Men in the area say women, especially widows and those living alone, are afraid. A gray-haired lady who lives with her sister and their little white poodle acknowledged being worried. `` Naturally, we're afraid,'' she said, asking that her name not be used <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Hosak </PERSON> lives next door to <LOCATION> Whittle </LOCATION>. He has owned his own home for 20 years and says <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON> and his wife <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> have lived across the street for about that same length of time. `` She has been a good neighbor,'' <PERSON> Hosak </PERSON> said of Mrs. <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON>. `` I feel sorry for the family. He's a relative. What can they do?'' <PERSON> Hosak </PERSON> said he followed the <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON> case 10 years ago in the newspapers but did n't know until Monday that <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON> was related to the family in his neighborhood. `` The fault is n't his. It's the system's fault for letting him out,'' <PERSON> Hosak </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Lillian </PERSON> <PERSON> Shepler </PERSON> also does n't like the idea of <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON> living nearby. `` I feel he needs custodial care. Being shunted wherever he goes is no picnic,'' she said. `` But the courts have found him guilty and you have to live with the knowledge that he's living next door. You never know, someone could go beserk.'' <PERSON> Singleton </PERSON> tries to avoid headlines and maintains his innocence, saying he has considered filing a complaint against the woman he was convicted of raping. The woman, now 24, lives in seclusion in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION>.

 Southern Baptists narrowly elected a fundamentalist as their president Tuesday, extending indefinitely the march to the right of the nation's largest Protestant denomination. In the high-stakes contest, the Rev. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Vines </PERSON> got 15,804 votes, or 50.5 percent, to defeat the Rev. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, who had 15,112, or 48.3 percent. Two other surprise nominees got a small scattering of ballots. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Craig </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Tulsa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Okla. </LOCATION>, engineer, had 276 votes, the Rev. <PERSON> Anis </PERSON> <PERSON> Shorrosh </PERSON> of Mobile, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, who had nominated himself, received 82. Vines' victory for a one-year term, which is traditionally renewed for a second year, extended the fundamentalist wing's denominational control into the 10th year it said it needed to enact its conservative theological-political agenda Vines, 50, is co-pastor of the <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, while runner-up <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, 49, is pastor of the <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Phoenix </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>. Each church has about 18,000 members Because of the size and country-wide influence of the 14.7 million member denomination, the direction set here was seen as having an impact in broader evangelical circles. About 35,000 `` messengers,'' as local church representatives are called, were present for the opening day of the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convention </ORGANIZATION>'s meeting, which runs through Thursday. Before the election, the outgoing president, the Rev. <PERSON> Adrian </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, unleashed a scathing attack on denominational `` liberals,'' which is what fundamentalists call the moderates. `` They have turned <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christianity </ORGANIZATION> into a graveyard,'' he said. Likening them to `` leaven of the Pharisees,'' he said such `` theological morticians have no right in Baptist pulpits.'' The Rev. <PERSON> Russell </PERSON> <PERSON> Dilday </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Southwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Theological </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seminary </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, criticized <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>' `` divisive tone. `` There was a frantic note, a pulling out of all the stops'' as if fearful of the election outcome, <PERSON> Dilday </PERSON> told reporters. `` I think our Baptist forefathers would be shocked.'' Moderates who have been gradually cut out of power by the prolonged fundamentalist surge have indicated they're not pulling out and splitting the denomination. `` We're not dead and I'm not quitting,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Winfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Amarillo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, a moderate leader. But he derided compromise with fundamentalists' demands. `` My granddaddy was absolutely right. He said, ` Son, there's nothing in the middle of the road but a yellow line and dead possums,''' <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> told a side meeting of moderate pastors. Zoological analogies also got a pre-election airing in the fundamentalist camp where a fiery <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> leader, the Rev. W.A. <PERSON> Criswell </PERSON>, declared: `` Liberals today call themselves moderates. A skunk by any other name still stinks.'' Bringing out the socio-political aspects of the fundamentalist drive, he blamed the `` curse of liberalism'' for turning the nation over to secularists, humanists, atheists and infidels. `` By law and legislation, we bow at no altar and call on the name of no God,'' he said. `` No longer can we pray in public schools, read God's word'' or `` have chapel services in public schools or place a nativity scene on the courthouse lawn.'' Among American Christians, Southern Baptists always have been pervasively conservative in their theology, stressing the autonomy of local congregations, church-state separation, no creedal rules but the Bible and `` soul competence'' of individuals to interpret it as they understand it. But the fundamentalist wing that won predominance in 1979, and has held it since, insists on viewing the Bible as literalistically `` inerrant'' _ without error _ historically, religiously and scientifically. Under the shiboleth of `` inerrancy,'' the fundamentalist wing has pressed a wide socio-political program generally identified with the new religious right that emerged about the same time at the turn of the 1980s. As the fundamentalists gained sway over institutional trustees through presidential appointive powers, several organizational and seminary staff members have been hit by restrictions and pressures that drove them from their posts. Screening processes have been instituted to make sure personnel adhere to certain beliefs, such as that <PERSON> Adam </PERSON> and Eve were real people and that biblical miracles actually occurred. Also, policies were invoked against women clergy and employing divorced pastors in most cases. Baptist fundamentalists unavailingly backed Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bork </PERSON> for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, contrary to Baptist practice against taking sides about particular candidates. The fundamentalist wing also has marshalled the denomination for other religious right causes _ prayer in public schools, capital punishment and condemning all abortion except to save the mother's life

<HEAD>Extradition Hearing For West German Suspect Sparks Riot</HEAD>
<DATELINE>AMSTERDAM, Netherlands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Dutch riot police battled West German and Dutch demonstrators outside a courthouse in <LOCATION> Amsterdam </LOCATION> on Tuesday where a suspect in the murder of two West German policemen was fighting extradition. A running street battle began during a hearing on the extradition of 25-year-old <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoffmann </PERSON> to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hoffmann </PERSON>, a West German citizen, denies involvement in the Nov. 2 shootings, which occurred during a demonstration against building a new runway at <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Rhein-Main </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hoffmann </PERSON> wore a leg restraint during the hearing. Defense attorney <PERSON> Pieter </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> <PERSON> Schut </PERSON> argued that the killings were political crimes, for which Dutch law bans extradition. Public prosecutor <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonn </PERSON> conceded the two killings were `` politically influenced'' but argued they could not be regarded as political crimes. A ruling on the extradition request is set for June 28. At least eight protesters were arrested in the fighting outside, said police spokesman <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> Detering </PERSON>. Police used baton charges to disperse about 100 protesters, many of them masked to avoid identification. Dozens of flak-jacketed police stood guard inside and outside the courthouse and four armed guards were detailed to <PERSON> Hoffman </PERSON>. Aside from those directly involved in the proceedings, only reporters were allowed inside the courtroom. About 30 <PERSON> Hoffmann </PERSON> sympathizers watched from a public gallery separated from the courtroom by bullet-proof glass. West German authorities say <PERSON> Hoffmann </PERSON> shot the West German officers with a police service pistol he stole during the protest. He also is charged with the attempted murder of two other policemen during the protest. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> also wants <PERSON> Hoffmann </PERSON> for alleged membership in an unspecified `` terrorist organization'' and for attacks against property in protests against <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s nuclear energy program. <PERSON> Hoffmann </PERSON> denied involvement in all instances. He grinned at his sympathizers and yelled `` Rebellion! Resistance!'' as police hustled him out of the courtroom at the end of the hearing.

 <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s defense lawyer told a jury Tuesday the former governor is being unjustly prosecuted by a politically ambitious attorney general whose aides are `` like the guards at <LOCATION> Auschwitz </LOCATION>.'' `` The prosecution wants a conviction in this case ... notwithstanding the innocence of these defendants,'' lawyer <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> said in closing arguments in <ORGANIZATION> Maricopa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. Prosecutor <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Cudahy </PERSON> insisted <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> and his brother, <PERSON> Willard </PERSON>, purposely concealed a $ 350,000 campaign loan from developer <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolfson </PERSON> on financial reports required by the state. `` <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> never had any intention of disclosing the <PERSON> Wolfson </PERSON> loan,'' <PERSON> Cudahy </PERSON> said. The prosecution was scheduled to finish its rebuttal Wednesday morning before the case is submitted to the jury for deliberations. `` I'm glad this day is here,'' <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, 64, told reporters before the arguments began. `` I want to get it over with. I want to get on with my life.'' <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> told the jurors that there was no motive to conceal <PERSON> Wolfson </PERSON> as the source of the loan because the campaign's financial reports were filed after the November 1986 election. The defense lawyer said <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> could have been charged with a misdemeanor for false campaign finance reporting, `` but a misdemeanor is not good enough for -LRB- Attorney General -RRB- <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Corbin </PERSON> and his henchmen.'' <PERSON> Corbin </PERSON> wanted a conviction on felony charges to further his own political ambitions, but he is `` not entitled to bring home <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s scalp and hang it in the trophy room at the attorney general's office,'' <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> said. `` Perhaps I should n't be so hard on my colleagues because, like the guards at <LOCATION> Auschwitz </LOCATION>, they're just doing their job,'' he said, referring to the prosecutors. <LOCATION> Auschwitz </LOCATION> was a Nazi death camp. In his rebuttal, co-prosecutor <PERSON> Barnett </PERSON> <PERSON> Lotstein </PERSON> accused <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> of making a `` vicious personal attack'' on him and <PERSON> Cudahy </PERSON>. `` It's not a new tactic. It's used when you do n't have anything else to say,'' <PERSON> Lotstein </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Cudahy </PERSON> said <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> desperately needed money for his 1986 gubernatorial campaign, which had a theme of integrity and abolishing special interests. `` Along came a pot of gold in the form of <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolfson </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> wound up selling that theme of integrity and ridding the state of hidden special interests when he and <PERSON> Willard </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> decided to hide from the public the $ 350,000 loan,'' <PERSON> Cudahy </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Cudahy </PERSON> said testimony showed that even some of <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s top aides and people who signed promissory notes to back the loan were not told it was coming from <PERSON> Wolfson </PERSON> and not from a bank. The loan was hidden on a campaign financial report as part of a `` fabricated'' $ 465,000 lump sum listed as a contribution from <LOCATION> Mecham </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Cudahy </PERSON> said. He also pointed to a letter in which <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> promised <PERSON> Wolfson </PERSON> the loan would `` remain confidential.'' <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> contended that the loan was properly reported as part of the $ 465,000 lump sum because <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> was responsible for its repayment. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> was charged with six felony counts of perjury, willful concealment and filing false documents and faced up to 22 years in prison if convicted. <PERSON> Willard </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, who was his brother's 1986 campaign treasurer, faced three similar counts and up to 9 -LCB- years in prison if convicted. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, a Republican, took office in January 1987 and was removed April 4 when the state <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> convicted him of two unrelated charges.

<TEXT>
 The fundamentalist operator of an unlicensed boarding school closed by the state amid allegations of abuse and neglect said Tuesday he did n't want supporters to bail him out of jail. `` I do n't want the people to put the money up for this _ not when we're right,'' the Rev. <PERSON> Herman </PERSON> <PERSON> Fountain </PERSON> said. Fountain spoke after an appearance before a <ORGANIZATION> Youth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> judge trying to decide the cases of 41 children taken last week by court order from the <LOCATION> Bethel </LOCATION> Home for Children in <LOCATION> Lucedale </LOCATION>. He was held in the <LOCATION> George </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> jail in lieu of $ 40,000 bond on three charges of felonious assault of a police officer. Meanwhile, $ 1,000 bonds were posted by two other people arrested Monday, when 60 state troopers and local officers raided a church on the 28-acre campus of the school. A June 24 court date was set for the two. They were among five people, including assistant pastor <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Owens </PERSON>, who were charged with disorderly conduct when the church was raided Monday. Since Friday, the state has taken 77 children from the home, with about 35 released to their parents. Officers entered the church to look for three children <PERSON> Fountain </PERSON> said he had taken back in. But <PERSON> Fountain </PERSON> said Tuesday the three were n't among 11 children taken by the state in the Monday raid. State officials said they took all of the children because church officials refused to identify for them the three they were looking for. <PERSON> Fountain </PERSON> said Tuesday that he knew where the three were, but would n't disclose their location, which he said was n't on the campus. `` If they are going to take these kids to the mental hospital, I ai n't going to have no part of it,'' <PERSON> Fountain </PERSON> said. The children turned over to the state temporarily were being housed at the state psychiatric hospital at <LOCATION> Whitfield </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Fountain </PERSON> said he had heard that the children in state custody were being allowed to smoke and play rock music. `` That really upsets me,'' he said. Asked about discipline methods at his school, which have come under fire off and on since 1980, <PERSON> Foutain </PERSON> claimed only God can set the limits but that he and staffers had guidelines. No more than 10 licks with a switch were allowed, he said. Asked the kind of paddle or switch used, he said: `` An old mamma's switch _ like the one you pick up in the woods.'' Chancery Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Oswald </PERSON>, who presides over the youth court, continued hearings at which he required parents or guardians to promise not to send the children back to <LOCATION> Bethel </LOCATION>. He ruled that the children, ages 10 to 17, had been subjected `` to physical abuse, medical neglect and detention amounting to imprisonment'' at <LOCATION> Bethel </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Iran Claims Thousands of Iraqi Casualties; Iraq Says New Front
Opened</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: UPDATES throughout with new details from both sides.</NOTE>
<DATELINE>NICOSIA, Cyprus (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> claimed Tuesday that it recaptured five strategic heights in new battles on the northern front while <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> reported that the Iraqis suffered 19,000 casualties in their southern offensive. The official <ORGANIZATION> Iraqi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> forces backed by helicopter gunships and fighter planes stormed Iranian-held positions in northern <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> to win back the heights. It said artillery, tank and infantry units joined in retaking five Iranian positions in the mountain peaks of <LOCATION> Suliamaniya </LOCATION> province, but It did not say when the offensive started or how long it lasted. Iranian news reports made no mention of fighting in the north. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said Iranian forces killed or wounded 19,000 Iraqis after launching a new offensive east of <LOCATION> Basra </LOCATION> in southern <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> on Monday. The various reports were monitored in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>. Claims by the opposing sides could not be independently verified as both countries rarely allow independent observers near the 730-mile front. The war began in September 1980. The Iranian military communique said more than 1,500 Iraqis were killed or wounded Tuesday and that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s heavy artillery destroyed tanks, personnel carriers and other vehicles. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> also claimed that Iraqi warplanes dropped chemical weapons on a village in <LOCATION> Kurdistan </LOCATION> province at 8 a.m. Tuesday, killing two villagers and `` poisoning'' 10 others, according to <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s official news agency said Tuesday that <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s attack in the southern zone was contained and Iraqi troops counterattacked. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> protested to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday, saying sanctions should be imposed against <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> for attacks on Iraqi territory. In the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>, Iranian gunboats riddled a Singapore-flagged tanker with machine-gun fire as the `` tanker war'' flared anew in northern waters that were relatively quiet for months. Gulf-based shipping executives said the 87,768-ton <ORGANIZATION> Neptune </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Subaru </ORGANIZATION> was attacked about 6 a.m. as it sailed toward <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> to pick up a cargo of crude oil. The executives said no casualties were reported, the crew extinguished several fires, and the ship sailed under its own power to the <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabian </LOCATION> port of <LOCATION> Jubail </LOCATION>. Iranian television on Tuesday quoted <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>, speaker of <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> and commander in chief of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s armed forces, as saying he was `` pessimistic'' about <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> surrendering in the war. <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> was quoted as saying <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> is `` not insisting on getting our rights on the battlefield with military means.'' That could indicate a softening in <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s avowed determination to crush the <LOCATION> Iraqi </LOCATION> government, but <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> also spoke of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s insistence that the war will end only when President <PERSON> Saddam </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> is ousted <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> has expressed its willingness to accept a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> resolution passed last year calling for a cease-fire, but <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has not. In February 1986, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> captured the <LOCATION> Faw </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Basra </LOCATION> but was driven out by an Iraqi offensive last April. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> launched new attacks in late May to regain the peninsula at the northern tip of the gulf and both sides have claimed victories. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> said Monday that its troops, under the direction of President <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON>, fought for 19 hours to repulse the Iranian incursion and that <PERSON> Hussein </PERSON> returned to the capital of <LOCATION> Baghdad </LOCATION> afer the main fighting ended. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> claimed its forces recaptured some of the land lost in April.

<TEXT>
 Gunmen kidnapped the three children of a Sunni Moslem businessman Tuesday after stopping the car taking them to school and shooting the driver in the legs, police reported. They said police units and Syrian soldiers in Moslem west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> arrested four suspects but the victims were not found. A police spokesman said six gunmen in two cars intercepted the chauffeur-driven <ORGANIZATION> Mercedes-Benz </ORGANIZATION> limousine Tuesday morning. `` Three gunmen jumped out of a white <ORGANIZATION> Volvo </ORGANIZATION>, shot the driver in the legs from silencer-equipped pistols, pulled the children out and forced them into another <ORGANIZATION> Mercedes-Benz </ORGANIZATION> and sped away,'' the spokesman said. The spokesman, not identified according to police regulations, said the victims were the children of <PERSON> Zuhair </PERSON> <PERSON> Ariss </PERSON>, owner of a jewelry shop and a foreign exchange company in west <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>. The officer idenfied the captives as <PERSON> Dunia </PERSON>, 14, and her brothers <PERSON> Samer </PERSON>, 9, and <PERSON> Ramzi </PERSON>, 5. He said the kidnappings were carried out `` for ransom,'' although no note was received. A police communique said security forces seized four gunmen in connection with the abductions in a raid on the bomb-ravaged <ORGANIZATION> Hilton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hotel </ORGANIZATION>, controlled by pro-Iranian Shiite Moslems of the <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or Party of God, organization. In other developments, a cease-fire officially took effect Tuesday among Palestinian factions battling in two <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> refugee camps, but one group reportedly continued fighting. In <LOCATION> Damascus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, the Palestinian group Fatah-Uprising of Col. <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Mousa </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Palestinian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> factions began observing the truce early Tuesday. But a spokesman for <PERSON> Mousa </PERSON> later said the mainstream <ORGANIZATION> Fatah </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> continued fighting. The struggle for mastery of the <LOCATION> Chatilla </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Bourj </PERSON> el-Barajneh camps flared last week between <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON>'s group and the <ORGANIZATION> Fatah-Uprising </ORGANIZATION> backed by <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>. Syrian troops recently moved into the southern suburbs of <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> to quell fighting between Shiite Moslem militias. In southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, 20 <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers continued to blockade the outpost of a Norwegian unit of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peace-keeping force for the second day.

 A family tearfully accepted the remains of a soldier Tuesday, more than two decades after his plane was shot down over <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. `` The 22-year nightmare is over,'' said <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Chiarello </PERSON>, brother of Lt. Col. <PERSON> Vincent </PERSON> <PERSON> Chiarello </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> intelligence officer. <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Chiarello </PERSON>, the officer's mother, broke down during an honor guard ceremony as the remains were presented to the family at <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>. Later, during a news conference, she said she will take off the MIA bracelet engraved with her son's name that she has worn since 1978. `` I will be happy to wear one for another MIA until he comes home,'' she said. Other relatives also said they will continue to help other families with missing loved ones. `` We beseech the Vietnamese government ... to act expeditiously on behalf of all these families,'' <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Chiarello </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Chiarello </PERSON>'s plane was shot down near the Laotian border on July 29, 1966, according to <PERSON> Joanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Cornell </PERSON>, the officer's sister. About four months ago, the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> told the family the Vietnamese government was returning the remains of 20 <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> soldiers, including <PERSON> Chiarello </PERSON>. However, on March 3, the remains of only 17 soldiers were returned along with identification cards for <PERSON> Chiarello </PERSON> and two others. It took an exhaustive comparison of remains with dental, military and family records to finally identify <PERSON> Chiarello </PERSON>. `` The findings were so definite,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Cornell </PERSON>. `` We felt we must accept this. We feel beyond a shadow of a doubt these are my brother's remains.'' <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Engkilterra </PERSON>, a coordinator with the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>, an organization working for information about all Americans missing in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, said there were `` 2,400 stories out there that need to be told so this does n't become a one-day event.'' The family will bury the remains Saturday in <LOCATION> Newtown </LOCATION>, about 25 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, after a funeral Mass.

 About 60,000 government employees demanding more pay staged a one-day strike Tuesday, shutting down <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s railroads and disrupting government ministries, hospitals and airports Court clerks did not show up for work and tax offices were closed. The job action originally was open-ended, but organizers later called on workers to return to their jobs Wednesday. Union leaders said they will attach their labor dispute to the wage negotiations being held between the <ORGANIZATION> Histadrut </ORGANIZATION> trade union federation and the <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>. Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> condemned the strike. `` I think there was no need for the strike that causes damages and creates inconvenience for the economy,'' he told <ORGANIZATION> Israel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION>. At <LOCATION> Ben </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gurion </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, an emergency staff of 10 out of 180 customs officials checked the luggage of passengers on incoming flights, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> army radio reported.

The strike came after the failure of seven-hour talks Monday between the union of civil servants and the <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>. Media reports said the ministry told the strikers it will exclude the strike days from their salaries. But union secretary <PERSON> Reuven </PERSON> <PERSON> Ben-Ami </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> that the civil servants, whose average monthly salary is about $ 625, are `` ready to sacrifice to achieve better wages.'' Union officials said they are demanding a wage increase of $ 77, a raise in medical payments and an increase in the annual recreation period covered by these payments to 15 days instead of 11.

 More than 100 <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Toronto </ORGANIZATION> students defied campus administrators Tuesday and held a protest against their university's acting as host for part of the seven-nation economic summit conference next week. `` If no one's going to point out the crimes of the <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seven </ORGANIZATION>, then we're all in trouble,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Polanyi </PERSON>, 21, son of professor <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Polanyi </PERSON>, the Nobel laureate for chemistry in 1986 who teaches at the university. Leaders of the seven nations will visit the downtown campus for working dinners Monday at <ORGANIZATION> Hart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, a cultural and social center. `` One of the reasons they are coming to <ORGANIZATION> Hart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> is to find an idyllic surrounding, but we just wo n't be quiet, we wo n't make it easy for them,'' said <PERSON> Polanyi </PERSON>, a political science student and spokesman for a coalition organizing a `` Popular Summit.'' Asked what his father thought of his risking arrest, <PERSON> Polanyi </PERSON> said, `` He's supportive.'' The protesters erected eight tents on a lawn outside <ORGANIZATION> Hart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> in defiance of an administration ruling that the tent complex would pose a threat to public health because of the lack of water and sanitation. The students began the protest Tuesday evening with songs and banners objecting to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, British rule in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> and the presence of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and other leaders on campus. University spokesman <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Lindt </PERSON> said campus police warned students to disperse and threatened to issue tickets for illegal trespassing and camping, which carry a $ 53 -LRB- $ 43 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> -RRB- fine. One of the protesters, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bruckner </PERSON>, a 21-year-old archaeology major, said students were upset that the university decided to be host to the leaders of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> without consulting the 34,000-member student body. `` Why are n't they -LRB- the seven leaders -RRB- talking about the problems their economic system forces on the world _ poverty, homelessness, the underfunding of universities, the problems of native peoples, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>?'' he said. Last week, a <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> anti-nuclear group staged a mock trial of the summit leaders for alleged `` crimes against humanity,'' including <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid to rebels in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, nuclear armaments and support for the white-led government of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>.

 Bidders offered more than $ 2.5 million Tuesday for a trove of gold, silver and emeralds that had laid undisturbed for centuries on the bottom of the sea until found by treasure hunter <PERSON> Mel </PERSON> <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON>. A 62-inch-long gold chain formed from 136 oval links attracted the most attention and fetched $ 319,000 in spirited but quick bidding. The chain, purchased by an anonymous telephone bidder, had an estimated pre-sale price of $ 150,000 to $ 250,000. The auction was the first of a two-day sale at <PERSON> Christie </PERSON>'s auction house of booty recovered from Spanish sailing ships discovered in the <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> by <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON>, a diver who has devoted much of his life to treasure hunting The auction house said more than 70 percent of the items offered Tuesday were sold for a total of $ 2,588,443. The treasure _ which included gold and silver bars, jewelry and artifacts as well as coins, emeralds and 17th century navigation instruments _ was taken mostly from the Spanish treasure galleons <PERSON> Nuestra </PERSON> <PERSON> Senora </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Atocha </PERSON> and her sister ship the <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Margarita </LOCATION>. The two vessels, battered by a hurricane, went down off the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Keys </LOCATION> in September 1622. A gold two-handled cup recovered from what's believed to be the <LOCATION> Santo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cristo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Roman </LOCATION>, part of the Spanish fleet sunk in 1715, brought the night's second-highest sale price, $ 275,000. It was bought by a <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> dealer, S.J. <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON>. The <PERSON> Santo </PERSON> <PERSON> Cristo </PERSON> was one of six wrecks found by salvors working off the east coast of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> near <LOCATION> Vero </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON>, who attended the auction with heavy gold chains salvaged from the Atocha draped around his neck, said he was satisfied with the sale and said there would likely be others. `` We're still dividing the treasure. It's taken us three years to divide it all up,'' he said. Tuesday's items were offered by backers who financed <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON>'s expeditions in exchange for a share of the proceeds <PERSON> Fisher </PERSON> began his search for the Atocha in the Keys in 1968 and found the vessel three years later. In 1980 he discovered the <LOCATION> Margarita </LOCATION>. The treasure hunter himself had only one item in the sale, the gold cup, which he owned with an investor. `` I did n't want to saw it in two, give him half and keep half,'' he said. So he sold it.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> and his Cabinet on Tuesday discussed dramatic new economic policies that lift price and wage controls, the president's office said. Details were not immediately known, but it appeared the leftist <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> government was moving away from central control toward a Western-style free market. <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Bolanos </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Private </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, said his umbrella group for privately owned businesses supports the removal of price controls. But he warned it might further fuel inflation, now running at about 4,000 percent. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> failed to show up for a news conference Tuesday and his office said he was held up by meetings with <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> members. <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> announced on Saturday that the government was withdrawing a wage scale in effect since 1985. The idea, he said, was to link wages to productivity, sharply down in recent years. But some speculation arose that basing salaries on production might cause a surge in unemployment. Six years of civil war coupled with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade sanctions enacted in 1985 have shattered the Nicaraguan economy. `` For all intents and purposes, <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> at the end of 1987 was a bankrupt country,'' said a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy report in January. <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> has a foreign debt of more than $ 6 billion. Soviet bloc infusions of about $ 400 million a year fail to cover the country's trade deficit. From 1980 to the end of 1987, inflation caused the average urban worker's purchasing power to drop almost 90 percent. The government has controlled salaries, basic foodstuffs, the prices of primary products and the distribution of imports and exports. Measures taken by the government have failed to right the economy, which was in disarray when the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> came to power in a 1979 revolution that deposed dictator <PERSON> Anastasio </PERSON> <PERSON> Somoza </PERSON>. The Sandinistas promised broad social programs and benefits. But the war by the U.S.-backed rebels known as Contras started a little more than a year after the revolution. Today, despite a fragile, three-month cease-fire, about 60 percent of the national budget goes toward defense. The <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> put the war's pricetag at $ 3 billion. Thousands of Nicaraguans fled the fighting for the cities, leaving behind fertile lands in the northern and central war zones. Young peasants who normally would work on farms are forced to fight for either the Contras or the Sandinistas In April, the government began laying off 20,000 public employees in hopes they would turn to agriculture.

 Veteran endurance runner <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Goodwin </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lewis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, reported Monday that she completed a 1,300-mile run through the <LOCATION> Nepal-Himalayan </LOCATION> region and said she was the first solitary runner to do so. She said she had to cope with an elephant charge and 110-plus heat to accomplish her feat, but added, `` I have done the Nepal-Himalaya run exactly in one day less than three months. Now I am crossing to <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>. But that is a big problem. At the moment the border is closed.'' <PERSON> Goodwin </PERSON>, 50, told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> by telephone from <LOCATION> Mahendranagar </LOCATION>, about 330 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Katmandu </LOCATION>, that she arrived at the Nepalese township along the border Sunday in a bid to complete her trans-Himalayan run from <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>'s Darjeeling city in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bengal </LOCATION> state to <LOCATION> Gulmarg </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Kashmir </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>. She left Darjeeling on March 11 and entered into the Himalayan kingdom of <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION> two days later. Her only companion was a 2-year-old German shorthair pointer, <PERSON> Velia </PERSON>. `` But <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> has closed this point of the border to foreigners,'' she said. `` The Banbasha Bazar of the northern Indian state of <LOCATION> Uttar </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pradesh </LOCATION> is only 15 miles away from here. But I ca n't go there from here,'' <PERSON> goodwin </PERSON> said. She said that before setting she went to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION> and thought she had secured permission from the Indian authorities for the trans-Himalayan run. <PERSON> Goodwin </PERSON> said she sent a message to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION> to approach the Indian authorities again. She described the crossing of the Nepalese Himalayan foothills from one end of <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION> to the another as a `` big victory for me.. I have today become the fastest woman, and the first solo runner through the Himalayan kingdom.'' After leaving the mountainous region on Thursday, <PERSON> Goodwin </PERSON> said she and her dog arrived at <LOCATION> Chisapani </LOCATION> in the tropical plains of south <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION>. `` We had come through the tigers and snakes areas ... coming from <LOCATION> Chisapani </LOCATION> all the way to <LOCATION> Mahendranagar </LOCATION>,'' she reported. She said she had to spend three days to complete the 112-mile Chisapani-Mahendranagar route in a heat of more than 110 degrees. `` My dog had been surrounded by troops of monkeys all along the road every day. And while we were resting on the bank of <LOCATION> Karnali </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, a huge elephant came out of a nearby jungle, charging us.. both me and my dog.'' They got out of that without harm, but she noted that `` even my dog did not sleep on the ground because of snakes.'' `` There was no bridge on the river,'' <PERSON> Goodwin </PERSON> said, `` My dog had to swim. I was wading across it. But the water was very deep. So all the day long, I had to move with wet shoes and wet clothes.'' <PERSON> Goodwin </PERSON> has been participating in endurance events since the 1950s. She was the first woman to run the 1,000-mile route through <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wales </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and also completed a 2,000-mile trip through <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> in 1986. A former resident of northern <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, she served as director of environmental and conservation matters in the Office of the Secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> from 1979-83.

<HEAD>Oil Prices Fall Amid Pessimism Over OPEC Meeting</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>

 Continued failure by <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> members to agree on a new pricing and production agreement has sent oil prices lower. On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the July contract for <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intermediate </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> benchmark crude, fell 30 cents Monday to close at $ 16.43 a barrel. Among refined products traded on the exchange, unleaded gasoline fell 0.71 cent a gallon to 48.51 cents, and home heating oil declined .50 cent to 43.75 cents a gallon. Members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries, meeting in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION>, agreed Monday to extend their existing production accord but kept haggling over whether to prolong it for three months or six months. Analysts in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> said an extension of the accord highlighted the members' inability to overcome their differences on output levels and reach a new agreement. The agreement already has been extended once _ from last December until this month _ because the 13 <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> members could not reach a new pact. One <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> faction wants to cut production to push weak oil prices higher. Another _ including <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> _ wants to increase production or at least maintain it at current levels to take advantage of an expected increase in demand in the second half of the year. `` It comes down to the Saudis and their allies are not interested in doing anything to shore up the price of oil,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Beutel </PERSON>, an assistant director of the energy group at <ORGANIZATION> Elders </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Supreme Court Ruling Gives Banks Limited Underwriting Powers</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VIVIAN MARINO</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
 Major banks are applauding the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s ruling that banks can use subsidiaries to underwrite and deal in some securities as another step toward their industry's expansion into lucrative investment banking. Some banking companies, including <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, said Monday that they planned to take advantage of their new underwriting powers before the end of the week. Others, such as <ORGANIZATION> Chase </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manhattan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, said they would begin operations some time this summer. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>'s ruling Monday upheld a lower court decision permitting banks to use subsidiaries to underwrite and deal in municipal revenue bonds, mortgage-related securities and commercial paper, a form of short-term corporate IOU. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> had granted such powers to seven of the nation's biggest banks, but restricted the activity to no more than 5 percent to 10 percent of the subsidary's gross revenue. That action was appealed by the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. In its decision, the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> let stand an appeals court ruling four months ago that such activity did not violate the Depression-era Glass-Steagall Act. The law, passed by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in the wake of the 1929 stock market crash, was aimed primarily at protecting the financial stability of banks by restricting them from speculating in stocks and bonds. Congressional legislation is pending to repeal parts of the law. Rep. <PERSON> Fernand </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> St </PERSON> <PERSON> Germain </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-R.I. </LOCATION>, said the court's decision would not deter the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> banking committee, which he chairs, from legislating such ground rules. `` A majority of the banking committee ... feel that it is a mistake to alllow the future structure of the financial community to be decided by the regulatory agencies and the courts,'' <ORGANIZATION> St </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Germain </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement released Monday by his office. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Pistor </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bankers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said Monday's ruling displayed `` another hole in the anti-competitive Glass-Steagall Act and another important victory for consumers. But, before large numbers of bank customers will benefit, we need to repeal the Glass-Steagall Act and allow all banks to offer securities services.'' <ORGANIZATION> SIA </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> said his group was disappointed by the decision. `` But we are pleased the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> itself has erected a series of firewalls ... to prevent banks from taking excessive risks within the securities arena which would further weaken banks and thus endanger the nation's economy,'' he said. In other <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decisions Monday, the justices: _ Let stand a ruling that allows states indirectly to tax interest paid to banks and other financial institutions from investments in <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> bonds _ Ruled unanimously the government may be forced to pay damages when a vaccine it licenses causes the disease it was intended to prevent _ Barred states from banning all direct mail advertisements sent by lawyers to potential clients _ Ruled the <ORGANIZATION> Postal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> was similar to a private business and must pay interest on back pay owed to a <LOCATION> Chesterfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, worker who won a lawsuit charging it with illegal discrimination _ Ruled that companies may violate antitrust law when they lobby private organizations that play a prominent role in influencing business legislation _ Struck down a federal antitrust lawsuit by actor <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Newman </PERSON> and director <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Hill </PERSON> over profits from video cassette sales and rentals

 <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> says he has put $ 310.2 million into an escrow account to be divided among <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> shareholders if he fails to come up with financing for his $ 60-per-share offer to buy the company. At its <LOCATION> White </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, headquarters, the nation's third-largest oil company reacted skeptically to the action Monday by its biggest shareholder, saying <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> had `` been caught red-handed giving the <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> shareholder false and misleading information. `` Given the number of strings and conditions that remain attached to this money, it does n't matter to the <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> shareholder what account <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> puts it in,'' <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> stated. `` He can move it from one pocket to another as much as he wants _ we are still convinced it will never get to <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> shareholders.'' <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> also said he had sent a signed `` bare bones'' $ 60 a share merger agreement to the company. `` If <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> executes the merger agreement, we will terminate our proxy contest and withdraw our slate of nominees,'' the statement said, referring to <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>'s attempt to elect himself and four colleagues to <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>'s board of directors. <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> has said repeatedly it was not interested in <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>'s advances <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>'s stock slid $ 1.37 -LCB- to $ 50.50 a share Monday in consolidated nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed issues. It has remained in the $ 50-per-share range since <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> launched his bid last month. <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> has offered to pay $ 12.4 billion for the 207 million <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> shares he does not already own. He paid about $ 1.2 billion for his existing stake of about 36 million shares. The offer puts a value of $ 14.6 billion on the oil company. But <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> has refused to put <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>'s buyout offer to a shareholder vote, prompting him to field the slate of five candidates for <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>' 14-member board. <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> has said he wants the seats on <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>'s board so he can pressure it into putting his offer before the shareholders. The proxy fight deadline is Friday, when <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> holds its annual meeting in <LOCATION> Tulsa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Okla </LOCATION>. Originally, <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> offered to put $ 100 million in escrow to ease market suspicions that he could not come up with the money actually to buy the company. Last week, <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> increased the guarantee to $ 300 million, and promised it would be distributed directly to <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> shareholders, instead of the company treasury, if he failed to get financing. <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>'s statement that $ 310,201,955 in cash was placed in escrow with <ORGANIZATION> Fleet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Providence </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> R.I. </LOCATION> _ $ 1.50 per share for all <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> stockholders eligible to vote on the special meeting he is seeking _ apparently was designed to stifle <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>'s criticism that he was unlikely ever to have to pay the money. <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> said the escrow would be forfeited if, at the time of the special stockholders meeting to vote on his offer, the financing was not in place. He said the escrow would not be forfeited if by the time of the meeting another entity made a legitimate bid for more than $ 60 per share, or if the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> failed to give required approval to <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>'s proposal. <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> said Friday he was forming a new holding company to act as his sole vehicle for acquisitions, including a possible hostile takeover bid for <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>. He said the holding company intended to raise up to $ 3.25 billion through an offering of stock and debt securities. <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> stated that if his slate was elected but a majority of the <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> board refused to allow a shareholder vote on the offer, he would consider making a hostile bid for it through the new holding company at yet to be determined terms.

<TEXT>
 A continuing decline in the number of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> business starts reflects the nation's changing economic profile and not necessarily broad economic problems, according to a business information concern. The number of new domestic businesses declined by 6.6 percent to 53,382 in the first three months of the year _ the seventh straight quarterly drop _ from 57,158 in first quarter 1987, according to <ORGANIZATION> Dun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Bradstreet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Dun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Bradstreet </ORGANIZATION> officials cited the maturing of the nation's economic expansion, now in its sixth year, and a shift from consumerism to export-driven growth as factors in the decline of business starts, a barometer of economic activity and money-making <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Dun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Bradstreet </ORGANIZATION>'s corporate economist and chief statistician, said new retailing businesses fell because of expectations that consumer demand will weaken, and startups of new service businesses fell in response to increased competition and corporate budget reductions. Retailing and service concerns account for about half of all new businesses. `` While the current surge in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exports will create new business opportunities in some sectors, existing manufacturers are the primary beneficiaries,'' <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON> said in a report of the latest figures. Business starts are considered important because they signal the level of entrepreneurial activity and perceived opportunities for profit in local area markets. But a persistent decline in starts does not necessarily indicate a broader economic problem, said <PERSON> Reid </PERSON> <PERSON> Gearhart </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Dun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Bradstreet </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. `` With the recovery in its sixth year, that's just having a dampening effect,'' he said. `` It's not really a negative.'' <ORGANIZATION> Dun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Bradstreet data indicated first-quarter business starts fell in seven of the nine major industry sectors. The largest decrease came in the finance-insurance-real estate category, which fell 9.8 percent. Retail business starts dropped 8.1 percent and services fell 5.7 percent. Starts also fell in the construction, manufacturing, wholesale and transportation sectors, with decreases of between 5 percent and 8 percent. Increases were in agriculture, up 11.5 percent, and mining, up 2.3 percent. `` Both mining, which includes oil and gas extraction businesses, and agriculture appear to be turning the corner after several years of severe stress,'' <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON> said. Despite a drop in manufacturing-related business starts, there was evidence that export growth was encouraging some entrepreneurs, <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON> said. An analysis of manufacturing starts showed significant increases among motor vehicle and equipment makers, metal producers and office equipment manufacturers. Geographically, first-quarter starts fell nationwide, with the largest decreases in the <LOCATION> Rocky </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> states, down 15.6 percent. Other significant drops occurred in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> states, down 12.2 percent, and the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> states, down 12 percent. Starts in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> dropped only 1.1 percent, while starts in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> states were both down 3.3 percent. Starts fell 3.8 percent in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> states, 6.7 percent in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> states and 6.3 percent in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> states. <ORGANIZATION> Dun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Bradstreet </ORGANIZATION> describes itself as the world's largest marketer of business information and related services, with revenue of $ 3.4 billion in 1987.

<TEXT>
 The government is trying to tame the wide swings in the monthly <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit, changes which in the past have sent stock prices plunging, but analysts are not sure the effortwill be a success. Financial markets were braced for more bad news today with release of the trade deficit for April. In advance of the report, many economists were predicting the deficit could widen to around $ 12.3 billion, compared to a March deficit of $ 11.9 billion. The last time the trade deficit widened, when the February figure was reported, the dollar came under intense selling pressure worldwide and the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrial average fell by 101 points, its fifth-worst loss ever. Analysts did n't expect such a dramatic reaction to this report, mainly because financial markets already were expecting the April deficit to be higher. However, if it came in much higher than the expected $ 12.3 billion, it had the potential to set off alarms in financial markets. For the first time in two years, the government has begun seasonally adjusting the monthly deficit figures to take into account normal seasonal changes in shipping patterns. Most government statistics are adjusted to factor out fluctuations which occur on a seasonal basis, such as the normal rise in retail sales right before Christmas. The government was forced to abandon seasonal adjustments of the trade figures in December 1985 because of lags in gathering the data. Those problems have since been corrected and seasonal adjustments are being re-introduced. By adjusting for normal seasonal swings, the government hopes to make the trade series less erratic and therefore ease the jolt financial markets sometimes receive. A string of bad monthly trade figures was blamed for adding to the pessimistic mood right before last October's stock market crash and there have been other periodic jolts, including the big drop in the stock market after the February deficit figure was released. But <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinai </PERSON>, chief economist for the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, said he did not believe the seasonal adjustments will do much to smooth out the monthly swings because of the erratic nature of trade shipments, when any single month can be affected by a number of factors. In fact, one reason analysts were looking for a wider deficit figure in April was the absence of gold shipments to <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>. In March, the <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> government purchased over $ 700 million in gold as a way of lowering its trade surplus with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which has been pressuring <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> to do more to open up its country to <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> goods. Even with erratic month-to-month swings, economists are optimistic that the overall trade deficit, which hit a record $ 170.3 billion, is finally headed lower. `` The trade deficit is slowly turning and that should be the story for the rest of the year,'' <PERSON> Sinai </PERSON> said. A recent survey by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economists </ORGANIZATION> showed they expect the trade defict to decline to around $ 150 billion this year and $ 125 billion in 1989.

 <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> ministers reached agreement today to extend their existing oil output pact for six months but failed to take any further steps aimed at limiting production and boosting prices. Venezuelan oil minister <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON> <PERSON> Grisanti </PERSON>, disclosing the agreement to reporters at the 13-nation cartel's regular midyear meeting, said `` we think the market will have a good perception of what we have done.'' Nevertheless, the agreement confirmed widespread speculation that the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION> would n't agree on significant new moves to cut the world supply of oil Prices are now substantially below <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 18-per-barrel objective. On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, a sensitive barometer of prices, the July contract for <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intermediate </ORGANIZATION> crude fell 30 cents Monday to close at $ 16.43 a barrel, partly in anticipation of the <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> agreement reached today. The ministers, who began their conference on Saturday, gathered to decide whether to change the agreement among 12 of the producers that limits output to 15.06 million barrels a day. Delegation sources said the ministers had haggled over whether to extend the accord by three months or six months. The accord was to have expired June 30. High-level sources in several delegations, speaking on condition of anonymity earlier, said a majority of the <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> ministers had favored the shorter extension. But the minority, favoring the longer extension, included influential <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s biggest producer. Analysts had said the prospect of yet another extension highlighted <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s inability to overcome its differences on production levels and agree on a common formula to raise prices. One <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> faction has wanted to cut production to push prices up to the target level. The Saudi-led minority has wanted to increase production or at least maintain it at current levels to take advantage of an increase in demand expected in the second half of the year and to maintain <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION>'s market share. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> refused to sign the current accord because it wants a quota equal to that of <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, with which it has been at war since 1980. <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Rilwanu </PERSON> <PERSON> Lukman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION>'s oil minister, said it was unlikely <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> would participate in the latest agreement. <PERSON> Lukman </PERSON> said Monday that the ministers were working hard on a compromise to bring <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> back into the fold. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> has a daily production quota of 2.369 million barrels. <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, which previously had a quota of 1.54 million barrels a day, is producing 2.6 million barrels daily. Success on that front would lower <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>'s production, which could help boost oil prices. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION>' oil minister, <PERSON> Mana </PERSON> <PERSON> Saeed </PERSON> <PERSON> Oteiba </PERSON>, left the talks on Sunday. He said he needed to consult with his government and might or might not return, although he left the rest of the <LOCATION> UAE </LOCATION> delegation behind. <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON>, however, said it was likely <PERSON> Otgiba </PERSON> would return today to sign the rollover agreement. <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> members are <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ecuador </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Gabon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Qatar </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Emirates </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>.

 While most beer companies grapple with a stagnant market, <ORGANIZATION> Anheuser-Busch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> is soaking up customers and leaving some observers scratching their heads. `` That's the $ 64 question,'' said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Walters </PERSON>, research director for <ORGANIZATION> M. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shanken </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> which publishes beverage industry magazines. Since the beginning of the decade, <PERSON> Anheuser </PERSON> has raised its share of the market from 28 percent to nearly 40 percent largely due to growth in Budweiser sales, which have bubbled from 35 million barrels in 1980 to 50 million last year. The answers given for the company's success range from superior marketing and management to high quality products to other factors that are less tangible. For example, Budweiser appears to succeed in getting consumers at an early age and keeping them, said <PERSON> Emanuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldman </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Montgomery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION>. If beer customers want to try a different brand, and that product happens to be unavailable, then the consumers most commonly choose a Budweiser, analysts say. `` It's become everybody's No. 2 brand,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Collopy </PERSON>, who follows the beer industry and is president of the <ORGANIZATION> Milwaukee </ORGANIZATION> investment firm, <ORGANIZATION> Cleary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gull </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reiland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> McDevitt </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Collopy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Weinberg </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> analyst who is a former <ORGANIZATION> Anheuser </ORGANIZATION> executive, said some of the brewer's successful strategies emerged after the company was bruised by its current main competitor, <ORGANIZATION> Miller </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brewing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Milwaukee </LOCATION> <PERSON> Weinberg </PERSON> said <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> was first to use the marketing technique of putting the consumer at the center of an ad, with the <ORGANIZATION> Miller </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> slogan: `` If you've got the time, we've got the beer.'' `` It had <ORGANIZATION> Anheuser-Busch </ORGANIZATION> spinning through 1975,'' <PERSON> Weinberg </PERSON> said, and <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> was able to eat away much of <PERSON> Anheuser </PERSON>'s lead. But <PERSON> Anheuser </PERSON>, he said, responded with its own consumer-oriented slogan, `` This Bud's for you,'' which helped the company recapture its momentum. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> MacDonough </PERSON>, vice president of brand management at <LOCATION> Anheuser </LOCATION>, said advertising alone can not carry a product. `` All I can say is that the consumer is very sensitive,'' he said. `` No amount of marketing could keep a product going if you do n't have a good product.'' Analysts also note that <PERSON> Budweiser </PERSON> has been protected from the discount beer battles of <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Stroh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brewery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> by using the <PERSON> Busch </PERSON> brand as a shield. But it might be difficult to maintain Budweiser's growth as <PERSON> Anheuser </PERSON> ventures more into the low-calorie beer market, <PERSON> MacDonough </PERSON> said. After the light beer market opened up, <PERSON> Anheuser </PERSON> made a stab with Natural Light, which has not taken off like its counterpart, Lite beer at <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>. But <PERSON> Anheuser </PERSON> introduced Bud Light in the early 1980s, and while the brand has not challenged <PERSON> Lite </PERSON> in terms of volume, its sales have had double-digit growth each of the past two years. <PERSON> MacDonough </PERSON> acknowledged that <PERSON> Anheuser </PERSON> officials were reluctant to enter the light beer market with the Budweiser name for fear that it would eat away Budweiser sales similar to what has happened at other companies. `` We do n't like to give people as good a head start as we gave <PERSON> Lite </PERSON>,'' he said. `` What's unusual is that we've gained that terrific growth -LRB- with Bud Light -RRB- and have still grown with Budweiser.'' One of the few areas where <PERSON> Anheuser </PERSON> has had problems is with its super-premium Michelob line, which, according to <ORGANIZATION> Goldman </ORGANIZATION>'s estimates, has lost an estimated 20 percent since the beginning of the decade But he noted Michelob sales probably were hurt by a strong dollar, which allowed imported beers to hold down their prices. Now that the dollar has weakened against other currencies, he said, <PERSON> Michelob </PERSON>'s erosion might subside. <PERSON> Anheuser </PERSON> also has had success selling its beer overseas through exporting and licensing agreements.

 The stock market held at sharply higher levels today after surging on a better-than-expected trade report that worked to ease inflation fears. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials was up 31.82 points to 2,131.22, its highest level since the October market crash, by midafternoon. Trading was active. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 170.23 million shares. Gainers led losers by about 3 to 1 with 1,133 up, 396 down and 405 unchanged at 2 p.m. on Wall Street. Stock prices surged at the opening on a long-awaited <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report which showed the nation's seasonally adjusted trade deficit narrowed to $ 9.89 billion in April, far below the $ 12-plus billion market watchers had been anticipating. It was the lowest trade imbalance since December 1984. The report also sparked a rally in the bond market, where the bellwether 30-year <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> issue was up more than $ 17 per $ 1,000 in face value at midday. The dollar also moved sharply higher against the major currencies. One trader said the market was `` feeding off the effect the -LRB- trade -RRB- number has on inflation.'' Analysts noted that the markets embraced the trade report because it showed a decline in exports, which eased by 2.5 percent and worked to dispel concerns that the economy is overheating. Imports declined by 6.4 percent in April. Last month, although the government's March deficit figures also were better than expected, a surge in both imports and exports replaced investors' enthusiasm with fears of inflation. `` If exports are surging, the economy is surging and inflation is surging,'' noted <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Wachtel </PERSON>, first vice president at <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The Dow had been flirting with the 2,100 mark for weeks. `` But we've broken out of that much-publicized resistance level,'' one trader said. Analysts noted that a lot of cash still remains on the sidelines. `` Portfolio managers are getting ` performance anxiety' fears because they've got a lot of cash,'' one trader noted `` A lot of it is going into bonds and equities.'' Among actively traded issues, <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> jumped 2 -RRB- to 119 -RRB-, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> was up 1 -RRB- at 52 -RCB-, <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION> was up 1 at 46 ~, and <ORGANIZATION> Motorola </ORGANIZATION> was up 1 \ at <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON>, a component of the Dow, was off 1 | at 83 -RRB-, and <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> was off 1 \ at 46 Tobacco stocks were expected to come under pressure after a jury in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> on Monday ordered a tobacco company to pay damages for the death of a smoker. <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> was up \ at 50 -RCB-. Traders were curious about who purchased a block of about 7.7 million <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> shares that traded hands early in the session. The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>'s composite index of all its listed common stocks rose 1.85 to 154.87. At the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the market value index was up 1.05 at 309.19.

 Share prices ended sharply higher Tuesday on the <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> following a surge on Wall Street that stemmed from a better-than-expected <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade report for April. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government said the trade deficit shrank to a seasonally adjusted $ 9.89 billion from a revised gap of $ 11.7 billion in March. The April shortfall was the lowest since December 1984 and about $ 3 billion down from what many economists had predicted. Wall Street fired ahead from the opening bell, with the closely watched <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrial average up about 30 points to the 2,129 level as the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> session neared its close. In response, the <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times-Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> 100-share index ended up 27.4 points, or 1.49 percent, at 1,866.2. Trading volume was a moderate 472.8 million shares, compared with Monday's 316.2 million. Brokers said dollar-dependent international issues were boosted by a stronger <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency. Among the few losers was Consolidated Gold Fields, which fell 10 pence to 10.48 pounds. Dealers said investors took profits and unloaded their shares as inflation worries began to evaporate.

<HEAD>Stocks and Dollar Jump, Interest Rates Drop In Response to Trade
Numbers</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Investors scooped up <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> securities and dollars Tuesday in response to a surprise plunge in the trade deficit that diluted inflation fears, depressed interest rates and sent the stock market to a post-crash high. `` I do n't think it's an overreaction. It's a very positive development,'' said <PERSON> Thom </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, chairman of the investment policy committee at the Philadelphia-based brokerage <ORGANIZATION> Butcher </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Singer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. A government report that the April trade deficit shrank to $ 9.89 billion startled many economists and investment strategists who had expected a much larger number The shrinkage reflected a big drop in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s appetite for imports and a lesser decline in exports, key concerns of those who fear the economy is too strong and much higher inflation is inevitable. The impact was immediately felt in the foreign-exchange markets, where surging demand for dollars strengthened the currency's value relative to the Japanese yen, West German mark and British pound. In the bond market, a sensitive barometer of the economy, prices of the 30-year <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bill soared more than $ 20 per $ 1,000 in face amount. Its yield, which moves inversely to price and is an important signal of interest rate trends, tumbled to 8.81 percent, its lowest level in two months. The bond-market rally overflowed into <LOCATION> Wall </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Street </LOCATION>, where stock prices advanced strongly and sent some key indices to their highest closing levels since the the October crash. Volume was heavy, an indication that more investors have been lured back to the market after a prolonged period of apathy and cynicism about stocks. `` The interesting thing I've seen today is that individual investors are calling to see what stocks we like,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Karos </PERSON>, manager of equity and over-the-counter trading at <ORGANIZATION> Piper </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jaffray </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Hopwood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>. `` That's the first time I've seen that for months It's very encouraging.'' Nevertheless, some strategists were cautious about interpreting the monthly trade number, which historically has been unpredictable and subject to major revisions. They said the markets were simply overlooking other evidence of impending inflation, such as higher commodity prices and low unemployment. `` I'm somewhat concerned overall because even though statistically we do n't see the kind of inflation we saw in the late 1970s, we're possibly building a fairly good springboard for inflation,'' said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Barbanel </PERSON>, a futures trader at <ORGANIZATION> Gruntal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` The market is ignoring it.'' <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Timbers </PERSON>, executive vice president and chief investment officer at <ORGANIZATION> Kemper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, said the trade deficit number showed definite improvement but he also expressed skepticism about its significance. `` We will undoubtedly have a disappointing figure in the next couple of months,'' he said. `` These numbers swing all over the place.'' Even some strategists who were more positive about the trade number saw some long-term danger lurking because it signaled a possible end to an economic boom in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, a key <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trading partner that largely relies on the American market for its export-oriented economy. If that happened, the roaring Japanese stock market could tumble, setting off a powerful reverberation through other markets worldwide, especially in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` I do n't think investors are paying any attention to this, which might come back and bite them,'' said <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> of Butcher & amp; Singer. `` The Japanese market is so grossly overvalued, it could come down fast and hard.''

<TEXT>
 The dollar leaped in value against most major foreign currencies Tuesday in reaction to a report that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> merchandise trade deficit narrowed in April to a better-than-expected $ 9.89 billion. Gold prices finished mixed after initially being knocked down by the trade news. <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> said gold was bid at $ 450.15 a troy ounce as of 4 p.m. EDT, up from $ 449.70 late Monday. In its strongest move in months, the dollar climbed 1.6 percent against the West German mark although <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s central bank sold dollars in an attempt to stem the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency's rise, traders said. The dollar also rose 1.7 percent against the British pound and by slightly less against other European currencies and the Japanese yen. It slipped against the Canadian dollar, in part because a strong bond rally lowered yields on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> securities in comparison to Canadian securities. Traders said there were no confirmed reports of dollar selling by central banks other than <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s. Many traders had expected the April merchandise trade deficit to be about $ 12.2 billion. Instead, the gap proved to be the lowest since December 1984. `` The statistics were quite a shock to the marketplace,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Witten </PERSON>, a vice president at <ORGANIZATION> Goldman </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sachs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Witten </PERSON> said some traders concluded the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would be able to trade its way out of its deficit, although he said, `` I think it's too early to say that. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s intervention briefly suppressed the dollar's rise, but the currency rebounded and finished the session at its highs of the day, said <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondschein </PERSON>, vice president and foreign exchange manager for <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Markets </ORGANIZATION> In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the dollar strengthened to $ 1.7925 to the pound from $ 1.8165 on Monday. Later in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the dollar strengthened to $ 1.7864 to the pound from $ 1.8165 late Monday. Before the announcement of the trade figures, the dollar closed at 125.05 Japanese yen in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, down from 125.19 Monday. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> the dollar traded at 126.20 yen. At the end of the trading day in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the dollar rose to 126.55 yen from 125.12 yen late Monday. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, compared with late Monday's rates, included: 1.7496 West German marks, up from 1.7227; 1.4626 Swiss francs, up from 1.4408; 1.2183 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2208; 1,297.50 Italian lire, up from 1,280.25; and 5.8970 French francs, up from 5.8125 Other late rates in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, compared with Monday's late rates, included: 1.7460 West German marks, up from 1.7241; 1.4615 Swiss francs, up from 1.4424; 5.8840 French francs, up from 5.7265; 1.9600 Dutch guilders, up from 1.9345; 1,292.50 Italian lire, up from 1,281.75; and 1.2162 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2203. Gold dropped about $ 4 an ounce immediately after the release of the trade numbers, but recovered toward the end of the day in reaction to strength in oil prices and commodity indexes, said <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Donohue </PERSON>, a trader for <ORGANIZATION> Midland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Montagu </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Metals </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, where the market closed before the release of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade numbers, gold closed at a bid $ 452.58, down from $ 457.99. The late gold bid price in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> was $ 448 a troy ounce, down from $ 449 an ounce late Monday. The late bid price in <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION> was also $ 448 an ounce, down from $ 448.50. On the Commodity Exchange in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, gold bullion for current delivery rose to $ 450.60 a troy ounce from $ 449.60 an ounce late Monday.

 Stocks hit a post-crash high Tuesday after rallying hard on a better-than-expected trade report, but a late wave of profit-taking prevented the market from posting even sharper gains. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, which had been up more than 38 points during the session, finished at 2,124.47, up 25.07. Broader market indices also closed at post-crash highs. Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 5 to 2 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed stocks, with 1,091 issues up, 432 down and 466 unchanged. Volume on the floor of the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> came to 227.15 million shares, up sharply from 125.31 million in the previous session. Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trading at regional exchanges and on the over-the-counter market, totaled 261.597 million shares. Analysts were impressed with the market's performance. `` It was a good show, and the best is yet to come,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Metz </PERSON>, a vice president and technical analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Oppenheimer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, noting that `` there's still room on the upside.'' Stock prices surged at the opening on a long-awaited <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> report that showed the nation's seasonally adjusted trade deficit narrowed to $ 9.89 billion in April, far below the $ 12-plus billion market watchers had been anticipating. The report also sparked a rally in the bond market and helped push the dollar higher against the major currencies. Analysts noted that the markets embraced the trade report because it showed a decline in exports, which eased by 2.5 percent and worked to dispel concerns that the economy is expanding too quickly. Imports declined by 6.4 percent in April. `` The trade figures suggest the consumer boom is slackening but manufacturing activity is rising, which is ideal,'' said <PERSON> Metz </PERSON>, who predicted `` a soft landing from fears of inflation and an overheated economy.'' The Dow average, which had been flirting with the 2,100 mark for weeks, decisively pierced that point at the opening, and traders watched closely as the key index ticked past incremental barriers. The buying spree was broad-based throughout the session. `` The blue chips basked in all this strength, but there is greater growth and percentage opportunities in the medium-capitalization stocks, and they also performed well,'' noted <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Peroni </PERSON>, a technical analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Janney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Montgomery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scott </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>. While cash that had been sitting on the sidelines for weeks poured into the market, analysts noted that the enthusiasm had some bounds. `` There's still a lot of skeptics in the background, which is a bullish phenomenon in and of itself,'' <PERSON> Metz </PERSON> said. Among actively traded issues, <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> rose 1 -RCB- to 118 -RCB-, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> was up 1 -LRB- at 52 -LCB-, <PERSON> Matsushita </PERSON> was up 3 | at 211 -LRB-, <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> was up 2 ~ at 90, and <ORGANIZATION> Digital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Equipment </ORGANIZATION> was up 1 -RRB- at 113 <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> was off 1 -RCB- at 83 \, and <ORGANIZATION> RJR </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nabisco </ORGANIZATION> was off 1 at 47 Tobacco stocks were expected to come under pressure after a jury in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> on Monday ordered a tobacco company to pay damages for the death of a smoker. <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> was down -LRB- at 50 -RRB-.

 The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit shrank to $ 9.89 billion in April, its best showing in more than three years, the government said Tuesday in a better-than-expected report which sparked a big rally on Wall Street. The <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said that the April deficit narrowed by 15.5 percent from a seasonally adjusted March deficit figure of $ 11.70 billion, with all of the improvement coming from a steep drop in imports. The trade figure, which has often rattled world financial markets, was greeted as exceptionally good news by investors, who rushed to bid up the price of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> stocks and bonds. They also sent the value of the dollar surging on foreign exchange markets. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials jumped 25.07 points to close at 2,124.47, a post-crash high. Many economists had been braced for a widening of the deficit to around $ 12.2 billion based on an assumption that exports could not hold at the record level set in March. Exports did edge down by 2.5 percent, but the small drop still left them at $ 26.22 billion, the second highest level on record. Meanwhile, imports plunged 6.4 percent to $ 36.11 billion, reflecting big drops in American purchases of foreign cars and capital equipment, including computers. Private analysts said the string of better trade numbers virtually assured that President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> would win his veto battle with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> over trade legislation. `` The argument for protectionism is fast disappearing as our trade deficit improves,'' said <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> McCormick </PERSON>, senior economist with <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>. For the first four months of the year, the trade deficit has been running at an annual rate of $ 141.8 billion, a big improvement from the record $ 170.3 billion deficit suffered in 1987. While many economists had been expecting a decline to around $ 150 billion, some said they were now revising their forecasts to show even more of an improvement this year. <PERSON> Zaharo </PERSON> <PERSON> Sofianou </PERSON>, senior economist for the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Economic Advisers, said she believed the trade deficit would dip to between $ 130 billion and $ 140 billion this year as exports continue to lead overall <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic growth For the past year, American manufacturers have been enjoying an export boom as a weaker dollar has made their products competitive again on overseas markets. The trade report came at a particularly good time for President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, who will depart Sunday for his eighth and final economic summit in <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION>. The administration hopes to use the summit as a forum to promote <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s free-market philosophy and cement gains made in the past three years on closer international cooperation. The April improvement gave the country its first single-digit trade deficit since a $ 9.90 billion imbalance in August 1985. It was the lowest imbalance since an $ 8.03 billion deficit in December 1984. The March deficit was originally reported as a single-digit figure as well at $ 9.7 billion. But that was before the department made adjustments for normal seasonal fluctuations. Beginning with the April report, these adjustments will be made on a monthly basis in an effort to smooth out erratic month-to-month swings which have often sent financial markets into a tailspin. A higher-than-expected February report sent the dollar plunging and pushed the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrial average down by 101 points, its fifth worst loss ever, and bad trade numbers last fall were blamed for contributing to market anxiety before the Oct. 19 stock market crash. The April improvement in imports reflected an 8 percent drop in foreign purchases of capital goods, including computers. Shipments of foreign cars and parts fell 4.6 percent while purchases of other foreign consumer goods dropped 7 percent. `` I think we have reached the high-water mark on imports and we will see gradual declines from now on,'' said <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Jasinowski </PERSON>, chief economist of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION>. Oil imports rose in April by 3.5 percent to $ 3.35 billion. The 2.5 percent drop in exports represented small declines in a number of areas which were offset in part by a 0.5 percent rise in food sales, which climbed to $ 2.59 billion. The country's largest trade deficit, as usual, was with <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, an imbalance of $ 4.44 billion, down slightly from a March deficit of $ 4.55 billion. The trade deficit with <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> continued to decline, dropping to $ 812.3 million in April. The deficit with <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s largest trading partner, edged down to $ 1.08 billion, compared to $ 1.14 billion in March. The country-by-country totals, unlike the other figures, are not adjusted for seasonal variations. Before adjusting for seasonal factors, the April trade deficit would have been $ 9.78 billion, 1.1 percent below the seasonally adjusted figure of $ 9.89 billion.

<HEAD>Trade Deficit Shrinks, Markets Rally, Auto Sales Down</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Financial markets rallied powerfully Tuesday in response to a stunning drop in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> monthly trade deficit, oil prices rose after <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> extended a production pact, and American automakers reported lower sales for early June. The biggest economic news was the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s report that the April trade deficit shrank to $ 9.89 billion, the best showing in more than three years. Many economists had expected a wider deficit, assuming exports would not not sustain high levels and imports would surge. But exports declined only slightly and imports plunged, dampening fears that the economy is growing too rapidly and acute inflation is inevitable. The news was greeted enthusiastically in the dollar, bond and stock markets. The dollar leaped in value against most major foreign currencies, rising 1.7 percent against the British pound, 1.6 percent against the West German mark and 1.1 percent against the Japanese yen. In the bond market, a sensitive barometer of interest rates, the key 30-year <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> issue jumped more than $ 20 per $ 1,000 in face amount and its yield fell to 8.81 percent, the lowest point in two months. The bond rally spilled into stocks, where prices surged and the key <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrial average rose 25.07 points to 2,124.47, its highest close since the October crash. Broader market barometers also hit post-crash highs. Elsewhere, oil prices rose after the <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exporting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Countries </ORGANIZATION> decided to prolong an output-restraint pact until the end of the year. On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the July contract for <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intermediate </ORGANIZATION>, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> benchmark crude oil, rose 40 cents to settle at $ 16.83 per 42-gallon barrel. In other economic news, major automakers said sales of domestically built cars and light trucks fell 4.1 percent in early June from last year's levels for the same period. But industry analysts attributed the decline largely to buying incentives last year that inflated sales. They said that 1988 spring sales have held steady and consumer confidence remains strong. Car sales were down for all domestic makers except <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which was just beginning <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> production last year, and <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which began <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> production in September.

<HEAD>Corn Futures Soar On Drought-Damage Fears</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Corn futures prices soared the maximum allowed for daily trading Tuesday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> as long-range weather forecasts fanned fears of drought damage to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corn crop. Other grain and soybean futures also advanced. On other markets, energy futures posted steep gains; <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bond futures and stock-index futures rose sharply; livestock and meat were lower; copper plunged; and precious metals rose. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>'s forecast for warmer - and drier-than-normal conditions in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION> through mid-July was the main factor driving corn prices higher, analysts said Until this week, the dramatic rise in corn futures prices was mainly speculative since a soaking rain could have restored almost all of the crop to full health. But the lack of moisture has now begun taking a real toll on the corn crop, despite scattered showers Tuesday in parts of <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Katharina </PERSON> <PERSON> Zimmer </PERSON>, a wheat and corn analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Markets </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` Everybody knows that this is the week when we start doing damage to the corn crops in many important growing areas,'' she said. `` This is the week when we really start taking off bushels.'' Contracts for delivery of corn in July, September, December and March all advanced their daily limit of 10 cents a bushel. The oat and spring wheat crops have already sustained severe drought damage and experts say the soybean crop will suffer if the dry spell continues into July. Wheat settled 1 -LCB- cents to 6 cents higher with the contract for delivery in July at $ 3.74 a bushel; corn was 3 -LCB- cents to 10 cents higher with July at $ 2.69 -LCB- a bushel; oats were 2 cents lower to 7 \ cents higher with July at $ 2.69 \ a bushel; soybeans were unchanged to 14 -LCB- cents higher with July at $ 8.90 a Oil futures surged following reports that <ORGANIZATION> OPEC </ORGANIZATION> ministers had agreed to extend their existing oil output pact for six months, but some analysts were at a loss to explain the market's reaction. Futures prices had fallen sharply during the past week in anticipation of just such an agreement. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Beutel </PERSON>, an analyst in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> with <ORGANIZATION> Elders </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said he did n't know whether the jump in prices signaled a major turnaround in market sentiment or was merely an upward blip in a downward trend. `` I feel a little like a detective who knows there's a dead body here and who's looking for a murder weapon and a motive,'' he said. West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 38 cents to 42 cents higher with July at $ 16.83 cents a barrel; heating oil was .55 cent to .59 cent higher with July at 44.32 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .88 cent to 1.13 cents higher with July at 49.53 cents a gallon. The government's report of an unexpected narrowing of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit to $ 9.89 billion gave <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bond futures a boost on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>. The dollar's stronger showing against other major currencies also supported <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bond futures, analysts said. June Treasury bonds settled 1 29-32 higher at 90 16-32. Stock-index futures markets also registered optimism in the wake of the trade-deficit report. The contract for June delivery of the <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's 500 index on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> settled 2.90 points higher at 274.60. Pork futures retreated on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> _ with frozen pork bellies down sharply for the sixth straight day _ on slack retail demand for pork products, low cash hog prices and concerns about abundant supplies of pork bellies in cold storage, analysts said. Live cattle futures were mostly lower on weak cash markets. A sharper drop in feeder cattle futures prices reflected concern about the rising cost of feed grains, said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Sterling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Arlington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heights </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>. Live cattle settled .27 cent lower to .20 cent higher with June at 71.80 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .65 cent to 1 cent lower with August at 73.27 cents a pound; hogs were 1.05 cents lower to .43 cent higher with June at 50.65 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were 1 cent to 1.88 cents lower with July at 46.47 cents a pound Copper futures prices fell steeply on the <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, reflecting improved availability of the metal, analysts said. Copper for June delivery settled 3.65 cents lower at $ 1.085 a pound. Gold and silver futures posted slight gains in reaction to higher grain and energy futures prices. Gold settled 20 cents to $ 1 higher with August at $ 454.60 a troy ounce; silver was 0.6 cent to 1.5 cents higher with July at $ 7.07 a troy ounce.

 Federal prosecutors are seeking a `` substantial'' prison sentence for the former head of <ORGANIZATION> Beech-Nut </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, who was convicted of distributing phony apple juice for babies, according to court papers filed Tuesday. Former Beech-Nut Chief Executive <PERSON> Neils </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoyvald </PERSON>, 54, was found guilty in February of 351 counts of violating the Food, Drug and Cosmetic Act. Each count carries a maximum sentence of three years in prison and a $ 10,000 fine. He and his co-defendant, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Lavery </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Beech-Nut </ORGANIZATION> vice president, are scheduled for sentencing Thursday in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>. The government has urged <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Platt </PERSON> to impose a `` substantial'' prison sentence for <PERSON> Hoyvald </PERSON> because he has not shown remorse and because he allegedly gave false testimony, according to a response letter from <PERSON> Hoyvald </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Brendan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, who said the arguments had no merit. Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Roche </PERSON> said the government's pre-sentencing memorandum would not be made public until the day of sentencing <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> has asked that <PERSON> Hoyvald </PERSON> be spared a prison term and that he instead receive probation and community service or home detention. In his pre-sentencing memo, <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> suggested that <PERSON> Hoyvald </PERSON> could lecture to business students so they could learn from his mistakes. `` Mr. <PERSON> Hoyvald </PERSON> has been branded as a convicted felon and will bear the stigma of his convictions for as long as he lives,'' <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said in his letter. `` This prosecution has already ` sent a message' to the food industry that economic adulteration will not be overlooked and may result in criminal liability.'' Hoyvald and <PERSON> Lavery </PERSON> were charged in an indictment that accused Beech-Nut of shipping adulterated and misbranded juice made from phony concentrate throughout the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and overseas from 1978 to 1983. The juice, labeled 100 percent apple juice for babies, was actually made from a flavored concentrate that had little or no apple juice, prosecutors charged. There has been no evidence that the phony juice caused any health problems. Beech-Nut, the corporation, pleaded guilty in November to 215 counts of violating federal food and drug laws and agreed to pay a $ 2 million fine. <PERSON> Lavery </PERSON>, who oversaw the upstate manufacturing where the juice was made, was convicted conspiracy, 18 counts of mail fraud and 429 counts of violating federal food and drug laws. <ORGANIZATION> Beech-Nut </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, is a subsidiary of <ORGANIZATION> Nestle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> S.A. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>.

 <ORGANIZATION> Eastman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday introduced a line of batteries that are designed to last longer in cameras and other photographic equipment, a company spokesman said. <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> also introduced two new cameras, including an $ 11.95 model for young children called the `` Mickey-Matic,'' and two new color slide films. The line of `` Photolife'' alkaline batteries was made to perform best in devices such as point-and-shoot 35 mm cameras and flash attachments that frequently demand short, repeated bursts of energy. `` We have created these premium, high-performance energy cells to meet the special demands of picture-taking consumers,'' said <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON>, vice president for marketing of <ORGANIZATION> Ultra </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technologies </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary that oversees the battery business. The batteries come in either AA-size or AAA-size and will be available in September. <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> has been struggling to gain a share of the market that is dominated by <ORGANIZATION> Duracell </ORGANIZATION> and Eveready. <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> is not the first to launch a special battery for a specific purpose. Several months ago, <ORGANIZATION> Eveready </ORGANIZATION> introduced a line of batteries called `` The Conductor'' which are designed for use in audio equipment, such as portable stereos. <ORGANIZATION> Duracell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the leader in the sale of AA and <ORGANIZATION> AAA </ORGANIZATION> batteries, has n't gotten into the specific-use market because its batteries perform `` as well or better'' than any other akaline battery in all categories, said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Donahue </PERSON>, a company spokesman. The other new <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> products announced Tuesday are: another easy-to-use 35 mm camera, at $ 89.95, to go with <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION>'s eight other 35 mm models released in the past two years; the `` Mickey-Matic,'' a 110-format camera; new Kodachrome film that is the first slide film available at 200 <ORGANIZATION> ISO </ORGANIZATION>; Ektachrome 100 HC film, which will provide more saturated colors in a versatile, general-purpose slide film.

 <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> will combine its two <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sales and importing companies into one July 1, eliminating 70 jobs at one of the companies' headquarters in <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION> is combining <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> into <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. About 20 of the 330 workers at the <LOCATION> Mazda </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> headquarters will be laid off by the end of June, <PERSON> Yoshinori </PERSON> <PERSON> Taura </PERSON>, president of the new <LOCATION> Irvine </LOCATION>, Calif.-based company, said In the next three to six months, 45 to 50 other <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION> workers will be laid off.

 <ORGANIZATION> Morton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> test-fired its redesigned solid fuel booster rocket Tuesday with no apparent problems in the second-to-last test before shuttle flights are to resume. `` All indications are we had an excellent test,'' said <PERSON> Royce </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, solid rocket program manager for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. `` Everything went smoothly. The motor performed very, very well.'' Brilliant yellow flame erupted from the 126-foot-long rocket and grayish-brown smoke billowed thousands of feet into the air amid a roar that could be heard for miles. The 122-second horizontal test, conducted at 1 p.m. MDT at <ORGANIZATION> Morton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION>'s Wasatch Operations plant west of here, was the fourth of five tests required to qualify major design features of the solid fuel booster before the shuttle program, grounded after the 1986 Challenger disaster, can resume. `` We've got a lot of work to do,'' said <PERSON> J.R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Marshall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flight </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Huntsville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION> `` Barring some surprise, I feel very good about'' an August launch. <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> McDonald </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Morton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION> vice president of engineering, said preliminary data indicated that the motor successfully withstood the simulated liftoff and flight stresses. `` From all aspects, we can say it was a totally successful test,'' <PERSON> McDonald </PERSON> said. `` I hope it looks as good from the inside as it does on the outside.'' `` It's an extremely good test,'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said. He said engineers will spend the next two days studying computer readouts of the test and disassembling the motor, and officials expect to have a complete analysis within two weeks. Fifteen minutes after the test, a nozzle exit cone toppled from the rear of the motor to simulate its separation from the motor during a flight. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> has scheduled an Aug. 31 launch of the shuttle Discovery. The booster tested Tuesday was free of planned flaws introduced in previous tests to determine whether the joint can withstand the intense heat and pressures of launch even in the event of some failures, <ORGANIZATION> Morton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Rocky </PERSON> <PERSON> Raab </PERSON> said. It also was the first use of a new $ 22 million test stand, which has 1,216 channels of instrumentation and uses hydraulic struts to duplicate steering, flight turbulence and other stresses the motor will endure during launch, he said. The building also can heat an entire motor to 110 degrees Fahrenheit or cool it to 20 degrees. The rocket's 1.1 million pounds of propellant has been heated to a uniform 90 degrees, or about 20 degrees warmer than the usual launch temperature, to allow engineers to test its performance at the upper limit for an actual launch, <PERSON> Raab </PERSON> said. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Ewing </PERSON>, deputy director of program management for <ORGANIZATION> Morton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION>, said the hydraulic struts that duplicate launch stresses are based on `` the worst-case sideloads'' experienced in past shuttle flights. During launch the boosters flex about 26 inches at the tip, creating a `` twang,'' he said. The test simulated those pressures on the rocket motor's joints. The Challenger explosion on Jan. 28, 1986, was blamed on a faulty booster joint that allowed a plume of superhot gas to snake through an O-ring, triggering the blast that killed the seven crew members. The new joint incorporates three Viton O-rings instead of two, a metal lip to help hold the joint together and an adhesively bonded relief slot that reduces stresses and increases the sealing action of the bonded surface under pressure, <PERSON> Raab </PERSON> said. Moreover, the rocket's three field joints are equipped with heaters to maintain a minimum temperature of 75 degrees Fahrenheit. Sub-freezing temperatures the night before the doomed Challenger launch were found to have contributed to the failure of the joint. For the experiment simulating the nozzle exit cone's separation during flight, the test device was fitted with an explosive severance system activated 15 minutes after the test. Dozens of visitors from Chicago-based <ORGANIZATION> Morton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> and various subcontractors were at the remote desert plant to watch Tuesday's test. The final full-scale test is scheduled for some time in July. At that time, severe flaws will be introduced in the joints `` to test the system to its limits,'' <PERSON> Raab </PERSON> said. Testing of the redesigned motor has gone so well, he said, that Discovery's two boosters were hooked up Friday with an external fuel tank at <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canaveral </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, and the stack was to be joined with the shuttle Thursday.

<HEAD>Suit Accuses Suzuki Of RICO Violations with Samurai Trucks</HEAD>

 A lawsuit filed Tuesday accused <ORGANIZATION> Suzuki </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of violating federal racketeering laws by fraudulently promoting its sporty Samurai vehicles as safe. The class-action suit alleged <PERSON> Suzuki </PERSON> and the firms handling the company's public relations and advertising routinely committed mail and wire fraud and conspiracy to conceal the Samurai's dangers, violating the federal Racketeering Influenced, Corrupt Organizations Act. The suit filed by Dr. <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Kay </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Wynnewood </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, on behalf of all Samurai owners not employed by <PERSON> Suzuki </PERSON> seeks unspecified punitive and compensatory damages from the defendants. <PERSON> Suzuki </PERSON> has been defending itself vehemently against a call by <ORGANIZATION> Consumers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, publisher of Consumer Reports magazine, for a ban of the vehicles on the grounds that they tend to roll over in sudden turns. The suit, filed in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, contended the defendants were `` aware the vehicles were not safe but instead were by design and construction dangerous and unsuitable for on - or off-road use and that advertising and other sales representations were false and misleading. <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> <PERSON> Segall </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for <PERSON> Suzuki </PERSON> and an employee of the defendant public relations firm <ORGANIZATION> Rogers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>, would not comment on the suit because she had not seen it. `` The bottom line we've said for the last 10 days is that it's safe and stable,'' Ms. <PERSON> Segall </PERSON> said Tuesday Consumers Union said June 2 that the $ 8,500 Samurai was the first car out of 349 it had tested in the last decade to roll over during a routine accident-avoidance test, in which cars swerve to avoid a road obstacle. <PERSON> Suzuki </PERSON> said 300-pound outriggers attached to the trucks to prevent them from rolling over completely during the tests had contributed to the results. The company also partially blamed the driver's actions for causing the vehicle to tip up on two wheels during the test. <PERSON> Suzuki </PERSON> says the Samurai was tested thoroughly for safety, stability and handling before it was introduced in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in November 1985. <PERSON> Suzuki </PERSON> sold 154,675 Samurais through April. The lawsuit cites <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Traffic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Highway </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> figures indicating at least 44 Samurai rollover accidents resulted in at least 53 injuries and 16 deaths. In addition to the <ORGANIZATION> Consumers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> claims, the suit cites the Center for Auto Safety's February petition to the federal government to order a Samurai recall. <ORGANIZATION> Suzuki </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Ltd. of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Suzuki </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>, of <LOCATION> Brea </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Rogers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>, of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>; and <PERSON> Keye-Donna-Pearlstein </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> advertising firm, are named as defendants

<HEAD>Ruling Party Outlined Proposal For Tax Reform</HEAD>

 The ruling <ORGANIZATION> Liberal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> approved a blueprint for sweeping reform of the national tax system on Tuesday, and pegged a controversial consumer sales tax at 3 percent, party officials said. The <ORGANIZATION> LDP </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Tax </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> completed the final plan that could pave the way for the first major overhaul of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s postwar tax system The <ORGANIZATION> LDP </ORGANIZATION> draft includes some $ 44.8 billion in tax cuts. Corporate and personal income tax rates as well as inheritance levies will be cut in the new tax plan, which <ORGANIZATION> LDP </ORGANIZATION> officials say they hope to implement by April 1989. `` It took six months for us only to agree on the sales tax rate,'' said <PERSON> Sadanori </PERSON> <PERSON> Yamanaka </PERSON>, the legislator who heads the council. `` Now, the party must be firmly united under the new plan to overcome the opposition parties' attempt to block the bill.'' The new tax plan caps long and fiercely-debated sessions regarding the amount of tax reductions and the level of sales taxes among ruling party members and finance ministry officials. But it also is expected to come under hot debate from opposition parties in the upcoming session of the Diet, the Japanese parliament. The new plan finalized Tuesday marks the third attempt by the government and ruling party to introduce an indirect tax, following others in 1979 and 1987. Last year, then-Prime Minister <PERSON> Yasuhiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON> suffered a serious political setback when his party was defeated in local elections over the sales tax issue. <PERSON> Shintaro </PERSON> <PERSON> Abe </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> LDP </ORGANIZATION> secretary general, said after unveiling the new tax plan that the party still faced the task of garnering wide support for the reform package. `` We have just completed the first stage,'' he said. `` The next steps are going to be the real challenge, but I think there is a consensus within the party.'' Opposition party leaders denounced the ruling party's decision to push forward with the once-defeated tax reform plan. `` It is a serious challenge to the people of our country,'' said <PERSON> Shizuo </PERSON> <PERSON> Yamaguchi </PERSON>, secretary general of the <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, the largest opposition party. `` The <ORGANIZATION> LDP </ORGANIZATION> must dissolve the Diet and let the people decide on the issue.'' <PERSON> Satsuki </PERSON> <PERSON> Eda </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` I am determined to cooperate with other opposition parties to block the passage of the new tax law in the Diet by all means.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> _ which had sought a 5 percent sales tax _ also welcomed the new tax system as a boost to the domestic economy. `` The new tax system is expected to lift the gross national product by 0.1 percent,'' said a <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> official. As a result, `` the Japanese economy will be vitalized and expanded domestic demand will draw more imports.'' <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> officials have argued that revenue from a 3 percent sales tax would total only about $ 40 billion to $ 43 billion, short of the amount slated in tax cuts. The ministry has said it hopes to eliminate budget deficit-covering bond issues by fiscal 1990, but may have to revise its target if the new <ORGANIZATION> LDP </ORGANIZATION> plan is passed. An <ORGANIZATION> LDP </ORGANIZATION> official said the tax plan will be presented to the Diet in July for passage by next fall.
