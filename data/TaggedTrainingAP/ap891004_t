 The captain of the USS Iowa and three subordinates were charged with dereliction of duty for violating administrative procedures aboard the battleship on which 47 men were killed in an explosion, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday. The actions against the four men, ranging from `` administrative corrective measures to punitive letters of admonition,'' resulted from admiral's mast hearings conducted earlier this week on board the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> by Vice Adm. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Donnell </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>. None of the men was relieved of his duties. `` Each person was charged with a dereliction of duty under the Uniform Code of <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> as a result of administrative deficiencies found in the <LOCATION> USS </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> investigation,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> said. Despite violations of procedure, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> said, `` None of the discrepancies resulted in or contributed to the explosion'' on April 19. A <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> investigation concluded that gunner's mate <PERSON> Clayton </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON> `` most likely'' caused the explosion in the battleship's No 2 gun turret by inserting a detonator between two powder bags. The report, which has come under congressional scrutiny, turned up numerous lax procedures, including experimentation with extra-strength gunpower and projectile loads, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> said. Those allegations prompted the admiral's mast hearings. As a result of the hearings, Capt. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Moosally </PERSON>, commander of the battleship and the only man publicly identified by the service, and his operations officer, Cmdr. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Finney </PERSON>, were subject to `` administrative corrective measures,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> said. <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> sources identified <PERSON> Finney </PERSON> and the other two men cited in hearings. A <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said <PERSON> Moosally </PERSON> and <PERSON> Finney </PERSON> will not have letters that affect their potential promotions placed in their files, although they will be given the letters. However, the source said their annual fitness reports will reflect the problems on the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and their careers are likely to be damaged. Stiffer disciplinary action was given to the weapons officer and the fire control gunner, who were given punitive letters of admonition. The weapons officer was fined $ 2,000 and the gunner $ 1,000, but the fines were forgiven. The weapons control officer has been identified as Cmdr. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON>, while the gunner was Master Chief Petty Officer <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Skelly </PERSON>. The service said the action against <PERSON> Moosally </PERSON> was less severe because `` subordinates were held accountable for deficiencies in their specifically assigned duties.'' <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kubicina </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Hartwig </PERSON>'s sister, said she was not surprised by the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> action. `` They got merely a slap on the wrists. If they would have gotten something harsher, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> would have had to admit their own guilt. I was prepared for this, which is absolutely nothing,'' she said. <PERSON> Donnell </PERSON> based his punishment on what he concluded was appropriate for each person, the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> said, insisting that the administrative deficiencies had nothing to do with the explosion. `` It should be stressed that although deficiencies in the <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>'s training documentation, weapons handling requirements and adherence to safety procedures were found within the weapons department, the investigation determined that these shortcomings did not cause or contribute to the explosion,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement In deciding on the punishments, <PERSON> Donnell </PERSON> was `` required to separate the larger tragedy from the process of determining accountability for administrative training, safety and ordnance-handling deficiencies,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> said. All four men can appeal for a review of the actions.

<TEXT>
 Health officials are blaming contaminated food for an outbreak of salmonella poisoning that killed seven residents of a geriatric hospital and sickened 160 others. The preliminary findings released Wednesday by <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s public hospital authority indicated food preparation at the <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Richet </PERSON> hospital in suburban Cergy <LOCATION> Pontoise </LOCATION> was not the cause of the outbreak. Salmonella poisoning struck nearly one quarter of the hospital's 670 patients shortly after a Sept. 28 dinner of a soup including ground beef, followed by an omelette, with rice pudding for dessert Since Friday, two women and five men aged 85 to 93 have died from food poisoning. The remaining 160 infected patients are not in life-threatening danger, the health authority said in a statement. Residents at the hospital are long-term patients suffering serious illness or handicaps, the health authority said. An investigation conducted by the <ORGANIZATION> Pasteur </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> will attempt to pinpoint the exact cause of the poisoning, the health authority said. The results will not be known for several days. The mass poisoning is the second in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> in three months. Nine patients at a retirement home at <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rochelle </LOCATION> in western <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> died over a one-month period after eating salmonella-infected rice pudding July 9. There were 6,000 reported cases of salmonella poisoning in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> during 1988, health officials said.

 One of two men who bombed three abortion facilities here on Christmas Day 1984 is free and the other is scheduled to be paroled next month, federal officials said Wednesday. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> and <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldsby </PERSON>, both 26 and from the Cantonment community north of <LOCATION> Pensacola </LOCATION>, have served about half of the 10-year prison sentences they received for the Christmas Day bombings. The bombings in this <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Panhandle </LOCATION> city, followed by three more in the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, area the next week, refocused national attention on the abortion issue. <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> was transferred from the <ORGANIZATION> Tallahassee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Correctional </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION> to a work-release program in <LOCATION> Pensacola </LOCATION> a couple months ago. He was released from there 59 days early on Sept. 25 under the federal curfew parole program, said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Kowalski </PERSON>, regional administrator for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parole </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. Although free, he must observe a curfew until his regular parole date of Nov. 28, <PERSON> Kowalski </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Goldsby </PERSON> is scheduled for release Nov. 21. His initial release date was May 21, 1990, but <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Rast </PERSON>, the regional parole commissioner, moved it up two years ago because <PERSON> Goldsby </PERSON> was credited with superior program achievement, which could include good conduct, work performance and educational advancement. <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>, a glass company employee, and <PERSON> Goldsby </PERSON>, a construction worker, were convicted of planting homemade pipe bombs at a clinic and two doctors' offices where abortions were performed. The building in which one office was located was demolished by the explosion and ensuing fire and the other office was seriously damaged. Damage at the clinic, The Ladies Center, was less severe and it soon reopened, becoming the target of numerous anti-abortion demonstrations. One doctor at the bombed-out clinic retired and the other discontinued abortions because insurance companies refused to cover his new office, fearing it also might be attacked as long as he continued that part of his practice. <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>' wife, <PERSON> Kathren </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Goldsby </PERSON>'s former fiance, <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> <PERSON> Wiggins </PERSON>, were convicted on conspiracy charges and placed on probation. All four had attended the <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> God </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Pensacola </LOCATION> and said the two men were driven by religious conviction. Feminist leaders criticized the sentences are being too lenient to begin with. The terms were the shortest given to people convicted of bombing or torching abortion clinics up to that time. The case drew wide public attention when it went to trial in April 1985 with defense lawyers portraying their clients as idealistic `` knights in shining armor'' or `` <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Sawyer </PERSON> and <PERSON> Huck </PERSON> <PERSON> Finn </PERSON>.''

<TEXT>
 Thousands of ethnic Turks line up daily at the Turkish Embassy in <LOCATION> Sofia </LOCATION>, besieging officials for visas to enter <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>. But about 20,000 who got visas in past months have come back, unable to find good jobs or housing in <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>. The Turks have been fleeing a sometimes-violent campaign by Bulgarian authorities, going back to 1984, to force them to use Bulgarian names, curtail their Moslem religious rites and stop speaking Turkish in public. Diplomats in <LOCATION> Sofia </LOCATION> say many of the Turks who have returned face prosecution, although they have no details of such cases. They also say the Turks often are forbidden to return to their previous jobs and homes, partly due to an acute labor shortage in some areas that has prompted authorities to shift manual labor to crucial construction projects and industries. The official Bulgarian news agency, <ORGANIZATION> BTA </ORGANIZATION>, has reported the return rate at 500 to 1,000 a day. A Turkish diplomat in <LOCATION> Sofia </LOCATION> said, however, that ethnic <PERSON> Turks </PERSON> `` still want to leave <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> as vigorously as before.'' `` You can see for yourself. There are some 2,000 people waiting around our consulate every day,'' he said. About 320,000 of <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>'s 1.5 million ethnic Turks began in mid-year to leave for <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> deported some of them. Others emigrated under new liberalized passport regulations. Many had their possessions seized before leaving, and their arrival strained Turkish abilities to absorb them. On Aug. 22, Premier <PERSON> Turgut </PERSON> <PERSON> Ozal </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> closed the border to the ethnic Turks, requiring them to obtain regular visas. His move, part of an attempt to persuade <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> to safeguard the property of those seeking to settle in <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>, was widely seen as a diplomatic victory for <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>'s Communist government over <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>, which had asserted at one point that it would welcome any Bulgarian Turk facing persecution. Now that <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> is no longer absorbing large new groups of ethnic Turks, the situation of people wanting to emigrate has become even more precarious. About 25,000 would-be emigrants are stranded in <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>. Most have sold their houses and other belongings. A Turkish diplomat said his mission now is to issue visas only for family reunification and other urgent case. `` In all, we are interviewing about 800 people a day,'' he said. Only a handful, perhaps a dozen or so, receive visas each day. `` With the numbers we have given out for visa applicants, we are already in the mid-1990s,'' he said of a waiting list for interviews. Long lines reportedly also have formed outside the Turkish consulates in <LOCATION> Varna </LOCATION> on the <LOCATION> Black </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> and the southern industrial town of <LOCATION> Plovdiv </LOCATION>. Several diplomats in <LOCATION> Sofia </LOCATION> asserted that 500,000 more ethnic Turks may want to emigrate to <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>. But <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> continues to balk at a new emigration accord with <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> that would set out in detail such things as property rights and social security claims. `` Such a new immigration agreement would limit the free movement of our people under the <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION> accords'' on human rights, said <PERSON> Chavdar </PERSON> <PERSON> Mladenov </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> has come under heavy Western criticism over the issue. Officially, <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> has stopped referring to a Turkish minority in the country. Officials and newspapers now invariably speak of `` Bulgarian Moslems.'' <PERSON> Maldenov </PERSON> asserted flatly that there are no Turks in <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>. Turks indeed have left some of the villages in the <LOCATION> Razgrad </LOCATION> area, 270 miles northeast of <LOCATION> Sofia </LOCATION>. `` Of 400 families, 300 left'' for <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>, said one of the handful of farmers in one village. In <LOCATION> Mortagonovo </LOCATION>, another predominantly Turkish village, a frail man in his late 70s sat on a bench, his prayer beads gliding through his fingers. He was asked if he planned to leave. `` I was waiting in a camp down south for 15 days. Then they closed the border,'' he said in halting Bulgarian. `` I sold my house before I left. Now I'm staying with my son.''

<TEXT>
 Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> was asked over lunch with foreign journalists how she'd run a political campaign against <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>. Her reply: `` I would n't. I'd vote for her.'' This instant response on Wednesday showed the <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> prime minister in full, combative cry as she goes into the 1989-90 political season, with three consecutive election victories behind her and every indication she will go for a fourth. Autumn in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> means the annual party conventions, where political leaders take stock of the year and promise victory next time. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s Conservatives convene next week. The opposition <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> is halfway through its convention, buoyed by opinion poll leads and a conviction that after a decade of Thatcherism, the British are ready for a change. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> obviously disagrees, but she does so with the zeal and enthusiasm of a first-time candidate rather than a senior stateswoman who turns 64 this month and is the longest-serving leader of a Western democracy. She has been to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and talked to farmers who ca n't get permits for equipment to grow crops. Last month she was in <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION>, watching Soviets selling vodka to her press party, strictly for hard currency. She had her sixth meeting with <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and was struck once again, she says, by the enormous risks of switching rapidly from communism to a free market. Her conclusion is characteristically simple: `` There is no revision, refashioning or reform of socialism that is possible. There's only rejection of it.'' This unwavering conviction that she is right is a Thatcher hallmark, and any suggestion of second thoughts is quickly slapped down. Lately, attempts are being made to penetrate the <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> mystique through long-distance psychoanalysis. <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> Abse </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> lawmaker, has just published a 288-page book whose central thesis is that Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> suffers from narcissism caused by an unloving mother. On Wednesday, The Independent newspaper said Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> plans to block her official residence with 10-foot-high railings. It said psychiatrists believed it was a sign of the stress caused by 10 years at the helm. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> probably would scoff at such notions. She believes she simply represents basic human instincts. `` Thatcherism is a lot older than me,'' she said. Referring to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s bumpy passage into the brotherhood of European nations, she said she merely wanted to make sure the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> followed Thatcherite principles, namely not to tie free enterprise down in bureaucracy. `` Because we approached the whole of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> in the same way as we do at home, we do n't wish it to be tied up with unnecessary regulations,'' she said. Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> likes to illustrate her points with mundane examples, like the Polish farmers last year. She had asked them why they could n't grow enough food. They told her it was because of the difficulty in obtaining farming equipment from officials. `` And then it suddenly dawned on me,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON> said, `` that it is the whole network of intricate controls which will stop people from being able to make maximum use of their property.''

 A B-1B bomber with crippled landing gear flew halfway across the continent Wednesday and made a successful touchdown on the <LOCATION> Mojave </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Desert </LOCATION> lake bed where the space shuttle lands. The $ 280 million aircraft, with its four-member crew unable to unlock its nose landing gear, refueled in the air and landed at 6:15 p.m. after 11 -LCB- hours in the air that began as a training flight in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. The big bomber trailed a plume of dust as it rolled down the 12-mile-long runway after touchdown, slowly lowering onto its nose. `` There were no injuries,'' said Tech. Sgt. <PERSON> Donn </PERSON> <PERSON> Clarius </PERSON>, a spokesman at <ORGANIZATION> Edwards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>. `` The flight crew came out just fine. `` There was no fire or explosion or anything.'' He said the bomber suffered some damage, which was being assessed by ground crews as darkness fell. <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Punter </PERSON>, an aerospace buff who monitors military frequencies from his home in <LOCATION> Lancaster </LOCATION>, listened to radio traffic between the pilots and controllers. Just before touching down the pilot said, `` It's been a great day for flying, except for a few glitches,'' Punter reported. Just after the landing, <PERSON> Punter </PERSON> said he heard the pilot say, `` It was real nice. Structure looking good.'' During the landing, the massive bomber skidded on its nose for more than half a minute, yet it did not break up. No flames were seen. `` It's one of the safest areas to land,'' said base spokeswoman <PERSON> Dottie </PERSON> <PERSON> Spiegelberg </PERSON>, adding that the hard clay surface means there are no sparks and minimizes the chance of explosion or fire. The aircraft, flying out of <ORGANIZATION> Dyess </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, was n't carrying bombs. `` There are no nuclear weapons,'' said Lt. <PERSON> Anu </PERSON> <PERSON> Sjaardema </PERSON>, an <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON> public affairs spokeswoman. An 18-unit disaster preparedness team was mobilized at <LOCATION> Edwards </LOCATION>, including explosives experts, a mortuary services officer, an environmental officer and fire department personnel, the lieutenant said. `` They route a lot of emergencies to our lake bed, both military and civilian. We have a team to respond to that all the time,'' said <PERSON> Sjaardema </PERSON>. The flight crew was Capt. <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Beene </PERSON>, 30, aircraft commander, of the 337th <ORGANIZATION> Bombardment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Squadron </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Dyess </LOCATION>; Capt. <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Benton </PERSON>, 30, co-pilot; Capt. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hendricks </PERSON>, 31, offensive systems officer and Lt. Col. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON>, 38, an instructor and offensive systems officer with the 338th <ORGANIZATION> Combat </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crew </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Training </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Squadron </ORGANIZATION>. The crippled plane was refueled by a tanker plane before flying to <PERSON> Edwards </PERSON>, about 1,200 miles away. The B-1B, with a maximum speed of 1,000 mph and range of more than 7,000 miles, is 147 feet long and 137 feet wide when its swing-wings are extended. It weighs 477,000 pounds when fully fueled and armed. Maj. <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Beth </PERSON> <PERSON> Kilgore </PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION> Dyess </ORGANIZATION> said the plane started circling <ORGANIZATION> Dyess </ORGANIZATION> at about 9:30 a.m. PDT. It left for <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> five hours later. Mechanics from <LOCATION> Dyess </LOCATION> and the plane's manufacturer, <ORGANIZATION> Rockwell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, worked with the plane's crew to try get the nose gear down. The plane's rear wheels were down while it circled <LOCATION> Dyess </LOCATION>, located at the western edge of <LOCATION> Abilene </LOCATION>, a city of 100,000 in west <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. The plane took off from <LOCATION> Dyess </LOCATION> at 6:38 a.m. PDT on a training mission. The plane was originally tested at <ORGANIZATION> Edwards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AFB </ORGANIZATION> and Ms. <PERSON> Kilgore </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Dyess </LOCATION> officials believed someone there could figure out the problem. <LOCATION> Dyess </LOCATION> is one of four bases in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> where B-1 bombers are stationed. In March 1986, the variable-sweep wings became stuck on the second production model of the B-1B during a training flight out of <ORGANIZATION> Dyess </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AFB </ORGANIZATION>. The pilots successfully made a high-speed landing at <LOCATION> Edwards </LOCATION> when the wings were swept back. The plane stopped after using 13,000 feet of runway. There have been three B-1B crashes and the crash of a B-1 prototype.

 <PERSON> Del </PERSON> <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>, The Grand Ole Opry's ragtime pianist whose 1951 recording of `` Down Yonder'' sold more than 3 million copies, died Tuesday at a <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION> hospital following a stroke. She was 69. Miss <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> became a member of the Opry in 1953 and was the only person regularly featured at the Grand Ole Opry keyboard. <PERSON> Minnie </PERSON> <PERSON> Pearl </PERSON> is the only woman who has been on the famous country music show longer than Miss Wood, said Opry spokesman <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Strobel </PERSON>. Miss <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> suffered a stroke last week and was in intensive care at <LOCATION> Baptist </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> until her death Tuesday night, said <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, a family friend. Known as `` The Queen of the Ivories,'' her real name was <PERSON> Adelaide </PERSON> <PERSON> Hazelwood </PERSON>. In an interview with the <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in 1984, she said she still practiced about three hours a week. `` I'd never go on the Opry without first doing a run-through. If I live to be 100, I'm going to do the best I can,'' she said. Grand Ole Opry star <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> <PERSON> Acuff </PERSON> said Miss <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> was a fine pianist. `` I do n't know of any we've had on the Opry better on the piano than she was. She made a very fine reputation for herself in country music,'' he said. Miss <PERSON> Wood </PERSON>'s parents gave her a piano on her fifth birthday and she was schooled in classical music until ragtime _ a jazz-influenced style of pop music _ became her passion as a teen-ager. `` Ragtime has so much get-up-and-go that it's infectious; it's part of our heritage,'' she said After graduating from high school in <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION>, she worked playing sheet music for customers at a dime store and as a payroll clerk for the state Health Department while pursuing her music career on weekends and at night. She cut a record featuring `` Mine All Mine,'' for RCA and with `` Down Yonder'' on the flip side. `` Down Yonder'' was second on the pop charts for 27 weeks and was also a country hit. Miss <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> also played five songs in the movie `` Rhinestone,'' which starred <PERSON> Dolly </PERSON> <PERSON> Parton </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sylvester </PERSON> <PERSON> Stallone </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 With his travels to <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, his peace initiatives and calls to forget the painful past, Pope <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON> has made unprecedented openings to the Moslem world. But the road to dialogue is dotted with obstacles, and the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> is keeping a wary eye on challenges to the church in Islamic countries. Over the past two decades, and especially during <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>'s 11-year pontificate, the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> has sought to erase the image of medieval crusades fought in the name of faith `` Moslems and Christians have generally understood each other badly and sometimes, in the past, have exhausted each other in polemics and wars,'' he said in <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION> four years ago as the first pontiff to set foot on Arab soil as an official state guest. He said dialogue was essential between the Catholic church and Islam, the two largest religious groups in the world. But the spread of Moslem fundamentalism has raised alarm, especially for isolated minority communities of Christians. The danger of Moslem-Christian rivalries has been dramatized by the bloodshed in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The pope's concern over the <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> fighting recently led him to make the first direct appeal by a pontiff to the Islamic world, saying there can be no winners in such a struggle. He also repeated his desire to visit the country torn by 14 years of civil war, despite threats against him from Moslem extremists. On Oct. 9, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> begins a visit to <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>, the world's largest Moslem country with an estimated 140 million Moslems and a tiny <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> minority of 5 million He will be there until Oct. 14. The pope has previously stopped in such predominantly Islamic countries as <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> as well as several African countries with large Moslem populations. The era of dialogue was spurred by the <ORGANIZATION> Second </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vatican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, which also opened the way to improved relations between Catholics and Jews. `` Upon the Moslems, too, the church looks with esteem,'' said the 1965 declaration Nostra Aetate. `` They adore one God, living and enduring, merciful, and all powerful, maker of heaven and earth and speaker to men.'' <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> officials are pleased that its efforts have led to stepped-up exchanges of visits between church representatives and Moslem theologians. The <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> also maintains diplomatic relations with a number of predominantly Islamic countries, including <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>'s calls for a homeland for the <LOCATION> Palestinians </LOCATION> have won him appreciation in the Moslem world while his meetings with <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> leader <PERSON> Yasser </PERSON> <PERSON> Arafat </PERSON> drew protests from <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, a country with which the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> has refused to establish formal diplomatic relations. The church has generally been cautious to avoid offending Moslem sensibilities. Officials note that on Islamic issues, it often has to deal with governments, not religious leaders. `` It's something like the church in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, where diplomacy is the best method. We like to do things quietly,'' said a <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> official speaking on the usual rule of anonymity. During the height of the fury earlier this year over <PERSON> Salman </PERSON> <PERSON> Rushdie </PERSON>'s novel `` The Satanic Verses,'' the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>'s newspaper said millions of Moslems had found the novel offensive. It condemned `` whatever is irreverent and blasphemous'' in the book but said the author should not be killed, as the late Iranian leader, <PERSON> Ayatollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruhollah </PERSON> <PERSON> Khomeini </PERSON>, demanded. According to church surveys, the amount of religious liberty and pluralism varies considerably in the Moslem world. In some cases, the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> minorities `` live in a state of tension and of concern at the possibility of new restrictions,'' said Fides, a press service at the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION>'s missionary office. The <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> is worried about the spread of Moslem fundamentalism in countries such as <LOCATION> Sudan </LOCATION> ad in <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION>, where rivalries between Christians and Moslems led to the burning of churches and mosques in the northern part of the country in 1987. In an unusual public criticism, the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> in a major document on racism issued in February condemned the imposition of the <LOCATION> Sharia </LOCATION>, or Islamic law, on non-Moslems. Catholicism's fastest growing church is in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, but it is subject to special pressures. During a visit to <LOCATION> Rwanda </LOCATION> in 1982, <LOCATION> Libyan </LOCATION> leader Col. <PERSON> Moammar </PERSON> <PERSON> Gadhafi </PERSON> declared `` Africa is not Christian'' and called for a holy war to help spread Islam on the continent. <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> officials consider <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION> a generally tolerant country, but <LOCATION> Indonesian </LOCATION> <PERSON> Catholics </PERSON> say they are worried about a government bill presented to <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> that would give legal recognition to several hundred Islamic courts. Religion and politics are also intertwined on <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Timor </LOCATION>, a former <LOCATION> Portuguese </LOCATION> colony with a large Catholic population forcibly annexed by <LOCATION> Indonesia </LOCATION> in 1976. Church officials report that a number of Moslems have been converting to Catholicism as a political statement of their opposition to <LOCATION> Indonesian </LOCATION> rule.

 <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Baryshnikov </PERSON> gave an exciting performance in `` American Document'' at the opening night gala of the <ORGANIZATION> Martha </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Graham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Baryshnikov </PERSON> danced as though born to the <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> technique, although his training is in ballet, which is much different. <PERSON> Cecilia </PERSON> <PERSON> Peck </PERSON>, a student at the <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> school and daughter of actor <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Peck </PERSON>, narrated the dance, a celebration of democracy which Miss <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> choreographed originally in 1938 and revised this year. The 95-year-old choreographer took bows with the company after the performance Tuesday night at the City Center, and the audience responded with a standing ovation. <PERSON> Baryshnikov </PERSON> and <PERSON> Maxine </PERSON> <PERSON> Sherman </PERSON> danced the roles of an `` everyman'' couple who move through the history of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Both were modest but eager, stalwart and optimistic. Their duets _ from embattled through proud to beautifully romantic _ were a high point of `` American Document.'' In the original production, the parts were danced by <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> and <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON>. <PERSON> Joyce </PERSON> <PERSON> Herring </PERSON>, in red, danced the counterpart to the narrator. In revising the dance, Miss <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> changed the chorus from the original all women to nine women and eight men. She also integrated the speaking and dancing more smoothly and she changed the music `` American Document'' is danced to from a score by <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON> to `` Concerto for Oboe and Orchestra'' by <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Corigliano </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bert </PERSON> <PERSON> Lucarelli </PERSON> was oboe soloist and <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Sussman </PERSON> conducted. The evening began with `` Night Chant'' from 1988 and ended with `` The Rite of Spring'' from 1984, both choreographed by <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Graham </PERSON>. The company will dance at the <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> through Oct. 22.

<HEAD>`Last Temptation' Controversial for Cable Too</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 The uproar that surrounded `` The Last Temptation of Christ'' at the box office was renewed when it hit cable television this week, with some groups vowing to cancel subscriptions and others protesting local blackouts of the film. Several cable companies around the country refused to show the movie, transmitted on the <ORGANIZATION> Cinemax </ORGANIZATION> pay cable network, prompting outcries of censorship, while others broadcast disclaimers beforehand. The movie portrays the life of <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Christ </PERSON> and includes scenes of a fantasy <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> entertains in the movie about being married to <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Magdalen </PERSON>. Its box-office opening last year was followed by protests nationwide, with some theaters canceling showings because of bomb threats. In <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ark. </LOCATION>, about 300 members of eight churches vowed to cancel their cable television subscriptions for six months after the movie was shown Monday night on <PERSON> Cinemax </PERSON>. `` We know there are many other forms of what we would call sinful viewing, but we feel the line must be drawn somewhere,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hair </PERSON>, pastor of <ORGANIZATION> Calvary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>. `` We know that people are free to watch what they want, and by the same token we're free to make an appeal. We believe the message of <PERSON> Christ </PERSON> is being blasphemed.'' Cable companies across the country, including at least three in <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> and two in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, were blacking out the movie to their subscribers, but the manager of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cablevision </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION> said he refused to. `` One, we believe we're not allowed to censor the programming under our contract with <ORGANIZATION> Cinemax </ORGANIZATION>; and, two, a basic First Amendment reason _ we might not agree with what the movie has to say, but we're not going to censor it because one element of the community asks us to.'' Officials Home Box Office, the parent company of <ORGANIZATION> Cinemax </ORGANIZATION>, said they would have no comment on the controversy. Some of the protests were against the cable companies' decision not to show the movie. In <LOCATION> Jonesboro </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ark. </LOCATION>, more than 30 people carried signs that `` Stand Up Against Censorship'' as they marched outside <ORGANIZATION> East </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arkansas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cablevision </ORGANIZATION>. man confused over his identity and purpose, and subject to sexual temptation. In <LOCATION> Wilkes-Barre </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> displayed a message on a blue screen: `` The management of <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> have decided not carry this film because of strong content objections voiced by various groups when the movie was initially released to theaters. We do not believe it is responsible to offer a movie, even on a paid channel, which was not generally shown in general theaters because of sensitive content.'' `` I went to <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> to fight against this kind of thing,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Tattersall </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Wilkes-Barre </LOCATION>. `` I came home and was taking my boots off to go to bed when I switched on the TV. I do n't even want to watch the thing; I'm just angry they're censoring it.'' A 73-year-old <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> man has sued <ORGANIZATION> Multimedia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cablevision </ORGANIZATION> for $ 1 million for allegedly violating his constitutional rights by pre-empting the movie. `` I'm a World War II veteran, and I treasure our Constitution and all the provisions of it, and I say if we do n't protect it then we deserve to lose it,'' <PERSON> Felix </PERSON> <PERSON> Olim </PERSON> said.

 Israeli soldiers killed two guerrillas in a firefight in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s self-proclaimed security zone in southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, and one soldier was slightly hurt, an army spokesman said. He said Tuesday's clash occurred nearly two miles north of the border, in a deep, vegetation-covered ravine near the Lebanese Shiite Moslem village of <PERSON> Bayt </PERSON> <PERSON> Lif </PERSON>. The spokesman, speaking anonymously under army regulations, said a patrol encountered a guerrilla group at close range and attacked it. It was not immediately clear whether more than two guerrillas were involved or to which organization they belonged. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> carved out the six-to-10 mile security zone when it withdrew the bulk of its troops from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> in 1985 following a three-year occupation.

 What's hot for 1990? Try `` wet'' beer on the rocks, New Age radio, shorter hair on women and longer hair and wider ties on men, says the author of `` The American Forecaster 1990.'' Also hot, says futurist <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Long </PERSON>, will be the `` smart toilet,'' a Japanese invention that checks a seated person's blood pressure, pulse, urine, temperature and body weight and displays its findings on a built-in monitor. New Age radio took off so quickly that it is a major trend, said Long. `` It's been called musical wallpaper, at its most disparaging. It's somewhere between jazz and soft rock, and it has the potential to not offend a fairly wide proportion of the population,'' he said. `` Wet'' beer, a heavier brew served on the rocks, will debut in 1990 along with lower-proof liquor, but low-alcohol beer will continue to founder, <PERSON> Long </PERSON> said. White will be the fashionable color in clothing for women, who will favor shorter hair, he said. Men will grow their hair longer and wear wider ties, the Forecaster predicts. Long, 40, a <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> free-lance writer who began the Forecaster in 1983, claims an 80 percent accuracy rate. He also predicted a <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> presidency and the demise of television's `` <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>'' and `` Dynasty.'' Long's book sells fewer than 10,000 copies despite all the interest it stirs up in the future. `` A popular phrase some futurists are using is that life has the potential to move forward very rapidly because 80 percent of all the scientists and engineers who have ever lived are alive today,'' said Long. `` The corollary to that is that 80 percent of all the artists, crackpots and loonies who have ever lived are alive today,'' he said.

<TEXT>
 Fearing they might miss the last train to the West, hundreds of East Germans scuffled with Czechoslovak police to get to the West German Embassy. Many refugees were injured. The desperate struggle came hours before <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> sought to curb the exodus of refugees on Tuesday, banning its citizens from traveling to <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> without a visa. However, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> also decided Tuesday to permit the about 10,000 East Germans around the embassy compound to emigrate to the West. Hundreds of East Germans overturned a police barricade and scaled facades, rooftops or a 6-foot spiked fence in an effort to reach the crowded embassy compound, which had been closed earlier Tuesday. Police swung their nightsticks and `` clubbed like mad,'' one Czechoslovak witness reported. Many refugees were left blood-spattered. More people from the waiting crowd surged toward where the beatings took place. Refugees quickly built `` a human ladder'' to help many clear the fence, witnesses said. Some became caught on the fence's sharp spikes, while others jumped or fell head-first to the ground. Some were later seen lying unconscious inside the compound, the witnesses said. Outside the embassy, families with small children were unable to get inside. `` This is pandemonium,'' said a <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> assistant handling injured refugees on the embassy grounds. Thousands of other East Germans had packed into the embassy grounds earlier, and <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> officials feared sanitation problems. Later Tuesday, young men were seen climbing the embassy facade from a truck. Refugees inside the compound pulled them in through windows. The crowd of East Germans flocking to the embassy continued to swell during the day. More newcomers joined them after dark, shivering in freezing weather as their promised departure by East German trains was delayed.

 Housing Secretary <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> is winning support in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> for much of his broad plan to curb political influence in distributing housing subsidies. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> on Tuesday unveiled a 58-point plan to clean up the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>, which would eliminate spending at the secretary's discretion and impose new management and ethics regulations. `` Many past funding decisions were, frankly, based on political influence rather than merit,'' <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> said. `` Under my stewardship, no decisions will be made at <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> for the political advantage or personal gain of any one person or of a political party.'' <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, in announcing his program, said he did not believe the appointment of a special prosecutor was necessary to investigate allegations of past influence-peddling at the agency. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>'s predecessor, <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, and three of <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>'s former top assistants have refused to testify before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, citing their constitutional rights against self-incrimination Rep. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON>, D-Calif., the chairman of a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee that is investigating fraud and mismanagement at <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> during the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, said he supported most of <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>'s plan `` I believe Secretary <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> is on the right track,'' <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON> said after meeting with <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>. But <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON> said he was not ready to go along with <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>'s suggestion that there is no need for the Section 8 Moderate Rehabilitation Program The program has been at the center of the <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> scandals, and <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON> says it was plundered by political insiders during the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. `` It's extremely important we do not allow the scandal during the previous administration ... to drive us into giving up the goal, which is to provide affordable, safe, healthy, reasonable housing for tens of millions of American families,'' <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Lantos </PERSON>' reluctance reflected the program's past support among congressional Democrats. Although Republicans have been accused of abusing the program under <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON>, the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration had recommended the program be killed and it was congressional Democrats who annually kept it alive. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>'s proposed changes range from regulatory and administrative steps he can take immediately to more complex changes that will require congressional approval. Many of the proposals mirror those in a largely ignored 1984 <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> report to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, while others were molded after more recent proposals in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and by <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> aides to limit the role of lobbyists and consultants in government funding decisions. <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> proposed killing another program, <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>'s Title X land development insurance, citing use of the money to build upscale projects such as a condominium-golf complex in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. He said he was committed, however, to maintaining <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>'s co-insurance program, which has been the source of nearly $ 1 billion in sour loans to date The program allows private lenders to approve HUD-insured mortgages and was a major part of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's efforts to contract federal work to private contractors. `` The problem was not the idea,'' <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> said. `` The problem was in the implementation of the idea.'' <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> barred from <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> work one company, <ORGANIZATION> DRG </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Funding </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which has had defaults on $ 709 million of the $ 1.1 billion in HUD-insured loans it approved. Other highlights include: _ Appointment of a <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> chief financial officer and a separate comptroller for its <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, whose loan programs have been troubled by fraud and mismanagement believed to have cost more than $ 4 billion _ Requiring all lobbyists and consultants who work on <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> proposals to register with the department and disclose their fees, which <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> could deduct from any funding awards <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> asked <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to impose civil fines of up to $ 10,000 for violations of the registration requirement. He also proposed similar fines for <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> employees who disclose funding decisions prior to public announcements. _ Publishing all <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> funding decisions and waivers in the Federal Register Many projects cited in the April audit received waivers allowing them to receive rent subsidies above <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> limits. _ Allocating up to $ 100 million for monitoring <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION> housing and community development programs <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON> said the department spends less than $ 25 million to track annual grants totaling nearly 10 times that amount. _ Increasing the staff of the department's inspector general and granting the office the power to subpoena witnesses for its investigations

 A leading Hispanic group and the alcohol and tobacco industries are dismissing claims that beer, cigarette and fast-food ads are jeopardizing Latinos' health. The Center for Science in the <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interest </ORGANIZATION> said in a publication called `` Marketing Disease to Hispanics'' that Latinos suffer from an increasing number of health problems related to drinking, smoking and high-fat fast foods. The Beer Institute, a trade association, said Tuesday's report had no scientific basis and rejected suggestions that the beer industry is promoting alcoholism among Hispanics. Institute president <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON> said money contributed by the industry to the Hispanic community benefits public health, literacy and cultural programs as well as economic development. `` Problems of nutrition and substance abuse in the Hispanic community are real, and they deserve real action and real solutions,'' <PERSON> Sanders </PERSON> said. `` Taking down billboards and shuttering hamburger stands wo n't help these very real problems.'' <ORGANIZATION> Anheuser-Busch </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Aguirre </PERSON> said his company's advertising promotes responsible beer drinking and discourages alcohol abuse He called the report `` irresponsible, patronizing.'' It `` assumes that Hispanic American citizens can not make sound, educated consumer decisions just like other segments of the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> public,'' <PERSON> Aguirre </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> <PERSON> Merryman </PERSON>, vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, a trade association for the cigarette industry, agreed: `` Anybody who sees an advertisement for a product is capable of making a decision about whether to use it.'' Dr. <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Molina </PERSON>, a member of the center's board and president of the Latino Caucus of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said Hispanic groups have been silent on the issue largely because they receive about $ 1 million a year from alcohol, tobacco and `` junk-food'' companies. `` That support ... muzzles our national leaders on vital health issues,'' he said. However, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Raza </ORGANIZATION>, a leading non-profit Hispanic service organization with affiliates in 26 states, rejected that conclusion. <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Herrera </PERSON>, vice president of the council, estimated the group gets 2 percent of its funding from beer or tobacco companies. `` We do n't feel compromised,'' she said. `` If we ca n't take people's money and do what we need to do then we should n't have any business taking that money.'' The council has `` been in the business of drug and alcohol abuse programs, and we're still operating them,'' she said. The report cites studies showing: _ Men of <LOCATION> Mexican </LOCATION> heritage have a 40 percent higher risk of death due to cirrhosis of the liver than white men _ In <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION>, lung cancer rates among Hispanic men increased 132 percent between 1970 and 1980, compared with a 12 percent increase among white men In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, lung cancer deaths nearly tripled for Hispanic men from 1958 to 1982, while doubling for white men. _ Obesity, linked to adult-onset diabetes, among Hispanic women over age 18 was about 25 percent more prevalent than among white women The report calls for higher excise taxes on alcoholic beverages and cigarettes, a ban on cigarette vending machines and a ban on all alcoholic beverages and cigarette advertising that links those products with health and youthfulness. The Center for Science in the <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interest </ORGANIZATION> is a non-profit organization that focuses on health and nutrition.

<HEAD>Newspapers Urged to Develop ``Customer Obsession''</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE GLOVER</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The newspaper industry, faced with a decline in readership, must develop `` customer obsession'' to reverse the slide, the president of the <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> Managing Editors told the APME convention. `` Readership surveys can be useful, but they are n't enough,'' said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Janensch </PERSON>, editor and general manager of The <ORGANIZATION> Rockland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal-News </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s suburban <LOCATION> Rockland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION> `` Surveys ca n't halt sliding readership unless the editor and the editor's staff are fanatical about getting close to the community.'' Opening the annual APME convention on Tuesday, <PERSON> Janensch </PERSON> said steadily declining readership `` confronts us with the most serious problem facing newspapers today'' and that it even hits markets where the economy is booming. `` If you are lucky enough to be in a growing market and your circulation is going up, you may think you do n't have a problem,'' he said. `` Wrong. Even where circulation is going up, net newspaper penetration is going down. There are no exceptions.'' `` In 1967, about 73 percent of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> adults said they read a newspaper every day,'' he said. `` Last year, the number was down to 51 percent.'' `` Call it what you will _ customer obsession, putting the reader first, serving the constituents _ we must do it better,'' <PERSON> Janensch </PERSON> said. `` I firmly believe that if we build a strong rapport with our communities, we will prosper. If we do n't, we will fade away.'' While many are captivated by national news and big-name events, most of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s newspapers survive by providing residents of the community with information they need in their daily lives, he said. `` Is your newspaper first and foremost a local newspaper?'' asked <PERSON> Janensch </PERSON>. `` Do you care as much about the expansion of a local business as you do about the national trade deficit?'' In addition to building community ties, <PERSON> Janensch </PERSON> said, a newspaper's staff must reflect the paper's market. `` Does your staff at all levels reflect the racial and ethnic diversity of your target readership?'' he asked the editors. `` Are about half of your staffers women? Do your staffers have roots in the community?'' Also as the convention opened, a military historian dismissed suggestions that negative reporting of the Vietnam War damaged the war effort. Accounts of the Vietnam War often served as a warning flag for top commanders, who often were n't aware of problems in the field, said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Hammond </PERSON>, a historian at the <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> History </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` Sometimes the commander high up the chain of command is the last one to find out anything,'' <PERSON> Hammond </PERSON> said. `` In this case, media coverage actually extended the vision of the commander, and he was able to make a response that was very important to the overall goal of the American military in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>,'' he added. Major stories that would have bruised the Army's image went largely unreported, including the persistent problems of the M-16, the primary infantry weapon used in the war, he said. Far from aiding the war effort, he said, the lack of reporting left officials with little incentive to improve. `` The press in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> did not pick up the story with any consistency,'' <PERSON> Hammond </PERSON> said. `` What happened? The military never had any kind of a prod to do much about repairing the weapon.'' His book `` The Military and the Media'' stirred controversy when he said that, overall, news accounts of the <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> War gave a better picture of that conflict than official reports.

<TEXT>
 Through a combination of cunning, ruthlessness and old-fashioned good fortune, <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has survived yet another challenge to his rule. But whatever sense of triumph <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> felt Tuesday after the defeat of a military uprising against him, most experts believe he is weaker now than at any time since assuming the command of the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> more than six years ago. The Panamanian economy is a wreck, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s base of support has never been narrower, his diplomatic isolation is almost complete and he rules over one of the most alienated populations anywhere in the hemisphere. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has won points among some Panamanians by surviving the unrelenting hostility of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. And among this group, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s ability thus far to win the test of wills with <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> may have left him standing taller than ever. But how far can <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> continue to coast on his anti-Americanism? At some point, it appears the combination of pressures against him eventually will oust him. Those pressures are formidable indeed. In early 1988, after <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> deposed yet a second president in two years who showed an independent streak, the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration moved decisively against him. It froze all Panamanian assets in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, withheld payments to the government relating to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> operations and imposed trade sanctions against the country. All this has contributed to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s impoverishment. After a period in which the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> looked to <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> for help in its effort to bring down <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s leftist government, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> has since done virtually everything in its power to remove him short of invasion. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> insisted Tuesday that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was not behind the anti-Noriega insurrection. Besides pinching him hard economically, the administration has campaigned tirelessly against him internationally and tried to intimidate him by expanding the size of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military establishment based in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. At a different level, <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s image was sullied by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> drug trafficking indictments against <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and was damaged even more by the elections in May when government authorities tossed out the returns rather than acknowledge the defeat of the pro-Noriega candidate. For good measure, government agents assaulted opposition candidates 10 days after the balloting. Even the Organization of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, not known for taking decisive stands, blamed <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> for the `` abuses'' surrounding the elections and called for a democratic transfer of power. The <ORGANIZATION> OAS </ORGANIZATION> effort has since been suspended but <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s international acceptance appears to be at an all-time low The most recent blow occurred on Sept. 1 when the Noriega-controlled council of state named a <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> crony as president of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. It was the second time in 18 months that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> engineered the appointment of a president with no visible qualifications for the job. There is little support around the hemisphere for overt <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military action against <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. After all, there is no apparent danger to the operation of the canal and beyond that, there is strong support in the hemisphere for the notion that outsiders should not intervene in the internal affairs of any nation. But <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is testing the patience of countries which are the most enthusiastic supporters of that principle. Even <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, whose president, <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON>, was with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> when word of the uprising in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> reached here Tuesday, is keeping its diplomatic distance from <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. Although <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> keeps an ambassador in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, Mexican officials have told <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomats they intend to raise their concerns about <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s continued rule with Panamanian authorities.

<HEAD>Noriega Endures Despite Efforts to Oust Him</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 When it comes to <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> presidents make no secret of their distaste. <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said he wanted <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> `` out of there.'' His administration indicted the Panamanian strongman. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the will of the <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> people `` should not be thwarted by this man and a handful of his Doberman thugs.'' He urged the Panamanian people and defense forces to toss him out. <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> accused <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> of stealing last year's election. But simply walking away was n't <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s way. Just as he resisted other efforts to dislodge him, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> apparently succeeded in unhorsing Tuesday's coup attempt by the very troops he commanded and who kept him in power. All manner of ways had been tried to rid <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, but they all had failed. Last year, in February, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was indicted in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, then <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>, on drug-running charges. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> wanted to bring him to trial, but <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> remained. The president of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>, announced he had fired <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, who put him in office in the first place. But it was <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> who left, fired by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>. Every effort seemed to fail. A coup by Defense Forces officers. Anti-Noriega marches. An economic squeeze by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Bargaining for <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s departure. Nothing worked. Last May, <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> held elections. It was clear that the opposition had won despite massive fraud but still <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> remained. Among the international observers was <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>. He said <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was guilty of thievery and said the election tabulations he looked at were `` patently counterfeit.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said at the time that although <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> had ignored <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> demands for a year, he would leave `` because there has been a massive voice of the people heard.'' The president called on foreign leaders to `` urge Gen. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to honor the clear results of the election,'' and told reporters: `` I would like to think that he will heed the call of the people and that he would listen to the international outcry that is building and that he would step down from office.'' In that case, said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, `` the relations with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would improve dramatically and instantly.'' It did n't happen that way. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> long looked the other way when it came to <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, the man with the pockmarked face called <ORGANIZATION> La </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pina </ORGANIZATION>, `` The Pineapple,'' by his countrymen. The Panamanian people had for years heard rumors of what <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was doing: the rigged elections of 1984, the dealing in drugs, the laundering of money. But not until 1987 did they receive confirmation when Col. <PERSON> Roberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON> <PERSON> Herrera </PERSON>, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s No. 2 man, was fired and spilled the beans. Yes, said <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON> <PERSON> Herrera </PERSON>, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> had fixed the election; yes, said <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON> <PERSON> Herrera </PERSON>, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> had sold visas; and yes, said <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON> <PERSON> Herrera </PERSON>, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> had engineered the murder of <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> <PERSON> Spadafora </PERSON>, whose headless torso was found in August 1985 stuffed in a canvas <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> mail bag. Until the former aide talked, no one in the Panamanian military's tight inner circle had accused <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> of so much as fixing a traffic ticket. But <PERSON> Diaz </PERSON> <PERSON> Herrera </PERSON>'s charges spawned the National Civic Crusade, rebelling at the military's heavy presence. The Crusade called a strike, followed by mass protests, and <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> sent soldiers and riot police to break up a mass rally. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> began paying attention when pro-Noriega forces attacked the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> embassy, splattering it with red paint. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration suspended all military and economic aid. Then, the following February, came the indictments, which accused <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> among other things of helping <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s notorious <ORGANIZATION> Medellin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cartel </ORGANIZATION> by providing safe airstrips for its cocaine shipments. <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON>, scorned by the opposition as a puppet, ordered <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> dismissed, but the strongman arranged for the <ORGANIZATION> Legislative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> to remove the president.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: Noriega is Bush's Political Albatross</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By TOM RAUM</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is a longstanding political albatross for President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, and Tuesday's failed coup attempt in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> only prolongs the president's burden. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> just ca n't seem to get <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> from around his neck, or from power in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, no matter what. `` Nothing's changed, our policy remains the same,'' a disheartened <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> told reporters as he confirmed what had already been widely reported _ that the latest effort to oust <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> had failed. The roller-coaster relationship between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the Panamanian strongman haunted <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as a candidate, and the inability to wrest <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> from power plagues him as president. While denying that Tuesday's failed insurrection was `` some American operation,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had all but invited a coup. In May he called on the Panamanian people and defense forces to drive <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> `` and his Doberman thugs'' from office. Yet, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has resisted 2 -LCB- years of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> efforts to oust him, survived two coup attempts and harsh <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic sanctions, evaded drug-dealing indictments, and even emerged from an election that was _ in <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s words _ `` blatantly stolen.'' At a succession of public appearances on Tuesday, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was grim-faced and testy, despite some early reports suggesting <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> had been overthrown _ reports that produced fleeting ebullience in some White House aides, if not in the president. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> insisted to reporters that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> was not behind the coup attempt. When told that the coup had failed, the president's reaction, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> related, was subdued. `` He said OK and went into another meeting.'' As a presidential candidate, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, then the vice president, was attacked repeatedly by Democrats for his relationship with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, particularly regarding when he first learned of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s alleged involvement in drug trafficking. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has had a history of assistance to the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> and covert support for the Nicaraguan Contras, although the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration became disenchanted with him in the mid-1980s. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the former <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> director, insisted he knew nothing of the drug connection until <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s indictment in February 1988 by two federal grand juries. His denial came despite testimony by a former <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> aide, retired Adm. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Murphy </PERSON>, who told a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was told in <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> briefings as long ago as 1983 that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was suspected of drug money-laundering. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> continued to deny any advance knowledge of drug dealing by <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> _ as he does today. In the spring of 1988, reports surfaced that the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration was engaged in plea-bargaining negotiations, with a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> proposal to drop charges in return for his relinquishing power. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> tried to distance himself from the negotiations with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and, in one of his few early breaks with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, said he would not `` bargain with drug dealers'' at home or abroad. Still, Democratic presidential candidate <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> told campaign audiences almost daily: `` I'm not going to be making deals with a drug-running Panamanian dictator.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had little difficulty defeating <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>; ridding himself of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has proved far more difficult. The Reagan-Bush administrations considered a wide range of tactics to topple <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> _ allegedly including luring him to the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> and kidnapping him _ before settling on economic sanctions that damaged <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s economy but barely inconvenienced <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. Then, as president-elect, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` There must be no misunderstanding about our policy: <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> must go.'' As president, in the aftermath of the violence that followed the May elections, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> accused <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> stealing the vote and declared he would love to see <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> `` out of there right now.'' But, when asked Tuesday night by reporters at a state dinner if he was disappointed now that such a coup had failed, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s response held none of his former bravado `` I want to see democracy in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> succeed,'' he said simply.

<HEAD>House Plans Vote on Catastrophic Care Repeal</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> heads for a showdown today on whether to repeal catastrophic health insurance, with architects of the year-old program conceding their highest expectation is to salvage a only small piece of it. Whatever the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> vote _ and even backers admitted they expected a full repeal to prevail _ a final decision on the program must await negotiations with the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> later in the fall. A <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> vote had been planned Tuesday, but it was delayed amid protracted debate on other bills. There was heavy sentiment in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> for repeal, too, but <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, was seeking consensus for saving at least the framework of the program, which was the largest expansion of Medicare since the <ORGANIZATION> Great </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> program was created two decades ago. The catch has been a bipartisan agreement last year that the cost of the expanded benefits must be born fully by the 33 million elderly and disabled people covered by <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> structured the increased fees so those in higher income brackets would pay a larger share in proportion to their tax liability _ up to a maximum of $ 800 this year. But that financing feature generated a firestorm of protest and overshadowed the big expansion in benefits for hospitalization, doctor bills and other costs. The cry for repeal came mainly from three quarters: _ Retirees who complained their former employers were already giving them additional benefits they were being forced to purchase from Medicare _ Upper-income retirees who objected to having to pay a disproportionate share of the costs to make up for the modest $ 4-a-month assessment on the estimated 56 percent of Medicare beneficiaries who do n't have enough money to owe any income taxes _ Those who complained that the program did not address the main need of elderly Americans: insurance for nursing homes and other long-term care With repeal or a massive rollback a virtual certainty, congressional health policy leaders said they anticipate even greater difficulty in the future in winning support for expanded health programs for the elderly. `` Future programs are going to have to be more carefully considered,'' House Speaker <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> told reporters Tuesday. Formally called the Medicare Catastrophic Coverage Act, the program was designed to protect the elderly and disabled from financial ruin in the event of a prolonged hospital stay or other high medical costs. It would pay for unlimited hospitalization after a once-a-year deductible of $ 560 in 1989. Previously, <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> charged a deductible for each hospital stay during a year and provided full payment of hospital bills only up to 59 days a year. The plan also would cap, starting Jan. 1, the amount that beneficiaries must pay for physician services and, beginning Jan. 1, 1991, would phase in a new prescription drug benefit.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> says a drill instructor is responsible for the slogan `` kill, rape, pillage, burn'' used by a group of recruits during basic training at <LOCATION> Parris </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION> `` This is not a normal occurrence and I would consider this an isolated incident,'' Capt. <PERSON> J.R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Mill </PERSON>, public affairs officer at <LOCATION> Parris </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, said Tuesday. The investigation began after Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> McCain </PERSON>, R-Ariz., received a photograph of a recently graduated platoon that showed recruits holding a sign with the slogan and a skull and crossbones Another sign in the picture showed a naked woman. <PERSON> Mill </PERSON> said the signs `` were done in bad taste, which represents neither the policy nor the philosophy of this command or the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> and we are taking corrective action concerning this situation.'' He said the signs `` were made under the supervision and approval of a drill instructor.'' The photograph identifies the drill instructor in charge as Staff Sgt. <PERSON> Kirkpatrick </PERSON>. The public affairs office said there was a Staff Sgt. <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirkpatrick </PERSON> on the base. There was no answer at <PERSON> Kirkpatrick </PERSON>'s office phone Tuesday `` It's outrageous. The Marines ought to be ashamed,'' said <PERSON> McCain </PERSON>, a highly decorated retired <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> captain who spent 5 -LCB- years as a prisoner of war in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. The 8x10 color, formal photograph showed the men standing at attention on risers with the officers who trained them in the foreground. The parents of one of the recruits sent <PERSON> McCain </PERSON> the photo Monday. As part of training, recruits often make signs or pennants with designs and slogans, but <PERSON> Mill </PERSON> said the `` kill, rape, pillage, burn'' slogan should not have been condoned. Recruits, he said, are schooled in a code of conduct that has strict rules about humane treatment of civilians, the enemy and property. `` I was in the service 22 years and never saw anything like this,'' said <PERSON> McCain </PERSON>, blaming the officers in charge. `` It shows a lack of supervision. We are paying those officers with taxpayers dollars. We want them to be honorable fighting men.'' After receiving the photograph, <PERSON> McCain </PERSON> wrote to <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> Commandant Gen. <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON>. `` It is my feeling that ... the signs that the recruits are holding are inappropriate and do violate the values which Americans expect their Marines to carry with them in defense of the nation,'' <PERSON> McCain </PERSON> wrote. `` While platoon mottoes are important to motivation and morale in the boot camp environment, the high standards of the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> demands a philosophy, a set of values, a dedication and a resolve with which the enclosed photograph is simply incompatible.'' <PERSON> McCain </PERSON> asked <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> to ensure that the commanders of the platoon in the photograph `` understand and embrace proper <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> values.'' <PERSON> McCain </PERSON> also asked <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> to make sure the recruits in the photograph were contacted and `` that they understand why this type of conduct is inconsistent with the <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> values and tradition.''

 Pretty and smart, <PERSON> Lori </PERSON> <PERSON> Esker </PERSON> was president of her high school and the Future Farmers of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> chapter, and was involved in many other activities. But friends say she was devastated when her romance with a handsome young farmer broke up. Now, she's in jail, accused of strangling the woman he planned to marry. The charge shocked acquaintances in central <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>'s quiet farm country. `` I have never seen her with a temper,'' said <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Steebs </PERSON>, a friend with whom Ms. <PERSON> Esker </PERSON> lived briefly earlier this year. `` She never swore. She never got mad at anything.'' Ms. <PERSON> Esker </PERSON>, 20, was charged with first-degree murder Monday in the Sept. 20 strangulation of 21-year-old <PERSON> Lisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Cihaski </PERSON>. Her body was found in her car at the motel where she worked near <LOCATION> Wausau </LOCATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Esker </PERSON> admitted killing Ms. <PERSON> Cihaski </PERSON> after an argument over <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Buss </PERSON>, but claimed it was in self-defense, according to court records. A bail hearing is scheduled Thursday in <LOCATION> Wausau </LOCATION>. Broad-shouldered, over 6 feet tall and dark-haired, <PERSON> Buss </PERSON> worked Tuesday on his family's farm near <LOCATION> Eland </LOCATION>, about 25 miles east of <LOCATION> Wausau </LOCATION>, but said he did not want to discuss the case. `` It is a sadness for three families,'' his mother said. Friends said Ms. <PERSON> Cihaski </PERSON> planned an engagement to <PERSON> Buss </PERSON>, who previously dated Ms. <PERSON> Esker </PERSON>. When he and Ms. <PERSON> Esker </PERSON> broke up in June, she was devastated, Ms. <PERSON> Steebs </PERSON> said. `` But in the last month, she was over it,'' Ms. <PERSON> Steebs </PERSON> said. `` She had gone out with a couple of other guys. We thought, ` Good, she is getting on with her life.''' Ms. <PERSON> Esker </PERSON> lived with Ms. <PERSON> Steebs </PERSON> and her husband for about 45 days last summer. `` I could only say something good about her,'' said Swede <PERSON> Larson </PERSON>, owner of a grocery store in <LOCATION> Eland </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Larson </PERSON> said he knew Ms. <PERSON> Esker </PERSON> from years of driving her school bus and from seeing her in his store this past summer. `` It must have been some temper that all at once took ahold of her,'' he said. A family member who answered the door at Ms. <PERSON> Esker </PERSON>'s home near the town of <PERSON> Hatley </PERSON> said the woman's parents would not comment on the case. People in the farming area east of <LOCATION> Wausau </LOCATION> said Ms. <PERSON> Esker </PERSON>, the reigning <ORGANIZATION> Marathon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> dairy princess, was quick to make friends. She was described as a solid student at <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wisconsin-River </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Falls </ORGANIZATION>, where she was majoring in agricultural journalism. At <ORGANIZATION> Wittenberg-Birnamwood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, Superintendent <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> recalled Ms. <PERSON> Esker </PERSON> as a leader in the 440-student school. She was president of the student body in 1986-87, her senior year. The 1987 yearbook listed many activities: president of the <ORGANIZATION> Future </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farmers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, treasurer of the <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> <PERSON> Junior </PERSON> <PERSON> Dairyman </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Future </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leaders </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Honor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION>, the track team, the debate team and Students Against Drunk Driving. Ms. <PERSON> Cihaski </PERSON> graduated in 1986 and <PERSON> Buss </PERSON> in 1982, the superintendent said, adding he recalled seeing <PERSON> Buss </PERSON> date both girls. Friends say Ms. <PERSON> Cihaski </PERSON>, an assistant manager of sales and catering at <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lodge </ORGANIZATION>, attended church every Sunday and regularly bowled with her grandmother. `` She was just a sweet, caring, pleasant person, and she was that way to everybody,'' said <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Boda </PERSON>, a guidance counselor at the high school. A statement filed with the criminal complaint said Ms. <PERSON> Esker </PERSON> told investigators she traveled the 150 miles from the university to <LOCATION> Wausau </LOCATION> to see <PERSON> Buss </PERSON> and Ms. <PERSON> Cihaski </PERSON> and `` get things straightened out.'' While talking in Ms. <PERSON> Cihaski </PERSON>'s car in the motel parking lot, Ms. <PERSON> Esker </PERSON> `` kind of implied'' she was pregnant by <PERSON> Buss </PERSON>, the statement said. Ms. <PERSON> Esker </PERSON> said Ms. <PERSON> Cihaski </PERSON> then grabbed her throat and she grabbed Ms. <PERSON> Cihaski </PERSON>, court records say. `` I thought she was going to kill me or really hurt me,'' Ms. <PERSON> Esker </PERSON>'s statement said. She said she then grabbed a belt and `` put it around her neck.'' When she realized Ms. <PERSON> Cihaski </PERSON> was n't breathing, she said she thought, `` ` Oh my God, I killed her.''' Authorities have not confirmed if Ms. <PERSON> Esker </PERSON> is indeed pregnant. Ms. <PERSON> Steebs </PERSON> said she believes she is n't. Sheriff Deputy <PERSON> Randall </PERSON> <PERSON> Hoenisch </PERSON>'s report states that Ms. <PERSON> Esker </PERSON> re-enacted the killing during an interview Friday. `` At no time was she hesitant or reluctant to re-enact the incident,'' <PERSON> Hoenisch </PERSON> wrote. `` In my opinion, <PERSON> Lori </PERSON> <PERSON> Esker </PERSON> is a strong and powerful woman.''

 Civil libertarians and members of the arts community seem to be accepting House-passed limitations on federal aid to `` obscene'' art as restrictions they can accept. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> voted 381-41 Tuesday to send the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> a spending bill containing the guidelines after adopting them on a voice vote. <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approval is expected this week, and President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is expected to sign the measure. The restrictions are a retreat from a stricter ban that Sen. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.C. </LOCATION>, and other conservatives fought for over the last three months. The language the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> sent the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, worked out last week by <ORGANIZATION> House-Senate </ORGANIZATION> negotiators, bars the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Endowment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Endowment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Humanities </ORGANIZATION> from issuing grants for exhibitions they consider `` obscene.'' Included are works depicting sadomasochism, homoeroticism, sexual exploitation of children or individuals engaged in sex acts. To deny financing, endowment officials must also find a work lacks `` serious literary, artistic, political or scientific value.'' <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> had sought to prohibit federal aid for obscene or indecent art, and for works offensive to a religion, ethnic group, race, age group or the disabled. `` Given the uproar and general mood these days, probably the outcome is something we could live with,'' <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Platt </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, lobbyist for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Museums </ORGANIZATION>, said Tuesday. `` When one melds together principle and politics here, the ultimate result was gratifying,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzpatrick </PERSON>, president of the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Project for the Arts. <PERSON> Fitzpatrick </PERSON>'s organization is among those that have exhibited one of the shows that sparked the conservative attempts to impose restrictions on federal arts assistance. It included photographs, by the late <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mapplethorpe </PERSON>, of homosexual acts and of children in erotic poses. The other show contained a photograph by <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Serrano </PERSON> of a Christ figure in a jar of urine. First Amendment lawyer <PERSON> Floyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> attorney <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> said they believed the language is the first time government aid to art would be limited based on a work's content `` But it's a compromise, and it's a vast improvement over the initial language,'' <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> said. `` We reached an agreement that if I had my druthers I'd rather not have seen,'' conceded Rep. <PERSON> Sidney </PERSON> <PERSON> Yates </PERSON>, D-Ill., who led the bargaining for the opponents of <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>' proposal `` But concessions had to be made.'' The restrictions would last one year while a newly created commission studies endowment procedures and considers if permanent standards should be imposed for federally supported art. `` The <ORGANIZATION> NEA </ORGANIZATION> and the institutions it supports should have higher standards than the local porno store,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Dana </PERSON> <PERSON> Rohrabacher </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Calif </LOCATION>., who lost a fight in July to eliminate the <ORGANIZATION> NEA </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 170 million budget The legislation also requires the <ORGANIZATION> NEA </ORGANIZATION> to notify <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> 30 days before issuing grants to the Southeastern Center for Contemporary Art in <LOCATION> Winston-Salem </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, which showed the <PERSON> Serrano </PERSON> picture, and the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Contemporary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Art </ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pennsylvania </ORGANIZATION>, which exhibited the Mapplethorpe photographs. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Duncan </PERSON>, counsel to the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION>, called that provision `` a method of intimidation.'' The <ORGANIZATION> NEA </ORGANIZATION> spent $ 45,000 for the two exhibits. Many lawmakers had privately expressed a desire to adopt some restrictions, fearing failure to do so would leave them vulnerable to election opponents accusing them of favoring pornography. After the July fight on <PERSON> Rohrabacher </PERSON>'s proposal, the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> sent press releases to the districts of 21 Democrats, accusing them of supporting `` sexually explicit and anti-religious works of art.'' The NEA is required by law to support materials that `` in the experts' view foster excellence, are reflective of exceptional talent, and have significant literary, scholarly, cultural or artistic merit.'' The $ 11.2 billion measure for the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, cultural and other programs is for fiscal 1990, which began Sunday. The legislation also extends for another year a ban on the leasing of offshore tracts for oil and gas drilling; imposes new restrictions on lobbyists who seek federal money for clients; and allows lumber companies to cut timber on federally owned land in the Northwest while protecting areas inhabited by the rare spotted owl.

<HEAD>Lujan Wants to Ban Plastics in Parks</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lujan </PERSON> wants federal parks free of throw-away plastic and Styrofoam cups, plates and utensils. <PERSON> Lujan </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> officials this week he would like the concessionaires in the parks to ban all non-biodegradable containers, packages and utensils. A spokesman said later that <PERSON> Lujan </PERSON> would not object in some cases to an exception to the rule as long as the plastic items are disposed of through a recycling program. Most plastic utensils and containers made of polystyrene foam _ such as cups and fast-food containers _ are not biodegradable, meaning that when buried in a landfill they do n't disintegrate for perhaps hundreds of years. Environmentalists have complained that the widespread use of such products has added considerably to the problems of waste disposal as cities are running out of room for landfills. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Yosemite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> already has curbed the use of such items, substituting paper items, and in some cases using a recycling program for plastic items. `` This voluntary initiative, modeled after the successful program implemented -LRB- at Yosemite -RRB- will stress the desirability of utilizing reusable recyclable or degradable products,'' <PERSON> Lujan </PERSON> said in a memorandum to all <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> employees. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Ridenour </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, is scheduled to discuss <PERSON> Lujan </PERSON>'s proposal at a meeting later this week with about 300 concessionaires who operate everything from restaurants to snack shops at the parks, according to an Interior spokesman. Of the 350 million visitors to the parks each year, half eat or drink from a container that is not biodegradable, said <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Berklacy </PERSON>. <PERSON> Lujan </PERSON>, who has been criticized by environmentalists for not being a good steward of the public lands, told employees they should be role models in the area of waste recycling. He also ordered the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> cafeteria at the headquarters building in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> stop using, whenever possible, containers or utensils that are not biodegradable unless they can be recycled. Interior spokesman <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldstein </PERSON> said that was a first among federal departments and agencies. `` Although this action may be only a small first step toward improving our environment,'' <PERSON> Lujan </PERSON> said in the memo, `` we should set a public example.'' `` Hopefully by this action we will help foster a new environmental ethic aimed at conserving the vital natural resources which we have a duty to manage for all future generations.''

<TEXT>
 Like any good <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> politician, Soviet Defense Minister <PERSON> Dmitri </PERSON> <PERSON> Yazov </PERSON> knew what to do when he finished his private talks in the Oval Office with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. <PERSON> Yazov </PERSON> strode out the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Wing </LOCATION> doors, past the ever-present <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> guard, and marched right up to the bank of cameras and microphones in the driveway Tuesday to offer a personal message of peace to the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people. `` The Soviet people are cherishing the best sentiments and feelings toward the Americans,'' said the burly, beribboned general. `` We were comrades at arms during the Second World War and we succeeded in winning a great victory. And now we have no grounds, no reason whatsoever, to go into confrontation -LRB- against -RRB- each other.'' The Soviet general is touring the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as the guest of his American counterpart, <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON>. His meeting with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was delayed for a half-hour as the president received an intelligence briefing from national security adviser <PERSON> Brent </PERSON> <PERSON> Scowcroft </PERSON> on the attempted coup in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> learned only after the 30-minute session with <PERSON> Yazov </PERSON> that Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s forces apparently had prevailed. Reporters were allowed to witness the opening moments of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s meeting with <PERSON> Yazov </PERSON>, and the president broke from his customary practice by fielding two questions about the coup <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> emphatically denied it was `` some American operation.'' The president asked <PERSON> Yazov </PERSON> to `` pay my respects to President <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>,'' and said recent talks with Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> were `` very fruitful.'' `` We are satisfied. We've got some problems still,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, but `` things are moving in the direction we wanted.'' Out on the driveway, <PERSON> Yazov </PERSON> gave a ringing endorsement of the U.S.-Soviet rapprochement. `` The main point of my discussions with the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> president was the question of arms control, the question of reducing conventional armed forces and weapons and the question of promoting a relationship between our two militaries and our two nations.'' Asked if his meeting with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had advanced the prospects for an arms pact, <PERSON> Yazov </PERSON> smiled and said, `` Well, I do n't think I could really assure success at the negotiations within half an hour.'' But he added, `` Our negotiating teams are working in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. I think we are moving forward step by step to the ultimate conclusion of agreements on the questions. Anyhow, we are counting on progress.'' White House press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said afterward that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had `` reiterated his support for perestroika,'' and expressed hope for early agreements on conventional forces in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and on chemical weapons as well as nuclear arms. <PERSON> Yazov </PERSON> displayed no pique at being left to cool his heels in the Cabinet Room and then having events in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> intrude on the Oval Office meeting. Asked about <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, he replied diplomatically. `` I am not prepared to talk on the issue because I am not aware of what happened in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. ... We have not talked about it at all.'' <PERSON> Yazov </PERSON> said he and <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> hoped to reach agreements on further steps to promote U.S.-Soviet military exchanges and `` a whole program ... designed to promote better understanding between our two militaries and between our peoples.'' Earlier, <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> took <PERSON> Yazov </PERSON>, a Civil War buff, to see the <LOCATION> Gettysburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, battlefield where Union troops repulsed Gen. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>'s Confederate soldiers in a turning point of the war between the states. <PERSON> Yazov </PERSON>'s itinerary included stops today at <LOCATION> Camp </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pendleton </LOCATION>, a Marine training base in <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Luke </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> on Thursday; and <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bragg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, on Friday.

<HEAD>Travelers Traffic Woes Growing, Some Will Stay Home</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HOLLYWOOD, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Nine of 10 Americans think the country's traffic problems are n't getting any better, leading many people to alter their travel plans, a survey said `` Motorists' freedom of mobility is being restricted by congested roads in all sections of this country and the problem is not just limited to major urban areas,'' said <PERSON> Kay </PERSON> <PERSON> Aldous </PERSON>, vice president for public and government affairs for the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Automobile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. `` Many suburban roads also are being affected,'' The second annual `` hassle index,'' released Tuesday, was based on a nationwide survey of 1,743 adults by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Travel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Data </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The results were discussed at a conference in <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> of the <ORGANIZATION> Travel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>. The study showed that 92 percent of drivers believe traffic is worse or has n't improved since last year, compared with 86 percent who felt that way in 1988. Nine percent said they would n't travel because of congestion, the same as last year. `` This has serious implications for the whole travel industry,'' said <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheske </PERSON>, a AAA spokesman. Forty-eight percent of motorists surveyed said local roads are more congested than a year ago and 44 percent said it was unchanged. Five percent said congestion has eased and the rest were undecided. The biggest concerns about traffic were in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION>, where more than 95 percent of respondents said roads are as bad or worse than last year. The figure for the Southeast was only 86 percent. The survey, which gave no margin of error, found that 83 percent of respondents who took a vacation trip 100 miles or more by car or planned to take one this year felt auto travel was worse or at least as bad, up from 80 percent in 1988. Sixty-seven percent said they left earlier to avoid traffic, up from 59 percent. Twenty-nine percent drove at least 10 miles out of their way, the same as last year. To ease traffic problems, the <ORGANIZATION> AAA </ORGANIZATION> recommended the federal government release $ 10 billion in the Highway Trust Fund to construct and improve roads, particularly interstate bypasses around congested metropolitan areas. The `` hassle index'' is compiled from <ORGANIZATION> AAA </ORGANIZATION>'s travel attitude monitor, a report on auto and air transportation that will be released later this year.

 Leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Right </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> to </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> say they are stepping up efforts to persuade state legislatures to restrict abortions. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Steen </PERSON>, executive director of the group, on Tuesday rejected claims by pro-choice groups that their political strength has increased since the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling last spring allowed greater leeway for state regulation of abortion. <PERSON> O'Steen </PERSON>, at a news conference concluding a two-day strategy conference, said anti-abortion candidates have won seven of 10 special elections for state legislative seats since that ruling in a <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> case. Although some polls suggest majority support for abortions, <PERSON> O'Steen </PERSON> argued that support is only for abortions under narrow circumstances. `` Most Americans think ... abortion is wrong,'' he said. The group has prepared model bills that can be introduced by state lawmakers. However, it declined to release copies of the proposed state legislation. Leaders said the legislation would restrict abortions in a number of ways, including `` as a form of birth control.'' It also would call for parental consent in cases of minors seeking abortions, detail a father's rights in an abortion decision, ban the use of public funds and ban abortion used for gender selection. The broadest prohibition would involve abortions used for birth control, a term that <PERSON> O'Steen </PERSON> contended describes the purpose behind 93 percent of all abortions. <PERSON> Burke </PERSON> <PERSON> Balch </PERSON>, state legislative director of the organization, said the group would focus on a handful of states where abortion could become an issue in legislatures during the remainder of 1989. He said those states were <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> might also be targeted he said. Most state legislatures have already adjourned for the year.

 Investors are prepared to help distribute an abortion pill in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> if it becomes available, the developer of the drug says. They are `` ready to create a new company for distributing the drug in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and elsewhere if authorized,'' said <PERSON> Etienne-Emile </PERSON> <PERSON> Baulieu </PERSON>. But <ORGANIZATION> Roussel-Uclaf </ORGANIZATION>, the French company that holds the patent on the pill, is refusing to license the pill for sale in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> or to sell it here on its own, he said. The pill also would have to gain federal approval before it could be sold in this country. <PERSON> Baulieu </PERSON>, a biochemistry professor at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION>, spoke in an interview Tuesday after addressing an <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> science reporters conference. He did not name the investors interested in the pill, which is called RU 486. <PERSON> Baulieu </PERSON> also said he believes that his winning of a major medical award last week should help prospects for the pill's introduction to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> Legislators, judges and others will `` consider that the opinion of such a prestigious -LRB- award -RRB- jury gives additional credibility to the use of such a compound,'' he said. Americans `` who are confident in the progress of science with conscience ... will find ways to have it distributed here,'' he said. <PERSON> Baulieu </PERSON> won the <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Lasker </PERSON> Clinical Medical Research Award for his work on hormones and for developing RU 486. Anti-abortion activists criticized the <PERSON> Lasker </PERSON> jury's decision. In the interview, <PERSON> Baulieu </PERSON> said he believed the award might help persuade <ORGANIZATION> Roussel-Uclaf </ORGANIZATION> to allow <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> distribution and help promote <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> public support for its use, which he called a key factor in its chance for distribution. In <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Baulieu </PERSON> said, the pill has been given to 25,000 women with a 96 percent success rate. The pill makes the uterus expel the embryo. <PERSON> Baulieu </PERSON> said the pill can save the lives of some 200,000 women a year who die from botched abortions around the world. The pill, which should be taken under medical supervision, also can `` give more privacy to the decision of pregnancy interruption,'' he said.

 Drug slogans are meaningless when children learn substance abuse at home, young people told a pair of <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> panels. `` There's a lot more than ` Just Say No!''' said <PERSON> Serena </PERSON> <PERSON> Peterson </PERSON>, 17, of <LOCATION> Newark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, who described herself as a recovered alcoholic and drug user who learned substance abuse from her parents. `` If I asked for a beer, I got it,'' she said.

Also appearing were educators, doctors and children's rights advocates who discussed ways to make the budget responsive to children's needs. But the young people stole the show. <PERSON> Keisha </PERSON> <PERSON> Stith </PERSON>, 16, of the <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, said she `` was n't even a teen yet'' when she became pregnant. The mother of a 3 -LCB- - year-old son, <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON>, said ignorance was to blame `` This education has to start from the lower grades,'' she said. The youngsters also said drug education needed to begin earlier. `` When signs are put in front of schools warning that this is a drug-free zone, the situation has already gone too far,'' said <PERSON> Freida </PERSON> <PERSON> Dyson </PERSON>, 17, of <LOCATION> Harrisburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, one of nearly three dozen children invited to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to take part in National Children's Day observances Sunday `` We have to have older students reaching the younger students,'' said <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Schneller </PERSON>, an 11th grader from <LOCATION> Lawrenceville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>. She said stress is the reason for drug abuse, sexual experimentation and suicide among teens `` Before they go out and deal with early sex or with drugs, they have to be able to deal with these pressures,'' she said. <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON> <PERSON> Gamble </PERSON>, 14, of <LOCATION> Martinsburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> W. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, described her work trying to help the homeless, including raising money for can openers `` Many of the homeless were being housed in motels,'' she said. `` These people had ample food which had been donated, but they had no means of opening the cans.'' <PERSON> Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Vollestedt </PERSON>, 16, of Bend, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, said she started a support group for children from foster homes after family abuse forced her into such a home. `` All of us need a stable environment,'' she said. `` Foster children need this even more.

<HEAD>Court Decisions, Crackdown Make Criminal Lawyers Rethink</HEAD>

<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The drug crackdown and a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision allowing prosecutors to seize money and property earmarked for attorneys' fees may chase some of the nation's top defense lawyers out of criminal law. Racketeering laws, they complain, give the government so much power to confiscate assets that the Sixth Amendment right to choose one's own attorney may effectively vanish because suspects are left penniless before trial. In June, the high court approved that power, ruling 5-4 that prosecutors may even seize assets set aside to pay an attorney. The power applies to all racketeering suspects, not just accused drug traffickers, said <PERSON> Neal </PERSON> <PERSON> Sonnett </PERSON>, president of the 15,000-member <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Criminal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lawyers </ORGANIZATION>. `` In this hysteria of getting tough on crime, there seems to be a feeling that it's OK for the war on crime to become a war on the Constitution,'' he said. The association has made it a policy to help attorneys who are targeted by aggressive prosecutors, <PERSON> Sonnett </PERSON> said, but many defense lawyers are discouraged. `` I have received communications from attorneys who are articulating severe gloom, several of whom are saying they may leave the practice,'' he said. One who abandoned criminal law was <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> attorney <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Hirschorn </PERSON>, who left private practice after 22 years and joined a firm to try civil law. `` What's going on here is that government, every time I tweak its nose, can go after my fees,'' <PERSON> Hirschorn </PERSON> said. `` Prosecutors have the right to shut off the cash flow _ and I have mortgages to pay.'' But <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Dexter </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehtinen </PERSON> said seizure destroys the profit motive and can break up a drug ring more effectively than jail sentences. He said lawyers have no right to argue they are somehow exempt from the law. `` It was very important that the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruled that defense lawyers are not under a different standard,'' he said. <PERSON> Lehtinen </PERSON> said that in his district no lawyer need fear prosecutors going after fees unless the attorney has taken an active part in laundering drug money. But some attorneys said the threat of seizure is abused in other districts. `` They may start with the drug dealers, but they are going to go all the way down,'' said <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Quinon </PERSON>, who defended <ORGANIZATION> Medellin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cartel </ORGANIZATION> boss <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivas </PERSON> last year. `` The final result is that the adversarial system as we have known it is gone _ the government will choose your lawyer,'' said <PERSON> Quinon </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Criminal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lawyers </ORGANIZATION>. Defense attorneys already face the difficult determination of whether prosecutors will freeze their client's assets. In many cases, the line between legally and illegally obtained assets is impossible to draw, they say. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Shohat </PERSON>, who also worked on the <PERSON> Lehder </PERSON> case, said trying to figure out prosecutors' intentions is almost impossible. `` There is no pattern to it,'' <PERSON> Shohat </PERSON> said. `` I've had cases where you would have thought they would act, but there was no seizure, while in other cases, you wonder why they did.'' That means that a defense lawyer must first spend his time and his client's money just defending his fee, instead of preparing a criminal defense. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Beeler </PERSON>, who participated in the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> case that led to the ruling, said prosecutors use of seizure to scare off lawyers, a use of the Racketeer Influenced, Corrupt Organizations Act that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> never intended. On a personal level, <PERSON> Beeler </PERSON> said, `` I've certainly turned down business _ and I hate to do it _ because the government has made it impossible for them to defend themselves.'' One result of private attorneys balking at taking criminal cases will be an increasing load on already overworked public defenders, said <PERSON> Robyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Blumner </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Sonnett </PERSON> said attorneys have been sounding out <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> about an exemption for attorneys' fees, but he acknowledges the political climate makes it difficult for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to appear as if somehow supporting drug dealers. For now, many lawyers say they will continue their criminal practice, but the days of an elite group of top criminal attorneys may be numbered. ` In the next couple of years, you will see some of the best and the brightest leaving criminal practice,'' <PERSON> Quinon </PERSON> said. `` People are already beginning to handle civil cases. That was unthinkable a short while ago.''

 The army twice blocked journalists from meeting Palestinians, and a leading Palestinian activist called the actions signs that <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> is losing its battle against the 21-month-old uprising. Also Tuesday, debate intensified in Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s coalition government over whether to accept <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s offer to arrange peace talks. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s two main parties headed for a possible showdown at an inner Cabinet meeting Thursday. The army on Tuesday barred <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> activists from holding a news conference in predominantly <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> east </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> and halted a U.N.-sponsored press tour of Palestinian refugee camps in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>. Palestinian activist <PERSON> Faisal </PERSON> <PERSON> Husseini </PERSON> told reporters at a police barricade that by banning the news conference <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> was showing that it is failing in efforts to quell the uprising against <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> occupation of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>. `` We believe that we can win and what you are seeing now it is the signs of the beginning of the end of the occupation,'' he said. <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Teddy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kollek </PERSON> complained about the closure on <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio, saying: `` They did not ask us, did not inform us of the reasons ... I think this arrangement is wrong and I plan to clarify that with the chief of command. The question is whether it could be justified by security reasons, because it's becoming a routine and this is not good.'' Police showed reporters an order issued by Maj. Gen. <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Mordechai </PERSON> of the army's central command declaring the scene of a news conference a `` closed military area.'' The news conference had been called to protest an army crackdown on the <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> town of <LOCATION> Beit </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sahour </LOCATION>, which has mounted a civil disobedience campaign, refusing to pay taxes and boycotting Israeli products. <PERSON> Olivier </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafowitz </PERSON>, a spokesman for the army-run <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> government, said the army would this week begin auctioning goods confiscated in tax raids on <LOCATION> Beit </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sahour </LOCATION>. About $ 500,000 worth of televisions, cars and furniture have reportedly been seized. About 45 foreign reporters and photographers traveling in a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> bus were turned back by the army at a <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> checkpoint while hundreds of private vehicles were allowed to pass, including those of Jewish settlers carrying weapons. A statement issued by the army spokesman's office in <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION> criticized the U.N. Relief and <ORGANIZATION> Works </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> for failing to coordinate the visit in advance and said the army feared the presence of journalists would incite violence. More than 580 Palestinians have died in clashes with soldiers and <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> civilians during the uprising. Forty Israelis have been slain. At least 123 Palestinians have been killed by fellow Arabs as suspected collaborators. Differences in the coalition Cabinet focus on <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s objections to a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> delegation for peace talks that would include deported pro-Palestine <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> activists The talks would be over holding elections in the occupied territories. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s left-leaning <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> favor the proposed <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION> talks. But <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc fears that any meeting with the expatriate Palestinians would be seen as implicit recognition of <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> demands for the right of 5 million Palestinians to return to land that is now part of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Yossi </PERSON> <PERSON> Ben-Aharon </PERSON>, a <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> aide, suggested a compromise may be possible under which <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would convene for exploratory talks on the composition of a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> delegation. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Monday told <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> that he was willing to try to arrange a summit with President <PERSON> Hosni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>.

 The union representing 57,000 <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> employees went on strike early Wednesday in its first strike against the world's largest aerospace company in 12 years. Machinist union members in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wichita </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION>, and elsewhere began the walkout at 12:01 a.m. local time, union officials said. In <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> on Tuesday, the union overwhelmingly rejected what <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> said would be its final contract offer. Union leaders had said they would notify a federal mediator, who joined negotiations last weekend, that they would be willing to consider resuming negotiations. But <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lodge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> 751 </ORGANIZATION>, said the union would not be in favor of extending the midnight strike deadline. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> issued a statement several hours after the strike vote, expressing disappointment but vowing to continue operations with supervisors and non-striking workers. `` Our airline customers have been notified of a strike and our intention to support deliveries to the best of our ability,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> statement said. `` It is impossible to make a general statement on all defense and space programs since they are at various stages of development and production.'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said the main reason for the strike vote was a feeling that <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> workers deserved a greater share of the company's record prosperity <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>, the world's largest commercial airplane builder, is enjoying its fifth consecutive year of record jetliner orders, with carriers and leasing companies ordering 736 planes worth $ 38.5 billion so far this year. `` We have gone through the hard times with this company,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. `` We just want to go through the good times with them as well as the hard times.'' <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> offered an immediate raise of 4 percent, with 3 percent raises in 1990 and 1991. The proposed three-year contract also contained annual bonuses of 8 percent of a worker's gross earnings this year and 3 percent the next, insurance improvements and reduced compulsory overtime requirements to 160 hours a quarter. Workers filling more than half of the 65,000-seat Kingdome jeered the offer and folded summaries of it into paper airplanes that sailed through the stadium. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> voting in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wichita </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, and elsewhere were asked to decide whether to accept the contract, a simple majority vote, and whether to strike, which requires a two-thirds majority of members voting. Union leaders told the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION>, who last struck <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> in 1977 for two months, the time was right to demand more. `` If you are n't tough enough to secure a decent contract this time you'll never get one,'' said <PERSON> Justin </PERSON> <PERSON> Ostro </PERSON>, general union vice president and bargaining coordinator. `` If you turn tail and run, do n't come back in three years'' expecting great change, he added. `` There is no good time to strike. There is only the right time.'' Though Pentagon cutbacks have reduced military business, one division, <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commercial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airplanes </ORGANIZATION>, has a backlog of nearly 1,600 jets worth about $ 70 billion and deliveries extending well into the mid-1990s. For 1988, profits were $ 614 million on $ 16.96 billion in sales. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> also is holding $ 3.66 billion in cash and short-term notes. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said a strike could last `` a week. It could be months.''

<HEAD>Fairness Doctrine Included in Budget Reconciliation Bill</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The House is trying once again to write a fairness doctrine to require broadcasters to air opposing viewpoints on controversial issues. On a 261-162 vote Tuesday, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> refused to strip the fairness provision from a budget reconciliation bill. Rep. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Markey </PERSON>, D-Mass., said opponents of the fairness doctrine had used the threat of a presidential veto as a `` red herring. `` The threat of a veto does not exist,'' said Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Dingell </PERSON>, D-Mich., who as chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> has been the main backer of the move to codify 40-year-old rules the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> abandoned in 1987 The <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> said the doctrine violated the First Amendment and no longer served the public interest in an era of numerous media voices. <PERSON> Congres </PERSON> wrote the doctrine into law last year, but it was vetoed by President <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has indicated he would follow suit if such a bill reached his desk, but he has n't said what he would do if it were contained in a reconciliation bill, which contains <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s hard-won capital gains tax reduction. The Energy and <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> added the fairness doctrine provision to the reconciliation bill earlier this year, giving the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> new authority to impose fines on stations found to be violating the doctrine. Rep. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Oxley </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ohio </LOCATION>, offered an amendment Tuesday to delete the fairness doctrine from the reconciliation bill, saying the committee added the civil fines only to make the provision germane to budget legislation. <PERSON> Oxley </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> never administered fines while the fairness doctrine was in effect from 1949 to 1987 and never sought the authority to do so. `` What this amounts to is simply government intrusion on free speech and government micromanagement of the news,'' <PERSON> Oxley </PERSON> said. But <PERSON> Markey </PERSON> said the fairness doctrine would assure that broadcasters cover important community issues `` in a fair and balanced manner.'' A <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> fairness doctrine bill was approved in April by the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> but has not come to the floor for a vote. If a fairness doctrine passes <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> signs it, a <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> test is likely, based on what opponents say is the doctrine's unconstitutional infringement on broadcasters' rights. A federal appeals court earlier this year ruled that the <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> had the authority to scrap the doctrine, but the court sidestepped the issue of the doctrine's constitutionality. Many broadcasters, particularly small-station owners, oppose the fairness doctrine, saying the threat of lawsuits is enough to make them `` just play music'' instead of discussing controversial issues.

<TEXT>
 The disappearance of six children of dead polygamist leader <PERSON> Ervil </PERSON> <PERSON> LeBaron </PERSON> dims hopes of breaking two decades of religious violence in which more than 20 people were slain, authorities say. The six fled foster homes in <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> on Friday and may be headed to a family hideout in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, authorities said. `` It's sad,'' said <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwendiman </PERSON>, assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney for <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, who heads a `` <ORGANIZATION> LeBaron </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Crime </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Family </ORGANIZATION>'' task force. `` You think maybe you have a chance to stop the violence and give these kids a chance for a normal life ... and then it blows up on you.'' The children were identified as <PERSON> Norma </PERSON> <PERSON> LeBaron </PERSON>, 18; <PERSON> Nikki </PERSON> <PERSON> LeBaron </PERSON>, 17; <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON> <PERSON> LeBaron </PERSON>, 15; <PERSON> Jerod </PERSON> <PERSON> LeBaron </PERSON>, 14; <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> LeBaron </PERSON>, 13, and <PERSON> Joshua </PERSON> <PERSON> LeBaron </PERSON>, 12. Authorities believe <PERSON> LeBaron </PERSON>'s eldest surviving son and clan patriarch, <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON>, may have organized their escapes, <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Attorney </LOCATION>'s Investigator Lt. <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Forbes </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON>, 29, and brothers <PERSON> Aaron </PERSON>, 22, and <PERSON> Heber </PERSON>, 25, are believed to have led the clan in a recent series of killings that followed the practice of blood atonement preached by their father, authorities said. <PERSON> Heber </PERSON> and <PERSON> Aaron </PERSON> are in custody. Relatives believe the three brothers are executing a hit list written by their father, who founded the violent Church of the Lamb of God and was convicted of ordering the 1977 slaying of a rival <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> polygamist. <PERSON> LeBaron </PERSON>, who had a dozen wives and fathered more than 50 children, died of a heart attack in 1981 at age 56 in the <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> State Prison. Authorities and relatives describe his `` Book of New Covenants,'' written in prison, as a blueprint for revenge against those <PERSON> LeBaron </PERSON> believed abandoned him after his arrest. The clan is a radical offshoot of the <ORGANIZATION> Mormon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, which now bans polygamy. The six children were placed in foster homes after being subpoenaed along with other family members by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Attorney </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> for a grand jury investigation into the Oct. 16, 1987, killing of <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> polygamist and former LeBaron lieutenant Authorities said the children refused to cooperate with the investigation out of fear of retribution from other family members. The clan has been dealt a series of blows in the past two years with the arrests of more than a dozen members. <PERSON> Heber </PERSON> <PERSON> LeBaron </PERSON> and four others are in prison in <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, convicted of operating a truck theft ring to finance the family. <PERSON> Heber </PERSON> also is wanted in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> for attempting to kill a guard in a credit union holdup. <PERSON> Aaron </PERSON> <PERSON> LeBaron </PERSON> and two other members are being held in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> on federal charges of possessing false identification papers. <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> may have sought to gather remaining family members and regroup in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Forbes </PERSON>, who has tracked the clan for more than a decade. The three brothers remain suspects in the killings of three former LeBaron followers and the daughter of one of the victims in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> suburb of Irving on June 27, 1988. They also are suspects in the disappearance of former LeBaron apostle <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Evoniuk </PERSON> near <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cruz </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, in May 1987. Other members are in hiding, believing they are on the hit list, <PERSON> Forbes </PERSON> said. They include <PERSON> Rena </PERSON> <PERSON> Chynoweth </PERSON>, a former wife of <PERSON> Evril </PERSON> <PERSON> LeBaron </PERSON>, and her mother, <PERSON> Thelma </PERSON>, who were trying to adopt the six youngsters when they disappeared. <PERSON> Rena </PERSON>'s brothers, <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> and <PERSON> Duane </PERSON> <PERSON> Chynoweth </PERSON>, were killed in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, along with <PERSON> Duane </PERSON>'s 8-year-old daughter, <PERSON> Jennifer </PERSON>. `` They killed my brothers and my sister and my niece,'' said <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Chynoweth </PERSON>, <PERSON> Rena </PERSON>'s brother, who lives in Sunset. `` I wanted to break that chain so we do n't have some up and coming young ones to be trained in violence.''

 Tens of thousands of people are arriving in the nation's capital to urge <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration to lift the homeless from the streets and make housing more affordable for all Americans. Organizers would n't say Tuesday what turnout they expect for three days of activities culminating in a `` Housing Now!'' march Saturday on the national Mall. But the breadth of their sponsorship, coupled with a massive planning effort dating to early in the year, could produce one of the largest demonstrations <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> has seen in years. `` We're saying enough is enough,'' said <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> homeless activist <PERSON> Mitch </PERSON> <PERSON> Snyder </PERSON>. `` Today the streets in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> look like those in <LOCATION> Calcutta </LOCATION>. This demonstration is to provide some will and some backbone to the administration and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>.'' Activists complain the Reagan-Bush administrations cut the budget authority for federal housing assistance programs by 77 percent _ from $ 32 billion to less than $ 8 billion a year _ and cite that as the principal reason for the growing numbers of people who are without homes.

<HEAD>Panama's Wily, Ruthless Defense Forces Chief Savors a Crisis</HEAD>
<HEAD>With PM-Panama, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>PANAMA CITY, Panama (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, who once called his opponent's bullets `` kisses,'' is a shrewd and ruthless survivor who revels in power and in thumbing his nose at what he calls `` the colossus of the North.'' On Tuesday, elements of the 15,000-man <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> he commands claimed they had deposed him. But once again, he dodged the bullet and showed up Tuesday afternoon to accept the rebels' surrender It is known that `` Tony'' <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> enjoys a crisis, and events of the last 18 months would have driven a less determined man into retirement. Many Panamanians want him out. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which indicted him on drug-trafficking charges in February 1988, has tried everything short of military force to remove him. The international community has condemned him. But <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, who comes from <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chorrillo </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> district where <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> headquarters is located, has survived and created a mystique. It is said he thrives on pressure and would prefer death to losing power. That is part of machismo that won him the nickname `` The Man,'' the English word his initials spell. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has wrapped himself in nationalism, saying it is part of the historic mission of his generation to take control of the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION>. Under an accord with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> is to take over the canal by the year 2000. During his last crisis in May after the opposition swamped his candidate in presidential elections that were annulled by the government, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was seen standing alone before the tomb of his patron, Gen. <PERSON> Omar </PERSON> <PERSON> Torrijos </PERSON>. The epitaph on the tomb is: `` I do n't want to enter heaven. I just want to enter the Canal Zone.'' <PERSON> Torrijos </PERSON>, who seized power in a 1968, signed the 1977 accord with former President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> to turn over the canal. <PERSON> Torrijos </PERSON> was killed in a plane crash in 1981, and <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> became commander of the Defense Forces in 1983. The position has allowed him to control the government. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> says his enemies are fomenting a plot to abrogate the canal pact. The general was raised by foster parents and joined the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> in 1962. His ascent began when he caught the attention of <PERSON> Torrijos </PERSON>, then an ambitious young officer. In his climb to the top, he dealt with everyone from the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> to Colombian cocaine cartels. Less than a year after <PERSON> Torrijos </PERSON> gained power in 1968 coup, he made <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, then an obscure major, chief of intelligence with the rank of lieutenant colonel. It was like having the keys to the city. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> immediately began assembling dossiers on everyone who counted in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s job also put him in close contact with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence agencies, and he formed powerful alliances. One <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official who dealt with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> at the time, on drug enforcement efforts, said <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was polite but when it came to something he wanted, he was `` the coldest man I ever met.'' After <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> became the Defense Forces commander, he acquired a fleet of expensive cars and a home in an exclusive neighborhood. He reportedly is involved in a vast array of businesses including hotels, casinos, a television station, radio stations, maritime services, duty-free liquor stores and prostitution. Rumors about his personal life are plentiful, but there are few facts. Even his age is in dispute. The general says he is 51, but the date in his high school yearbook would make him 54. He is married and has a daughter who lives in the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>. Although his private life is that of a rich man, he worked hard to develop a populist image modeled on the revered <PERSON> Torrijos </PERSON>, spending weekends meeting with residents of towns and villages in this nation of 2.2 million. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> often speaks of his humble origins and characterizes his domestic opponents as rich and white. `` The humble, the poor and the blacks, they are the utmost authority of the people,'' he once said. As the standoff with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> dragged on in past months, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> enjoyed underlining <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s helplessness, despite the 12,000 troops it has stationed in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> exercises his power with ruthless assurance. He has closed newspapers for months at a time, and presidents served at his pleasure. Rumors of opposition inside the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> _ such as the March 16, 1988 coup attempt _ were met with purges and reorganizations. `` Kisses,'' was how he described the bullets fired in that attempted coup. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, long his ally, began to distance itself after the headless body of one of his opponents, <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON> <PERSON> Spadadora </PERSON>, was found in a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> mailbag in <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> in 1985. A full break came in February 1988, when two federal grand juries in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> indicted <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> on drug-trafficking and money-laundering charges. The domestic opposition began to intensify its campaign against <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> imposed crippling economic sanctions. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> did n't budge. Shortly after the indictments in <LOCATION> Floria </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> delivered a speech. He brandished a machete above his head, then brought it crashing down on the podium. `` Not one step back!'' he shouted.

The captain's workload contributed to the accident, <PERSON> Whitten </PERSON> said, but `` you ca n't regulate that. He's expected to handle distractions.'' <PERSON> Georgoudis </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> investigators he had been in control of the ship for 36 hours, catching at most two hours of sleep the morning before the accident. <PERSON> Georgoudis </PERSON> said he stayed on the bridge that long because of poor visibility, which did not clear until that morning. <PERSON> Georgudis </PERSON> said he sent his chief officer below to do calculations for unloading the cargo at <LOCATION> Providence </LOCATION> after the shipping agent messaged the Greek tanker that there might be a second, previously unscheduled stop. <PERSON> Georgoudis </PERSON> said that when the chief officer took longer than expected, he called for a second officer to help him, but the message apparently never was relayed. He also said he had sent his lookout to help a harbor pilot board and was alone with a helmsman when the ship hit <LOCATION> Brenton </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Reef </LOCATION>. `` I was everything'' at that point, trying to handle radio traffic, navigation and various calculations, <PERSON> Georgoudis </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Georgoudis </PERSON> said he saw a buoy warning of the reef about 30 minutes before the accident, but he could not explain the grounding. `` That's my big question,'' <PERSON> Georgoudis </PERSON> said. He said he noticed he was on the wrong side of the buoy only `` when the buoy was very near my bow.'' The captain said he discovered only moments before the accident that he was northeast of where he was to have met the harbor pilot. He said he heard no radio warnings from the pilot boat until the World Prodigy hit the rocks at about 10 knots. The captain acknowledged that <ORGANIZATION> Ballard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shipping </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the tanker's owner, and Greek regulations required a lookout when entering a harbor <PERSON> Georgoudis </PERSON> said he had been in <LOCATION> Providence </LOCATION> harbor once before, in 1987, on a different ship. Defense lawyer <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> DiBiase </PERSON> refused to let <PERSON> Georgoudis </PERSON>, 43, answer questions after the hearing and said the captain would return immediately to <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Georgoudis </PERSON> agreed to testify after pleading guilty Friday to one misdemeanor count of violating the federal Clean Water Act and no contest to a state pollution charge. He was fined $ 30,500.

<TEXT>
 Prosecutors contended that <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> founder <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> solicited money for lifetime partnerships at his <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> retreat and used the money for his own benefit rather than for the lodging he promised. The defense said <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> was a victim of circumstance, a devout minister who was not blessed with good business sense. Here is a look at some key points raised by the prosecution and defense.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 PROSECUTION: <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> hid information from the <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> board of directors and did not give the board a true financial picture of <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s problems. DEFENSE: <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> said the board was aware of cash flow problems and voted to borrow funds to pay for them.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 PROSECUTION: The <ORGANIZATION> Bakkers </ORGANIZATION> used <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> funds to support their lavish lifestyle, receiving more than $ 3 million in bonuses in the mid-1980s, often during periods of financial trouble for the ministry when many <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> employees were laid off. DEFENSE: <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> said the board members voted for bonuses `` of their own free will,'' adding that he accepted $ 3.1 million, less than 1 percent of what he raised for the ministry. __ PROSECUTION: <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> was creating `` a false sense of urgency'' in 1984 when he told viewers that 50 percent of the 25,000 partnerships at Heritage Grand Hotel were taken when computer records showed fewer than 4,000 had been bought. DEFENSE: <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s computers typically ran six months behind.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 PROSECUTION: Former top <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> aide <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Taggert </PERSON> testified that <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> had him relay instructions to divert Lifetime Partnership money to <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>'s general expenses. DEFENSE: <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> said <PERSON> Taggert </PERSON> was lying.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 PROSECUTION: <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> fleeced followers by overselling `` lifetime partnerships.'' Lifetime partners paid $ 1,000 for an annual guarantee of three night and four days at <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION>. DEFENSE: Partnerships were not sales transactions and the payments were gifts to the ministry. The ministry had adequate facilities to handle more than 150,000 partnerships already sold.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 PROSECUTION: Called witnesses who said they were turned away when they tried to use their lodging benefits. DEFENSE: Countered by calling to testify `` lifetime partners'' who said they never had trouble getting space in Heritage USA facilities.
</TEXT>
<TEXT>
 PROSECUTION: Backing the contention that <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> dipped into <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> funds for personal use, former <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> executive <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Dortch </PERSON> testified that <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> authorized a $ 265,000 payoff in <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> funds to <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON> <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON> to keep her quiet about their sexual encounter. DEFENSE: A former builder for <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> <PERSON> Messner </PERSON>, who handled the payment to Miss <PERSON> Hahn </PERSON>, testified that when he asked <PERSON> Dortch </PERSON> if <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> knew about the payment, <PERSON> Dortch </PERSON> replied: `` No, I'm acting on my own.''

 Elements of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s military attempted to overthrow Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> for the second time in 18 months Tuesday, but loyalist troops defeated them. Here is an account of the failed coup, compiled from reports by <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> reporters on the scene and in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>:

<TEXT>
 The first sign of the uprising comes at 7 a.m., when gunshots sound through the poor, crowded <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> neighborhood of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chorillo </LOCATION>. The Urraca battalion, entrusted with the security of Panamanian Defense Forces headquarters, is in revolt. The sounds are heard at the headquarters of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>, less than a mile away. Hundreds of people living near the embattled headquarters leave or are forced from their homes, some fleeing with pets and all the household belongings they can carry. Police, armored personnel carriers and water cannon block the streets, keeping journalists and the curious away. Shops pull down their shutters. At 7:20 a.m., the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> puts its troops and civilians on the highest alert. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, is informed. Gunfire crackles through the morning. Stray bullets hit buildings in the neighborhood, but no civilian injuries are reported. The <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> says doctors have been called to the compound. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops in combat gear take up positions 600 yards from the Defense Forces headquarters, between the gunfire and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bases. However, they take no part in the fighting. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> helicopter gunships and Blackhawk troop carriers fly over the installations. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops and armored personnel carriers close the Bridge of the <LOCATION> Americas </LOCATION>, which crosses the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> west of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. As the morning wears on, <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> adviser Brent Scowcroft briefs <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and visiting President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. Former Panamanian Ambassador <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sosa </PERSON>, also in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, says discontented officers who were passed over for recent promotions were attempting the coup. Meanwhile, troops loyal to <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> are moving out of their barracks. Battalion 2000, named for the year <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> is to gain control of the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION>, leaves <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Cimarron </LOCATION>, 25 miles east of the city; the Machos de Monte come from <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hato </LOCATION>, 55 miles west. At 11:30 a.m., as sporadic gunfire continues, the rebels issue their first and only communique in the name of Maj. <PERSON> Moises </PERSON> <PERSON> Giraldi </PERSON> <PERSON> Vega </PERSON>, commander of the Urraca battalion. In a radio broadcast, the rebels say <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and six of his top colonels have been ousted. The rebels call on other <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> units to join them and say they will call elections soon. Opposition supporters hit the streets to celebrate, waving flags and blowing whistles, but half an hour later officers loyal to <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> call a television station and say they are fighting back `` ready to give their lives.'' Troops loyal to <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> have climbed to the rooftops outside the compound to bombard rebel soldiers with mortars, grenades and gunfire. The Urraca unit returns the fire. At about 12:30 p.m. machine gun, bazooka and mortar fire rips through the neighborhood. A rocket crashes into a building, setting it afire, and anti-aircraft weapons fire wildly. People run screaming in the street. The sound of the crossfire is punctuated by a man who yells, `` Stop sinning. Christ is the salvation.'' <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s forces are in control by about 1 p.m., although sporadic firing in the area continues for at least three hours. Captured rebel soldiers are lined up with their hands on their heads; one is almost stripped naked. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> says the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has good relations with the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> and its only argument is with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. He also says the coup attempt is not `` some American operation.'' By 3 p.m., <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> spokesmen say the coup attempt has been put down and the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> have confirmed their loyalty to the general. <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> spokesman Maj. <PERSON> Edgardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> says several people were wounded but says there were no deaths. He says at least 60 soldiers and four or five officers have been detained. The government announces an 8 p.m.-5 a.m. curfew. People flock to grocery stores, stocking up on supplies in case the situation deteriorates. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> admits he is disappointed that the coup failed. At about 4 p.m., <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> and tells a national television audience the coup attempt was part of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>' `` permanent aggression'' against <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> He says all parts of the country are under control. As darkness begins to fall, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> emerges from the headquarters compound and waves to reporters. The fate of the rebels is unknown.

 I was in an apartment building overlooking the Defense Forces headquarters, trying to get a telephone line to report on the coup attempt against Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. After waiting half an hour, I finally got a line, but then there was a loud explosion. People began screaming and throwing themselves onto the floor. An old woman hugged her poodle. The telephone line went dead. About 100 yards away, troops loyal to <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> had reached Defense Forces headquarters, captured five hours earlier by dissident troops trying to oust him. At 12:30 p.m. Tuesday, they began exchanging fire with machine guns, bazookas and mortars. Some loyalist troops were behind roadblocks along the normally busy street in front of the bayside barracks. Others advanced through a graveyard on one side of the barracks, hiding behind the tombstones. The shooting went on for half an hour, and the sky filled with gunsmoke. The sound of the battle was punctuated by a religious fanatic who kept crying: `` Sin no more! Christ is salvation!'' Residents who had not evacuated the crowded slum apartment buildings in the <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chorrillo </LOCATION> neighborhood screamed in panic. Some officers ordered them out, but others told them not to go outside. They did n't know what to do. About 10 minutes after the battle began, I looked out the window and saw a rocket crash into a nearby building. Shrieking people were running down the sidewalk. Then the shooting stopped. One soldier was captured by loyalist troops on the street outside the long, low wall that surrounds the Defense Headquarters compound. They took away his weapon and stripped him almost naked before taking him inside, hands on his head. Life slowly returned to the Avenue of the Martyrs. `` Chicha, chichime,'' cried a soft drink vendor, peddling fruit drinks only an hour after the heavy firing had ended. I looked to where the roadblocks had stood. They had disappeared as if by magic. There was still some shooting in the neighborhood, however. A few hours later, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> strolled down the bullet-pocked steps of Defense Forces headquarters. He raised his right hand, smiled and waved.

<HEAD>Dollar Falls Against Yen in Tokyo, Stocks Rise Slightly</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The dollar declined against the Japanese yen today amid apparent massive dollar-selling by central banks, while the key index on the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> rose slightly. The dollar closed at 140.60, down 0.05 yen from Tuesday's close. It had opened at 141.05 and climbed as high as 141.85 yen at one point. The day's low was 140.50 yen. The Nikkei Stock Average rose 16.43 points, or 0.05 percent, to 35,382.80, reversing its fall in the morning. Volume was 850 million shares. The dollar's early gains in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> followed an upswing on overseas markets overnight, traders said. In the morning, banks from <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> bought West German marks for yen, sending the dollar upward, while traders virtually ignored <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> intervention aimed at keeping the dollar down, said <PERSON> Minori </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeuchi </PERSON>, a trader at <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. `` But in the afternoon, the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> again intervened and there were rumors of intervention by the Bank of <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> and the -LRB- German -RRB- <ORGANIZATION> Bundesbank </ORGANIZATION>, causing the dollar to decline gradually,'' she said. `` We think the central banks sold huge amounts of dollars,'' she said. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s central bank does not comment on its exchange market activities. On the stock exchange, the 225-issue Nikkei average lost 13.41 points, falling to 35,352.96 within the first 15 minutes of morning trading. It had lost 256.60 points the previous day. The index rose gradually in the afternoon, but dealers said there was no clear direction. <PERSON> Takahide </PERSON> <PERSON> Furuhashi </PERSON>, head of analysis at <ORGANIZATION> DB </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Markets </ORGANIZATION>, said that across the board, companies with large capitalization were sold in favor of smaller companies. He said buyers were `` looking for low price-earnings multiples.'' Companies holding land in <LOCATION> Osaka </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nagoya </LOCATION>, where land prices have been rising, were popular issues, he said. `` The market is still watching interest rates. Yesterday, the market was worried about an interest rate hike in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, and I think it is still concerned today,'' said <PERSON> Takeshi </PERSON> <PERSON> Yamamoto </PERSON>, head of research at <ORGANIZATION> Barclays </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zoete </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wedd </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>. He said shares of companies thought to have hidden assets, such as warehousing firms and private railways, were doing well, while retailers were still slumping following Tuesday's announcement by <ORGANIZATION> Shuwa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> that it was selling its shares in the Life store chain. `` Supermarkets had been bought heavily on merger and acquisition stories, led by <ORGANIZATION> Shuwa </ORGANIZATION>,'' which earlier this year made highly publicized bids for smaller chains, <PERSON> Yamamoto </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 European foreign ministers have backed a $ 650 million package of aid for the struggling economies of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. `` The process of political and economic reform in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> has progressed considerably,'' said the ministers of the 12-nation European Community. `` However, the process remains fragile and could be weakened by economic difficulties,'' they said in a statement issued Tuesday at the end of daylong talks on foreign policy issues. The aid package was unveiled last week as part of Western efforts to help the Eastern European countries reform their economies. British Foreign Secretary <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Major </PERSON> said it was `` very desirable'' to help the two countries, but said they must make economic reforms to sustain their societies. The West wants to encourage the push in both countries for broader economic and political reforms. In July, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and heads of other leading democracies asked the European Community to coordinate economic aid for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. They also urged emergency food shipments for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. At Tuesday's meeting, the foreign ministers endorsed a plan by the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, the trading bloc's executive body, to add about $ 220 million to next year's budget to help the two countries. They also supported other elements of the plan, which included agricultural aid, reducing trade restrictions, direct investment, professional training and pollution control. Half of the $ 650 million cost of the plan would be paid for by the community nations, and half would come from the other 12 nations including that <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> that are taking part in the drive. The foreign ministers also urged that higher-level officials of the 24 nations meet soon `` to ensure that sufficient momentum is maintained'' in the Poland-Hungary push. President <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> sent a letter in July to community officials asking for 685,000 tons of beef, pork, powdered milk, butter, oils, wheat, corn, rice and sugar in the coming months. He also said <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> would need at least 3.7 million tons of food next year and again in 1991.

<TEXT>
 The $ 100 million libel trial of Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist <PERSON> Seymour </PERSON> <PERSON> Hersh </PERSON> is nearing its end after a federal judge denied a defense motion to dismiss the case. Closing arguments were expected to begin this morning, said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Nussbaum </PERSON>, one of <PERSON> Hersh </PERSON>'s attorneys. On Tuesday, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Norgle </PERSON> denied a request to drop the case brought by former Indian Prime Minister <PERSON> Morarji </PERSON> <PERSON> Desai </PERSON>. The judge ruled that <PERSON> Desai </PERSON>'s attorneys had presented enough evidence to allow the six-member jury to decide the case. <PERSON> Desai </PERSON> contends <PERSON> Hersh </PERSON>, 52, libeled him in his 1983 book on former Secretary of State <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON>, `` The Price of Power.'' <PERSON> Hersh </PERSON> wrote that <PERSON> Desai </PERSON> was a paid informant for the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> and a valuable `` asset'' to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government during the <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> administrations. To prove libel, <PERSON> Desai </PERSON>'s attorneys must convince the jury that <PERSON> Hersh </PERSON> knowingly printed false, negligent or malicious material about <PERSON> Desai </PERSON>. <PERSON> Desai </PERSON>, 94, is seeking $ 100 million in damages. He is too ill to attend the trial, however. Videotaped excerpts from his 81-hour deposition were shown to the jury. <PERSON> Hersh </PERSON> testified that six `` high level'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government sources told him <PERSON> Desai </PERSON> was a <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> asset. <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON> testified Monday that he did n't believe <PERSON> Desai </PERSON> was a <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> informant. But under cross-examination by <PERSON> Hersh </PERSON>'s attorneys, he acknowledged he could n't be sure of that because he was n't told the names of the agency's informants. <PERSON> Hersh </PERSON> won his Pulitzer for international reporting in 1970 for his coverage of the My Lai massacre in <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Desai </PERSON>, a bitter political rival of the late Indian Prime Minister <PERSON> Indira </PERSON> <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>, headed the country's government from 1977 to 1979. In his book, <PERSON> Hersh </PERSON> contends that <PERSON> Desai </PERSON> supplied information to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> because he opposed Mrs. <PERSON> Gandhi </PERSON>'s policy of maintaining close ties with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and plans for the 1971 invasion of <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 A second type of deadly AIDS virus has reached the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>, where it was found in a West African man who often failed to wear condoms when he had sex with 20 to 40 women here since 1979, officials say. `` This is the first case of HIV-2 to our knowledge in the western <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' said Dr. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Ho </PERSON>, director of the AIDS virology laboratory at <ORGANIZATION> Cedars-Sinai </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. HIV-2 _ or human immunodeficiency virus type 2 _ is common in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, but very rare in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, where almost all of more than 105,000 AIDS cases were caused by the HIV-1 type. The infected man, a <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> resident who moved here from <LOCATION> Sierra </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Leone </LOCATION> in 1979, has n't developed AIDS, and chances are low that he infected his lovers, said Dr. <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerndt </PERSON>, AIDS epidemiology director at <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>. Until now, only seven cases of HIV-2 infection had been confirmed in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>: three in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> and one each in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, said Dr. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON>, an epidemiologist at the national <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION>. Three of those people developed AIDS. Six other people believed to be infected with HIV-2 have been identified in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state, including five in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> said by phone from <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. Almost all the patients imported the virus from <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, he said. <PERSON> Kerndt </PERSON> said the HIV-2-infected <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> man had 20 to 40 sexual contacts since moving here. But <PERSON> Kerndt </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ho </PERSON> said the possibility the man infected his partners is relatively low because he has low levels of HIV-2 in his bloodstream. The man, whose identity was withheld, `` had multiple unprotected sexual contacts over a long period of time'' with one woman, <PERSON> Kerndt </PERSON> said. Yet she has been tested and is not infected with the virus. `` That is reassuring,'' <PERSON> Kerndt </PERSON> said. A second woman also is uninfected, but officials expect to locate only two or three more of the women, <PERSON> Kerndt </PERSON> said. The man is in his 30s, works full-time and attends school part-time. He has refrained from sex since learning three months ago he might be infected with HIV-2, <PERSON> Ho </PERSON> said. `` This man is a pretty decent person,'' he added. `` He's had a couple of traceable contacts and they are negative -LRB- AIDS-free -RRB-. But he had multiple other non-traceable contacts _ one-night stands. He's fully cooperative, but he does n't know these other women he had casual sex with. ... He used condoms occasionally, but on other occasions he did n't.''

<TEXT>
 A powerful bomb exploded in a congested shopping district of the capital today, killing five people and injuring 13, police said. Two of the dead were young sisters. The blast that rocked the <ORGANIZATION> Sadar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bazaar </ORGANIZATION> in northern <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION> apparently stemmed from a land feud that has been simmering between two families for more than a quarter century, residents said. Four of the victims belonged to the family of <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Razak </PERSON>, the 65-year-old operator of a motor scooter stand who owns the land. His wife, sister and two granddaughters, ages 4 and 8, died in the blast. The other victim was not immediately identified, but authorities said he was probably a customer. Meedan Bee, the mother of the two children, beat her chest as she repeatedly cried: `` Allah, I lifted the bodies of my two daughters with my own hands. One did n't even have a face.'' The bomb was concealed in a plastic container, wrapped in cloth and hidden under a wooden canopy where <PERSON> Razak </PERSON>'s relatives were sitting, police said. It exploded at about 10:05 a.m., they said. `` It was terrible. I saw ears, limbs and necks strewn around,'' said <PERSON> Satish </PERSON> <PERSON> Saxena </PERSON>, a local politician who went to inspect the scene. A blood-soaked plastic doll that was partially burned lay at the end of the parking lot. A canvas thatch over the scooter stand had come down. The wooden canopy, shattered into pieces, was black. A sobbing <PERSON> Razak </PERSON> said the land dispute probably triggered the blast. He said a neighboring shopkeeper has been trying to occupy the land and that the feud has been in court for 25 to 30 years. Police could not confirm the allegation. But a senior official said, `` We are investigating all angles.'' Today's explosion was the second to rock the capital in four months. A powerful bomb exploded in the capital's main railroad station in June, killing eight people and injuring 53. Police blamed Sikh militants demanding a separate homeland in northern <LOCATION> Punjab </LOCATION> state.

<TEXT>
 Three black men convicted in separate murder cases were hanged today at <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION> Central Prison, raising to 42 the number of executions in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> so far this year. None of the killings had been depicted as having political overtones, although anti-apartheid activists and human rights lawyers have been campaigning for a moratorium on all executions. Two mixed-race men were hanged on Friday, the first executions since mid-July and the first approved by President F.W. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON> during his seven weeks in power. One of them, <PERSON> Mangena </PERSON> <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesman </PERSON>, was a member of the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla movement, and was hanged despite a clemency appeal from the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. Two of the prisoners hanged this year were white, the rest black or mixed-race. The number of executions is far lower than in previous years, such as 1987, when a record 164 people were executed. The government says 54 condemned prisoners have received reprieves this year. More than 200 prisoners, nearly all of them black men, remain on Death Row.

 An ex-Navy flier is under investigation in the bombing of a van driven by the wife of <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Capt. <PERSON> Will </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, but said he is n't responsible for act, the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> reported today. `` I did n't do it and I do n't know who did it,'' said <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Marxmiller </PERSON> a commercial pilot for <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> who now lives in <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Oconee </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ga. </LOCATION> `` But they suspect I know who did it. -LRB- Yet -RRB- to think I would do something like this is utter nonsense. It's so out of character. It does n't compute.'' The interview was conducted earlier this week in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, the newspaper said. As skipper of the USS Vincennes, <ORGANIZATION> Rogers </ORGANIZATION> gave the July 1988 order to shoot down what turned out to be an Iranian jetliner. All 290 people aboard the plane were killed. <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> later was exonerated on grounds he had reason to believe his ship was under attack as it patrolled the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> during the Iran-Iraq War. Investigators originally believed the March 10 bombing of <ORGANIZATION> Rogers </ORGANIZATION>' van in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> was done by terrorists in retaliation for the attack. <PERSON> Roger </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON>, narrowly escaped injury when the pipe planted in the van exploded at a busy intersection. Federal investigators changed their thinking on the case when <PERSON> Marxmiller </PERSON>'s name emerged, the Times said. It reported that multiple sources had confirmed that <PERSON> Marxmiller </PERSON> is now the leading individual under investigation in the case. The special agent in charge of the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> has refused to comment on the investigation. <PERSON> Marxmiller </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> said they had met only once, several years ago, and that they had not seen each other since. `` I dimly remember the guy,'' <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> said. `` I have no idea why he would be involved in this thing. And I have no other comment.'' <PERSON> Marxmiller </PERSON> adamantly denied having a personal vendetta against <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> or a desire to hurt him or his family. `` I do n't have anything against the guy,'' he said. <PERSON> Marxmiller </PERSON> said he had taken two polygraph tests since the summer and was asked whether he was involved in the bombing. <PERSON> Marxmiller </PERSON> said he believed he failed a question in the second test about whether he had planned the bombing or knew who placed the bomb under the van. He said the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> also has asked for his fingerprints and a photograph and has interviewed his brother extensively about their whereabouts around the time of the bombing. <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> officials also seemed interested in the fact that <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>' name is among three dozen people listed as witnesses on behalf of <PERSON> Marxmiller </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Rebecca </PERSON>, who is suing for divorce in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, according to the newspaper Neither <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Marxmiller </PERSON> nor <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> could explain why <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>' name was listed as a witness.

 Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> is in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> for talks, but an official report said he and President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> would not discuss Soviet aid to the leftist government. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> arrived Tuesday for the 24-hour visit, saying he brought a message for <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> from President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and the Soviet leadership. He did not immediately disclose its contents. `` We attribute great importance to these conversations ... in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>, at such a transcendental stage when a new era, a peaceful era for the Nicaraguan revolution is to begin,'' <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said. `` We support it, and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> would like to contribute to this historic cause.'' <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>, the highest-ranking Soviet official to visit <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, was scheduled to meet today with <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> and the leadership of the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, which seized power in a 1979 revolution from rightist President <PERSON> Anastasio </PERSON> <PERSON> Somoza </PERSON>.

The newspaper listed Soviet aid to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> at $ 11.2 billion from 1980 to 1988. According to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government figures, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has been giving <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> $ 1 billion a year, half of it in military aid.

 A small dog facing a `` death penalty'' for biting a man has been released after a judge ruled that even canines have constitutional rights. <ORGANIZATION> Marion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Barber </PERSON> ruled Tuesday that the dachshund terrier named Blue Two should go free after spending 75 days at the Humane Society of <LOCATION> Willamette </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Barber </PERSON> said the county has a right to confiscate a dog in the interest of public safety but that right `` can not be exercised with total disregard of what we consider to be due process of law.'' <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Cannon </PERSON>, the county's legal counsel, predicted the ruling will prevent the county from enforcing state law in all future dog-bite cases. But the defense attorney for the dog's owners said the decision shows that county animal control ordinances need to be changed. `` Blue Two obviously was not one of those dangerous dogs,'' said attorney <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Todd </PERSON>, who represents <PERSON> Vic </PERSON> and <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Parkison </PERSON>. <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Parkison </PERSON> greeted her pet with tears in her eyes.

 Dr. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Baltimore </PERSON>, a Nobel Prize winner who helped write a research paper that has been challenged as fraudulent, has been offered the presidency of <ORGANIZATION> Rockefeller </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. Some `` very strong members of the faculty'' criticized the choice, said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Furlaud </PERSON>, a co-chairman of a committee of <ORGANIZATION> Rockefeller </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> trustees that searched for a new president. <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>, a 51-year-old molecular biologist who shared the 1975 Nobel Prize in medicine for cancer research, has not been accused of wrongdoing in the paper. He would succeed Dr. <PERSON> Joshua </PERSON> <PERSON> Lederberg </PERSON> as head of the graduate university, which specializes in biomedical research and training. <PERSON> Lederberg </PERSON> will turn 65 years old, the mandatory retirement age, in May. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations were investigating charges that a paper signed by <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> and five other authors was not supported by the data.

<TEXT>
 More than 8,000 people proclaiming themselves the voice of the unborn rallied at the Capitol after a legislator introduced a measure that would impose broad restrictions on abortion in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>. `` I was told last week it was a <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> issue. I was told last week it was a women's issue. I was told last week it was a Bible-belt issue,'' state Rep. <PERSON> Gerard </PERSON> <PERSON> Kosinski </PERSON> told the crowd, referring to a smaller rally by pro-choice activists a week earlier. `` The bottom line is it's a human issue.'' Earlier Tuesday, Rep. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Freind </PERSON> unveiled a bill designed to challenge the 1973 <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roe </ORGANIZATION> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> ruling that gave women the right to abortion. Among other things, it would require a 24-hour waiting period before an abortion; ban all abortions after the 24th week of pregnancy except to save the woman's life; ban abortions used for choosing the sex of a child; and require that a husband be notified before a woman has an abortion in most cases. Freind's bill, backed by Democratic Gov. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Casey </PERSON>, could be the first to be adopted in the nation since the high court in July endorsed <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>'s right to put more modest restrictions on abortions. At a news conference, <PERSON> Freind </PERSON> said the bill could give the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> a chance to overturn <PERSON> Roe </PERSON>. Later, the Republican lawmaker was cheered at the rally by about 8,500 people, including activists from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION>. They held signs saying `` The unborn need freedom too,'' and `` Pro choice means pro murder,'' and closed the rally by launching red, white and blue balloons. <PERSON> Maggie </PERSON> <PERSON> D'Alesio </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> nurse who said she witnessed the death of an aborted fetus that lived for 90 minutes after the operation, said one person can make a difference. `` These unborn babies have no one but us to cry out for them,'' she said. `` Let us make sure we are heard.'' Freind's bill has the support of more than 70 co-sponsors, some of whom joined him at the news conference and rally. He said he expected his proposal to pass the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> and move to the governor by early next month. Also Tuesday, abortion rights advocates formally introduced their legislative package. It includes a proposed constitutional amendment outlining a woman's right to have an abortion. The package also would restore government funding for poor women who have `` medically necessary'' abortions, and weaken a state law requiring parental notification or a court order before a minor can obtain an abortion. That provision is not in effect because it is being reviewed by a court. In <LOCATION> Madison </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wis. </LOCATION>, a legislative committee recommended approval of a measure to repeal an obsolete <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION> law establishing prison penalties for women who have abortions and doctors who perform them. On the other side of the issue, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> on Tuesday proposed criminal penalties for individuals who operate abortion clinics without a license. He also wants to give the <ORGANIZATION> state </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> authority </ORGANIZATION> to close and fine clinics that are not in compliance.

 Actor <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurt </PERSON> expressed thanks after a judge ruled against his ex-lover, who claimed half of his wealth as his common-law wife. But her attorney vowed an appeal, saying the female judge was `` madly in love'' with Hurt. Tuesday's ruling was `` a vindication of everything I have said,'' the 39-year-old Oscar-winning actor said in a statement. He said he went to court because `` I felt that I simply could not continually give in to the pressures that have been constantly put on me for more and more money and other accommodations from <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON> and others.'' In an interview published today in The Middlesex -LRB- Mass. -RRB- News, <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON> blasted Judge <PERSON> Jacqueline </PERSON> <PERSON> Silbermann </PERSON>, who issued the ruling. `` I think she was star-struck and I think she did n't use her intelligence,'' said <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON>, a native of <LOCATION> Framingham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON>, 32, based her lawsuit on four of the 10 weeks she spent with Hurt in <LOCATION> Beaufort </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, during the winter of 1982-83 while he was there filming `` The Big Chill,'' a hit movie about a reunion of 1960s-era college chums. Common-law marriages were abolished in 1933 in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> state </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON> and Hurt lived, but <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> is one of 13 states, along with the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, that recognize such unions. <PERSON> Silbermann </PERSON>, of the trial level state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>, ruled that although <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON> lived with Hurt and had a child with him, living together did not constitute a marriage. <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON> met Hurt in <LOCATION> Saratoga </LOCATION> in 1981 when he was a 31-year-old rising star and she a 24-year-old dancer with the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ballet </LOCATION>. Less than a year later, she was pregnant. The couple arrived in <LOCATION> Beaufort </LOCATION> on Oct. 31, 1982, and <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON> contended that a common-law marriage existed between Dec. 9, when Hurt learned <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Beth </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurt </PERSON> had divorced him, and Jan. 10, when <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hurt </PERSON> left the state. She said <PERSON> Hurt </PERSON> resisted formalizing the union, telling her they had a `` spiritual'' marriage and were `` married in the eyes of God.'' <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON>' lawyer, <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Golub </PERSON>, said he would immediately appeal the decision, claiming <PERSON> Silbermann </PERSON> was `` madly in love'' with Hurt. `` Let five judges who are all men decide this, not one woman who is impressed by a movie star,'' <PERSON> Golub </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Silbermann </PERSON> last year presided over <PERSON> Golub </PERSON>'s divorce from actress <PERSON> Marisa </PERSON> <PERSON> Berenson </PERSON>, a settlement he has said he was happy with. <PERSON> Silbermann </PERSON>'s ruling in the Hurt-Jennings case came about three months after a two-week, non-jury trial that was punctuated by angry outbursts, and more than five years after <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON> walked out on Hurt. In court and in impromptu corridor news conferences, <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON> said Hurt was physically and emotionally abusive. She told reporters Hurt had beaten her, spat on her and called her vulgar names. <PERSON> Silbermann </PERSON>'s decision did not deal with financial support for <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON> and the couple's 6-year-old son, <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Devon </PERSON> <PERSON> Hurt </PERSON>. Hurt pays $ 60,000 to $ 65,000 a year to <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON> and the boy. Before the trial, he refused to increase the amount and <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON> petitioned for $ 16,000 a month, which <PERSON> Silbermann </PERSON> rejected. Had the case gone in <PERSON> Jennings </PERSON>' favor, she would have been entitled to a hearing and ruling on how much Hurt should give her from his assets _ up to half of what he has earned since the time they were together. In addition to `` The Big Chill,'' Hurt has starred in `` Body Heat,'' `` Children of a Lesser God,'' `` Kiss of the Spider Woman,'' `` Broadcast News'' and `` The Accidental Tourist.'' He won an Oscar in 1986 for `` Spider Woman.'' Last March, Hurt married <PERSON> Heidi </PERSON> <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON>, daughter of bandleader <PERSON> Skitch </PERSON> <PERSON> Henderson </PERSON>. They had a son, <PERSON> Sam </PERSON>, in August.

<HEAD>AIDS Worries Means Gays Can No Longer Donate Sperm in New York</HEAD>

 New state rules requiring donors to sperm banks to undergo two AIDS tests and barring homsexual men and intravenous drug users from donating were welcomed by the director of one bank. `` In order to minimize the risks of transmission and increase the safety to recipients, we have to get some controls over who the sperm donors are,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Grace </PERSON> <PERSON> Centola </PERSON>, who runs a sperm bank at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rochester </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>. The first question asked by patients seeking sperm from an anonymous donor is invariably about the danger of contracting acquired immune deficiency syndrom, she said Tuesday. The regulations that took effect Monday also require for the first time that sperm banks be licensed by the state. Donors are required to undergo two separate AIDS tests, the second one six months after the sperm has been donated and frozen, said <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardineer </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> associate director for regulatory affairs. The regulations exclude a person from donating if he's had any homosexual activity, intravenous drug use or sex with a person thought to be at high risk for AIDS since 1977. The same people already are barred from donating blood, <PERSON> Gardineer </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> have documented no cases of transmission of the AIDS virus through donated sperm in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, a spokesman said. <PERSON> Gardineer </PERSON> said there's been one case of an Australian man who tested positive for the AIDS virus after donating sperm to eight women. Four of the women later tested positive for the virus, but three of their babies born through artificial insemination were healthy, <PERSON> Gardineer </PERSON> said. The fourth pregnancy never came to term. AIDS is caused by a virus that damages the body's immune system, leaving victims susceptible to infections and cancer. It is spread most often through sex, needles or syringes shared by drug abusers, infected blood and from pregnant women to their offspring. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state's 25,000 confirmed AIDS cases is about one-quarter of the nation's total. <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Knox </PERSON>, a spokesman for the Gay Men's Health Crisis, said he had no problem with the prohibition against homosexual men. In 1987, about 30,000 women in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> were impregnated through the use of anonymous donor sperm, <PERSON> Centola </PERSON> said. Gardineer could n't be sure of just how many sperm banks there are in the state because they have n't been licensed in the past. The new rules do n't apply in cases where a person is donating sperm for a specific person, such as his wife.

 About 500 students, angry at what they said were racist remarks by a history teacher, rampaged at their high school and forced the administration to close it early, police said. One police officer was injured and four students were charged with disorderly conduct Tuesday after the incident at <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>. About 100 police officers were summoned to help send students home when more than 1,000 students milled in front of the building after officials closed it. A policewoman was hit in the head with a thrown bottle and slightly injured, police said. `` They were kids and they were a little hot under the collar, but by and large, they were an easy group to deal with,'' Deputy Chief <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Gallagher </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Nick </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, 16, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Turpin </PERSON>, 16, <PERSON> Deshane </PERSON> <PERSON> Smart </PERSON>, 18, and a 15-year-old student whose identity was not released because of his age were charged with disorderly conduct, <PERSON> Gallagher </PERSON> said. Smart also was charged with resisting arrest. Damage in the school consisted of `` a couple of display cases that were broken and a few fluorescent light bulbs that were broken,'' <PERSON> Gallagher </PERSON> said. The students were angry over a remark allegedly made by <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldstein </PERSON>, a white social-studies teacher. <PERSON> Noel </PERSON> <PERSON> Kriftcher </PERSON>, superintendent of <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Staten </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> schools, said <PERSON> Goldstein </PERSON> told his class last Thursday that American blacks, while concerned about racism in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, were less concerned about the plight of blacks in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> African </LOCATION> nations. `` Then he said something about blacks being backward in those countries,'' <PERSON> Kriftcher </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teachers </ORGANIZATION> released a statement by <PERSON> Goldstein </PERSON> saying he lectured about atrocities committed by East African dictators on blacks and that `` no students objected at the time to the lesson.'' Students said <PERSON> Goldstein </PERSON> used racial slurs when addressing students. `` He always made racist remarks,'' said <PERSON> Nelta </PERSON> <PERSON> Cajigas </PERSON>, 17. About 75 percent of the school's 3,100 students are Hispanic and 22 percent are black, said <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Sobrino </PERSON>. About 50 students met with the school's principal in the auditorium Tuesday to voice their dissatisfaction. Eventually, the group grew to about 500 students who began rampaging through hallways breaking glass, <PERSON> Gallagher </PERSON> said. Schools Chancellor <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecklowitz </PERSON> toured the school and directed that <PERSON> Goldstein </PERSON> be re-assigned to a district office pending an investigation, <PERSON> Sobrino </PERSON> said.

 Rev. <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Falwell </PERSON> said evangelist <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> should n't blame him for the collapse of <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> because the damage to the bankrupt ministry took place before he assumed control, a newspaper reported.

 A gunman ambushed and killed the leader of <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>'s Jewish community, and authorities today were investigating whether the attack was anti-Semitic. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s ambassador to <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION> speculated that neo-Nazis were behind the shooting of Dr. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Wybran </PERSON> Tuesday evening. `` This was a terrorist attack. There is no doubt about that,'' said a police official on condition of anonymity. He did not elaborate. Wybran, 49, was shot in the head as he got into his car outside <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> <LOCATION> University </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>, where he headed the immunology department, police said. A hospital spokesman said he died early today. No one has claimed responsibility for the slaying. `` It is impossible to determine the precise motive,'' for the shooting, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Peytier </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> prosecutor's office, told reporters. `` But given the nature of his -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Wybran </ORGANIZATION>'s -RRB- activities, it can not be excluded that this was a political attack.'' Prime Minister <PERSON> Wilfried </PERSON> <PERSON> Martens </PERSON>, in a statement, called the act `` revolting and wretched'' and expressed his `` indignation at violence and intolerance.'' In addition to heading the country' Jewish community, <PERSON> Wybran </PERSON> chaired of the Belgian <ORGANIZATION> Auschwitz </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. The committee recently urged <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s Roman Catholic primate, Cardinal <PERSON> Jozef </PERSON> <PERSON> Glemp </PERSON>, to remove an order of Carmelite nuns from a convent on the perimeter of the former <LOCATION> Auschwitz </LOCATION> death camp in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. Wybran had recently returned from <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, where he urged authorities to publicly oppose racism and anti-Semitism. Jewish leaders complained the convent and its religious symbols were offensive at a site where 2.5 million Jews were killed as part of <PERSON> Adolf </PERSON> <PERSON> Hitler </PERSON>'s campaign to exterminate European Jews during World War II. Police said they have found no witnesses to the attack. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s ambassador to <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Avi </PERSON> <PERSON> Primor </PERSON>, told <ORGANIZATION> Israeli </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> he has been in touch with authorities to discuss the attack and security for embassy staff and Jews in <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>. He speculated that among those behind the shooting were neo-Nazis. `` These of course have a lot of reason to be angry with Professor <PERSON> Wybran </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Primor </PERSON> said. `` He was one of the initiators of the campaign to remove the Carmelite monastery from <LOCATION> Auschwitz </LOCATION>.'' Police said <PERSON> Wybran </PERSON> was apparently ambushed by a gunman from behind <PERSON> Wybran </PERSON>'s car in the hospital parking lot. He had been on his way to a ceremony at the university's <ORGANIZATION> Martin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Buber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, a Jewish Studies school. In December, <PERSON> Wybran </PERSON> became head of the <ORGANIZATION> Coordinating </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organizations </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, which represents about 30,000 Jews from 30 different groups. Until last year, he was head of the <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> chapter of B'nai B'rith, the Jewish charity and social organization. There have been several anti-Semitic attacks in <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION> in recent years. In July 1980, a grenade exploded as 50 Jewish teen-agers were about to take a bus to summer camp. One teen-ager died. On Oct. 20, 1981, two people died when a van packed with explosives blew up outside an <LOCATION> Antwerp </LOCATION> synagogue. On Sept. 18, 1982, four people were injured when gunmen sprayed a <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> synagogue with automatic gunfire.

 The Cabinet today endorsed the ban on burying <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' body in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> after the defense chief briefed them on an alleged plot to assassinate President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>, officials said.

These two parties can act together.'' In a news conference after the Cabinet meeting, <PERSON> Ramos </PERSON> refused to confirm or deny <PERSON> Estanislao </PERSON>'s disclosure, saying what was taken up during the briefing was `` highly classified.'' `` We are still trying to measure if this is an empty threat or not,'' <PERSON> Ramos </PERSON> added. `` We can not afford this kind of hysteria because we are trying to attract investments in the country.'' <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' followers have been linked to several of the six armed attempts to topple Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>. But since <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' death, demonstrations by his followers have been relatively small and peaceful. Agriculture Secretary <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Dominguez </PERSON> said the Cabinet was unanimous in its support for the controversial decision, despite growing public pressure to allow <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' remains to come home. `` We have supported the president since the beginning on her stand,'' <PERSON> Dominguez </PERSON> said. `` There is no question in the <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> as to the position we are taking.'' On Tuesday, the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> agreed to consider a petition from <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' supporters to overturn the ban and gave the government 10 days to respond. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> says she will abide by the court's decision but claims <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' burial in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> could lead to civil unrest and discourage foreign investment. Mrs. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> has been prohibited from leaving the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, where she is to be tried in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> in March on charges of embezzling government money and investing some of it in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The Marcoses were indicted in October and Mrs. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> is free on $ 5 million bond.

 A woman who had been acting strangely for months fatally stabbed her two young daughters, then died after ordering her 8-year-old son to stab her with the same kitchen knife, police said. A state social worker interviewed each family member last month after <PERSON> Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>'s husband, <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON>, said she threatened to poison the children, <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rehabilitative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Ruben </PERSON> <PERSON> Betancourt </PERSON> said. The caseworker found no signs of child abuse and <PERSON> King </PERSON> refused further intervention, saying he needed his wife at home to take care of the children while he worked, <PERSON> Betancourt </PERSON> said. The attacks began Tuesday afternoon when Mrs. <PERSON> King </PERSON>, 32, became enraged at her 3-year-old daughter, police said. `` The mother ... called the little girl, <PERSON> Sara </PERSON>, into the bedroom and stabbed her, and then called her other little girl, the 4-year-old, <PERSON> Grace </PERSON>, into the bedroom, stabbed her, and they both died on the scene,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Metro-Dade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Reyes </PERSON>. `` She then turned the knife over to her son ... and told him to do to her what he had seen the mother do to the two little girls.'' <PERSON> Reyes </PERSON> said the boy, who was shivering in fear when police arrived later, initially refused his mother's command. `` Then, when he was admonished by his mother and told to do as he was told, he complied, and he stabbed his mother to death in the same bedroom that the two little girls were killed in,'' <PERSON> Reyes </PERSON> said. The 8-year-old then dialed 911. Police and firefighters who arrived at the house north of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> found the three bodies. Mrs. <PERSON> King </PERSON> had exhibited unusual behavior toward her family for several months, police said. A 6-year-old son also was in the home during the stabbings, but the father was not at home, police said. The boys and their father were taken to police headquarters for questioning. <PERSON> Reyes </PERSON> said no charges would be filed against the 8-year-old. `` Unfortunately, he did something that his mother told him to do, as any boy would do,'' <PERSON> Reyes </PERSON> said. `` He responded as his mother told him to respond ... and obviously it just hit him that he had done maybe something wrong.''

<TEXT>
 An explosion at a student hostel that may have been caused by a gas leak killed one person and seriously injured five others today, the <ORGANIZATION> Edinburgh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brigade </ORGANIZATION> said. Assistant Divisional Officer <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevenson </PERSON> said rescuers were still searching for one person who was unaccounted for but faced difficult problems `` because of the high concentration of gas in the area.'' The inside of the five-story stone building in central <LOCATION> Edinburgh </LOCATION> collapsed in the 7:30 a.m. explosion, but the roof remained hanging, held on by the two adjoining buildings, he said. Four people were taken to the hospital shortly after the explosion with serious injuries and the fifth was rescued 3 -LCB- hours later, he said. The body of the unidentified victim was then removed, he said. Deputy Fire Master <PERSON> Colin </PERSON> <PERSON> Cranston </PERSON> said rescuers were using their hands and heat-seeking cameras rather than heavy equipment for fear the roof and the exterior of the building would collapse on them. He said the rescue effort was `` very risky'' and could take several hours. <PERSON> Stevenson </PERSON> said `` there is a report of other people in the building,'' but when asked how many said `` we've no idea, really.'' Neighboring buildings were evacuated and the area sealed off by police. Passers-by were being warned not to light matches or smoke cigarettes which could ignite gas still in the air.

<HEAD>Philippine Consul Raises Possibility of Marcos Viewing at Consulate</HEAD>
<DATELINE>HONOLULU (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>' consul general here has offered to allow <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' body to lie in state at the consulate if his widow makes the request in writing and Philippine President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> consents. In an ironic twist, the body would lie in state in a room dedicated to Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>'s husband, whose 1983 assassination led to <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' downfall in a 1986 uprising that lifted Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> to power. Consul General <PERSON> Tomas </PERSON> `` Buddy'' <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON> made the offer Tuesday after a shouting match on the consulate steps with <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> supporters angry because the <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> flag was not lowered to half-staff after the former <LOCATION> Phillipine </LOCATION> president died in exile here at age 72. <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON> said he did n't order the flag lowered because he had no instructions from <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> to do so. The request for a lying-in-state at the consulate was made by <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Lazo </PERSON>, president of the Friends of <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>. He said the <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> family would agree to having <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' body in the pavilion named for <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> rival <PERSON> Benigno </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> <PERSON> `` </PERSON> <PERSON> Joe </PERSON>, you put that in writing and have that signed by the widow,'' <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON> responded, adding he would make a personal request to Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>. <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON> also said he would allow <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> to be buried temporarily at the consulate if he had Philippine and local government approval. This would satisfy the family's wish not to have <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> buried in American soil since the consulate legally is an extension of the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> was gunned down in 1983 at the <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> airport as he returned to the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> from self-imposed exile in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The slaying, which many Filipinos blamed on <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> and his supporters, galvanized the opposition. Plans are going ahead to have <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' body temporarily entombed here in hopes the <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> government eventually will allow him to be buried in his homeland, a family spokesman said. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> has refused to allow <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' body to be returned to his homeland, saying it could provoke unrest. The <ORGANIZATION> Philippines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> has agreed to consider a petition from <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> supporters to lift the ban. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' body has been on display at the family's mansion in <LOCATION> Makiki </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heights </LOCATION>, overlooking <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION>. Hundreds have visited to view the body, which will be taken Friday to a Roman Catholic cathedral for a funeral Mass. `` There's one point I want to make perfectly clear and that is, the final resting place of my father is going to be <PERSON> Ilocos </PERSON> <PERSON> Norte </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Marco </PERSON>'s home province, said his son, <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> `` Bong Bong'' Marcos Jr.. Entombing Marcos above ground would serve a symbolic purpose for the family in that the former president would not be buried in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soil, said <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON>

 Lawmakers from both parties are criticizing President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for not offering <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military aid to an attempted coup in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, but a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> said today the only <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> option is `` to let things take their course.'' `` Once again we have snatched defeat from the jaws of victory, and I think it's an outrage,'' Sen. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.C. </LOCATION>, said Tuesday. Sen. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ariz </LOCATION>., said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intervention could have made a difference in the attempted coup against Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> `` We have the absolute unilateral right to use force,'' <PERSON> DeConcini </PERSON> said. But Sen. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lugar </PERSON>, R-Ind., said of the complaints: `` It's very easy to be an armchair general `` The president finally has to think about our treaty obligations, our personnel, our relations with other countries in the Latin American hemisphere and the future of democracy in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, which can flow only from the Panamanian people making choices,'' he said today on the <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> `` Today'' program. Although the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military forces in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> were on alert, <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> officials said they only observed the fighting Tuesday between members of the <ORGANIZATION> Panama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> forces, standing by to help any Americans who might be in danger. <PERSON> Lugar </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, urged continued economic and diplomatic pressure on <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, saying the coup attempt indicated growing discontent inside that country with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. `` I have no doubt that there are going to be further attempts, there is going to be further pressure. This is not over by a long shot,'' he said. `` We have only that choice _ to let things take their course.'' Rep. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Torricelli </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.J. </LOCATION>, also urged continued economic pressure without force. `` To simply send in troops is not how democracy should be restored in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Torricelli </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, said on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Good Morning America'' program. `` It will happen and will be done the right way without causing a backlash against the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Boren </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Okla </LOCATION>., was bitter after emerging from an hour-long classified <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> briefing Tuesday on the coup attempt `` Here you have brave people in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> ... trying to rid themselves of a drug dealer and a thug who's taken over their country,'' <PERSON> Boren </PERSON> said. `` And for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, with all of our strength and force and all of our belief in democracy, to stand by ... and do nothing and allow these people to fail, personally I think is wrong.'' <PERSON> Boren </PERSON> said he had been notified early Tuesday that the coup was in progress and followed its progress throughout the day. He said 200 to 300 rebel troops had seized the Panamanian Defense Forces headquarters compound with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> inside, and had the leader `` trapped and pinned down.'' But later in the day, about 500 troops loyal to <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> surrounded the compound and freed him. The fate of those who led the revolt was unclear. No American troops or citizens were involved, <PERSON> Boren </PERSON> said. `` I'm just sorry it did n't succeed. I'm sorry there was not some way, apparently, for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to help make it succeed,'' <PERSON> Boren </PERSON> told reporters. He cited failures by the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration to use force to help <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Arturo </PERSON> <PERSON> Delvalle </PERSON> when he sought to remove <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> from power, and to help maintain order when <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> later overrode national elections to retain power for himself. Asked whether military force should have been used Tuesday, <PERSON> Boren </PERSON> said: `` My personal view is that we should have, and we did n't. ... We certainly knew at that moment where -LRB- <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> -RRB- was. He was in a physical location where perhaps he could have been served with that warrant for his arrest.'' <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has been indicted in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on drug charges. `` I think it's one thing for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to go into any other country ... and try to impose its will from the outside,'' <PERSON> Boren </PERSON> said. `` It's quite another thing when the people of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> have very clearly spoken in their free elections, and overwhelmingly want to rid themselves of this ... corrupt dictatorship. ... I do n't think it is improper at all for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> then to offer a helping hand to the <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> people.''

<HEAD>Japanese Cooperative, Ethiopians Win `Alternative Nobel Prize'</HEAD>
<DATELINE>STOCKHOLM, Sweden (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A Japanese housewives organization, Ethiopian scientists and campaigners for tribal peoples today won the Right Livelihood Award, sometimes called the Alternative Nobel Prize. The Seikatsu Club Consumers Cooperative, started by a group of housewives, was awarded the prestigious honorary prize, which carries no cash award. Four others, Dr. <PERSON> Melaku </PERSON> <PERSON> Worede </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>, the British organization <ORGANIZATION> Survival </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, and <LOCATION> Ethiopian </LOCATION> doctors <PERSON> Aklilu </PERSON> <PERSON> Lemma </PERSON> and <PERSON> Legesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolde-Yohannes </PERSON>, shared the $ 120,000 cash prize. The awards will be presented in the Swedish <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> on Dec. 9, the day before the Nobel Prize ceremonies. <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON> <PERSON> von </PERSON> <PERSON> Uexkull </PERSON>, a Swedish-German national, sold his valuable stamp collection and founded the prize 10 years ago to encourage practical solutions to everyday problems. He said it was largely `` thanks to the work of Survival International that we in the West no longer see Indians and Aboriginals as a primitive remnant.'' The laureate organization, with 5,000 members in 60 countries, was cited for its `` success in fostering public awareness of the importance of traditional people's knowledge for the future of humanity, as models of sustainability and survival.'' It works to assist tribal peoples worldwide and its aim is to `` secure the rights, livelihood and self-determination'' of tribal peoples. <PERSON> Uexkull </PERSON> said one of its successes was that `` now at least the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> pays lip service'' to respecting tribal people's right when awarding loans <PERSON> Lemma </PERSON> and Wolde-Yohannes of <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION> were cited for their scientific work on the use of the entod plant to combat a chronic and eventually fatal Third World disease, bilharzia, which afflicts more than 200 million people in 74 countries. The disease is caused by parasites that invade blood vessels. Worede, an agronomist and Ph.D. graduate from the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nebraska </ORGANIZATION>, was recognized for his creation of the <ORGANIZATION> Plant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Genetic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Addis </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ababa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ethiopia </LOCATION>. His work has included establishing `` Strategic Seeds Reserves'' of traditional seeds that can be released to farmers for planting in times of drought when other seeds are unlikely to thrive, the Right Livelihood <PERSON> Socity </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Seikatsu </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Consumers </ORGANIZATION>' Cooperative was cited as `` the most successful model of production and consumption in the industrialized world, aiming to change society by promoting self-managed and less wasteful lifestyles.'' It traces its foundation to 1965 when a single <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> housewife organized 200 women to buy 300 bottles of milk to reduce their price. It now involves 170,000 families, or about half a million people, and a business enterprise with a turnover of $ 287 million that will not handle products detrimental to the members' health or the environment, the <ORGANIZATION> Right </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Livelihood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> said. The club has also entered Japanese politics, paving the way for women in a traditionally male field, on a largely ecological, anti-nuclear platform.

 Two gunmen fatally wounded a man several yards from a primary school in north <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> today, and the <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> claimed responsibility for the attack. The <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> statement to <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> news media claimed the victim was a top member of an unidentified <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> paramilitary group.

I could feel a weak pulse, and then it faded away before the ambulance arrived,'' said <PERSON> Maeve </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyle </PERSON>, a nurse who rushed to the victim's aid. <PERSON> Alban </PERSON> <PERSON> McGuinness </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> city councilman representing the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, the province's main Catholic party, said: `` The fact that the shooting appears to have been carried out before the horrified gaze of young children going to school speaks volumes for the sick mentality of the murderers.'' Twenty years of violence have claimed 2,758 lives in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, 47 of them this year. The chief constable of the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ulster </ORGANIZATION> force, meanwhile, dismissed as `` nonsense'' a claim that a secret conspiracy existed inside his force to counter government policies that are objectionable to the province's <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> majority. <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Annesley </PERSON> said in a statement Tuesday night that since he took office in June, all officers of the 13,000-member force `` have given me their unqualified loyalty and support.'' He was reacting to a <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION> newspaper report that its deputy editor talked with a man identifying himself as spokesman for `` the Inner Circle,'' an alleged secret society inside the constabulary. The paper, the Irish News, said the unidentified man displayed secret lists of <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> suspects which could only have come from intelligence agencies. The paper said the `` Inner Circle'' claimed to be dedicated to `` the removal'' of <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> suspects and the 1985 Anglo-Irish Agreement, which went over the heads of Protestants to give the <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> a say in the running of <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Annesley </PERSON> said that despite his skepticism, he had asked for the claim to be investigated by English detectives who have been called in to conduct an independent inquiry into a series of recent leaks of intelligence documents. The almost exclusively <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> is fighting to push the British out of Protestant-dominated <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, join it with the <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> and set up an all-Ireland socialist state.

 By a 17-vote margin, residents have lifted a major barrier to plans to cut a $ 250 million highway tunnel under the <LOCATION> Berthoud </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pass </LOCATION> to this ski resort. The proposed, 4.1-mile tunnel would spare motorists from having to drive the zigzag road over the breathtaking, 11,315-foot gap and would cut 20 minutes off the 90-minute, 55-mile trip from <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> to Winter Park. Residents voted 110-93 Tuesday against a measure that would have prevented the city from extending its borrowing powers to the tunnel building authority. More than a third of the town's 600 permanent residents are registered to vote. The Berthoud Tunnel Building Authority, created by the <ORGANIZATION> Town </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, will now proceed with a $ 2 million study of the project and its environmental impact. The authority can issue bonds to be paid off with tolls. Proponents of the tunnel say many tourists are afraid to make the drive over the pass. Supporters also argue it will spur development by bringing more skiers to Winter Park, one of the nation's largest ski resorts. Opponents say that the tunnel would disrupt the quiet lifestyle that attracted many people to the area and that the price tag is too high.

 Guerrillas claimed today that they captured another key town in northwestern <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> during a massive offensive launched as <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> withdrew the last of its troops. Meanwhile, <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> government troops shelled two refugee camps run by guerrillas just inside the Thai border, forcing the evacuation of relief workers. Gen. <PERSON> Dien </PERSON> <PERSON> Del </PERSON>, acting commander of the <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, said his troops had captured the town of <LOCATION> Kandoul </LOCATION> after two days of attacks and were still advancing on another, <PERSON> Svay </PERSON> <PERSON> Chiek </PERSON>. `` Kandoul is a very big victory, we will for sure now take <PERSON> Svay </PERSON> <PERSON> Chiek </PERSON>,'' he said. The towns were among the objectives the guerrilla group cited Saturday when they announced a `` general offensive'' against the pro-Hanoi government in <LOCATION> Phnom </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Penh </LOCATION>. Western sources in this border town, speaking on condition of anonymity, said they believed <LOCATION> Kandoul </LOCATION>, 10 miles from the <LOCATION> Thai </LOCATION> frontier, had been taken. <PERSON> Dien </PERSON> <PERSON> Del </PERSON> also claimed his non-Communist guerrilla group, along with its coalition allies, had taken two government positions in the <ORGANIZATION> Ampil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oddar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Meanchey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Province </ORGANIZATION>. Western relief staff today were evacuated from Site 2 and Site 8 refugee camps on the Thai-Cambodian frontier because of nearby shelling, said a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> official in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>. He spoke on condition of anonymity. Site 2, about 30 miles north of <LOCATION> Aranyaprathet </LOCATION>, has a population of 140,000. It is the largest of the string of refugee camps on the Thai frontier that shelter about 300,000 Cambodians. It is controlled by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>. Site 8, about 60 miles south of Site 2, is controlled by the radical communist <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas. The relief worker said that as far as he knew, no shells had fallen into either of the camps. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, which claims to field more than 16,000 fighters, is loosely allied with the more powerful <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION> and a group loyal to coalition leader Prince <PERSON> Norodom </PERSON> <PERSON> Sihanouk </PERSON>. The Western sources said no government reinforcements had apparently arrived along Highway 69, which runs parallel to the Thai frontier. Towns along the highway have been the major target of the guerrilla offensive, which began after the pledged withdrawal of all Vietnamese forces from <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, which invaded <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> in 1978 and had fought the guerrillas, says it withdrew the last of its troops last week.

 The South African ambassador has a few questions for Americans, who he admits harbor `` a certain amount of hostility and antagonism'' toward his country. Thousands of Americans are receiving letters from Ambassador P.G.J. <PERSON> Koornhof </PERSON>, along with a questionnaire and a reprint of a Reader's Digest article arguing against <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic sanctions on <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. `` What is your opinion of the South African government's reforms to eliminate apartheid?'' is one of the 12 questions. Another one asks: `` In your opinion, will punitive <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sanctions promote positive political change in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>?'' Then there is this one: A recent editorial `` concluded that sanctions against <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> have increased <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dependence on the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> for strategic minerals. Does this concern you?'' `` This is routine activity for the press section,'' said <PERSON> Delarey </PERSON> <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Tonder </PERSON>, the embassy's press and information counselor. `` We try to keep our mailing list updated.'' The questionnaire also asks respondents whether they would like more information about <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, divided into four categories: social, labor, business and political. `` We try to provide objective and balanced information about our country'' when people indicate an interest, <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Tonder </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> `` share the ideals of democracy and freedom,'' <PERSON> Koornhof </PERSON>'s letter said, noting that both are committed to a free market economic system. `` We have both confronted the bitter legacy of racism, segregation and racial segregation in our societies. Like the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, we are working to correct the mistakes and injustices of our past,'' the letter said. Several thousand letters have gone out in recent months to academics, politicians, business people and public figures, he said. `` Your opinion is important to me, to my government and to <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africans </LOCATION> _ black and white _ who are striving to build a truly open and democratic society in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Koornhof </PERSON> wrote. <PERSON> Koornhof </PERSON> noted that while he has `` not been surprised to find a certain amount of hostility and antagonism toward <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'' he has also found `` a considerable reservoir of good will.'' The hostility is based `` upon the widely held misperception that my government remains committed to preserving apartheid,'' he said. `` This is not true'' as evidenced by the abolition of more than 50 discriminatory measures since 1980, <PERSON> Koornhof </PERSON> said. The newly elected government of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, headed by President F.W. <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Klerk </PERSON>, is advocating reform that would grant the country's black majority more freedom but would stop short of giving them the right to vote. <PERSON> Herman </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, assistant secretary of state for African Affairs, told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Tuesday that events in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> are sufficiently encouraging to preclude additional <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic sanctions `` at the present time.'' But in a shift from the position of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> did not rule out sanctions if additional progress is not made by next June in bringing about power-sharing talks between blacks and whites. `` If, after the next parliamentary session -LRB- next June -RRB- there is very little to show for it,'' <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> said, the administration will consult with its foreign allies and with <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> about what sanctions are appropriate. External and internal pressures are helping convince the South African government that it must `` move beyond its current position and accept fundamental change,'' he said. And in an admission never made by officials of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> added that the sanctions imposed by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in 1986 despite a veto by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> `` have played a role in stimulating new thinking within the white power structure.''

 Federal officials announced civil suits or fines today against 11 cities where local authorities allegedly allowed untreated toxic industrial wastes into public sewage systems. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> lawsuits on behalf of the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> were filed against nine cities, including <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, charging violations of federal water pollution laws. In addition, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION> and two other cities agreed to pay fines totaling $ 349,000 as part of separate consent agreements involving past violations that stemmed from the illegal discharges, <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> officials said. The cases announced today involved lawsuits filed this week _ four of them today _ in federal courts in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>. The new actions brought to 61 cities in 21 states against which either administrative penalties have been sought or civil suits were filed this year because of improper releases of toxic industrial wastes. So far, the cities have agreed to pay more than $ 2.1 million in fines. The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> is seeking another $ 1.9 million in penalties in the two dozen cases that remain open, a figure that could increase once proposed penalties are included from the latest round of lawsuits. Nearly two-thirds of the 61 cases were initiated during the past two months. In some cases the actions were taken by the states involved after violations surfaced during EPA inspections of records, officials said. In the largest case, the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> and <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> reached a settlement in August in which city officials agreed to pay more than $ 1.1 million in penalties for alleged violations of clean water laws in connection with toxic discharges through the municipal sewage treatment plant. `` These lawsuits and penalties ... are designed to send a message to city and county officials,'' said <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> Administrator <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON>. Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said the lawsuits reflect the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration's `` determination not to sit idly by while our waters continue to be befouled.'' `` We simply can not allow harmful pollutants to reach our rivers and streams untreated. ... Local officials have a legal and moral responsibility to those they represent and to other users of our nation's waterways to make sure local industries abide by the rules,'' <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said. The federal lawsuits and <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> administrative enforcement actions allege that the cities failed to adequately identify the industrial discharges, allowed discharges in some cases without proper permits, did n't screen samples of the wastewater to determine if industrial plants were in compliance, and failed to take action against polluters violating the pre-treatment requirements. The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> said more than 870 million pounds of toxic industrial chemicals _ including cyanide, arsenic and hazardous heavy metals such as cadmium and lead _ were dumped into public sewage treatment plants in 1987, the latest year for which figures are available. These wastes combine with normal sewage and after treatment are released into open waters. But the treatment for normal sewage is n't enough for the toxic wastes, so federal law requires that if such chemical wastes are to be released through the sewage system they must first undergo pre-treatment at the industrial plant. But according to <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> estimates, as many as one-third of the 1,500 municipal sewage treatment facilities do n't adequately monitor such pre-treatment or take action against violators to ensure that the toxic wastes undergo treatment before entering the sewage system. Civil lawsuits were filed this week against <LOCATION> Gloucester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>.; <LOCATION> Dunkirk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Easton </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Punxsutawney </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Beaumont </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>; and <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> said consent agreements for past violations also were reached this week with <LOCATION> Nacogdoches </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, $ 60,000 fine; <LOCATION> Bellefonte </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, $ 64,000 fine; and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>, $ 225,000 fine.

 Negotiators broke a five-month deadlock and agreed on a tentative contract early today, averting a strike by 43,000 workers at more than 60 not-for-profit hospitals and nursing homes in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> area. Representatives of Local 1199 of the Drug, <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Care </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employees </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> said they expected the rank and file to ratify the three-year contract Thursday. The union represents some of the lowest-paid workers in the health industry _ nurses' aides, laboratory technicians, X-ray technicians, orderlies, clerks and social workers. Weekly wages are generally $ 300 to $ 400. The contract would grant raises of 7.5 percent the first and second years and 5 percent plus a $ 500 bonus the third year, said <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON>, union president. Employees also won a 3 percent boost in medical benefits, he said. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Abelow </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Voluntary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospitals </ORGANIZATION>, called the contract `` generous, expensive and fair.'' He said the health-care institutions in the group will have to `` scrape up, ask for and insist on more money'' from the state and insurance companies to pay the raises. A deadlock reached in May was cracked 75 minutes before the 5 a.m. strike deadline when federal mediator <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Flores </PERSON> persuaded <PERSON> Rivera </PERSON> and <PERSON> Abelow </PERSON> to meet. The two sides agreed to stop the clock and keep talking. Both sides said the key to the settlement was allowing the suspension of employer payments to an overfunded pension fund.

<TEXT>
 Lebanese legislators agreed to create a Parliament with an equal number of Moslems and Christians but remained split today over other aspects of a new government for their war-torn land. Conference sources said the political system that had given the Christians, especially Maronite Catholics, most government posts continued to be the focus today of the closed-door talks among 63 deputies. The legislators, under the auspices of the <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>, have been discussing since Saturday a proposed blueprint for a unified government, one that would give Moslems an equal say. The old covenant, in force since independence from <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> in 1943, gave greater power to Christians. It gave the premier's post to the Sunni Moslems and the Parliament speakership to the Shiite Moslems. Maronites, then the majority of the population, held the presidency and dominated the government, army, <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> and judiciary. Moslems now make up 55 percent of the population of 4 million. Under the proposed new system, jobs will be filled on `` merit,'' rather than sectarian basis. The Parliamentarians agreed on Tuesday to expand the 99-member Parliament to ensure equal distribution of seats between Christians and Moslems. Initially, an Arab League committee charged with mediating a settlement in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> had proposed that the number be increased to 128. But the conference sources, insisting on anonymity, said the parliamentarians agreed Tuesday to add only nine more seats to the present chamber, giving them all to the Moslems to make them equal to the Christians. However, no agreement was reported in the debate over presidential powers, which Moslems want curtailed to give the Moslem premiers and house speakers a wider role in the decision-making process. The <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> committee is made up of officials from <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Algeria </LOCATION>. Saudi Foreign Minister Prince <PERSON> Saud </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Faisal </PERSON> has attended the sessions, often intervening to defuse heated arguments. `` To abolish political factionalism is easier said than done,'' one deputy said, requesting anonymity. `` It indeed is an issue too explosive for the parliamentarians to handle without prior consent of the warlords,'' whose militias control the streets of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> after government authority has been eroded by 14 years of civil war. Two of these militia chiefs, <PERSON> Walid </PERSON> <PERSON> Jumblatt </PERSON>, a Druse, and <PERSON> Nabih </PERSON> <PERSON> Berri </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION>, flew to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> this week where they criticized the Taif meetings, indicating they would not endorse any accord. `` The deputies may well agree on a new formula, but the test of implementation will certainly prove more difficult. The Maronites are not going to go down willingly,'' he said, alluding to the Lebanese Forces coalition of right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> militias. The Lebanese Forces have not openly vetoed the reforms demanded by Moslems as the basis for a settlement of the civil war. But they support the Christian army commander, Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, who opposes completing any political reforms until Syrian agrees to a timetable for withdrawing its troops in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION> has 40,000 soldiers in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> under an <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping mandate, but <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> says it has lost its credibility because it fought alongside Moslems in the civil war. <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON> and the Syrians fought bloody artillery duels for six months before a cease-fire mediated by an Arab League committee on <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> took hold 11 days ago. The 14-year conflict has killed 150,000 people. The Parliament meetings in <LOCATION> Taif </LOCATION> were not expected to produce a final charter, but a blueprint to be ratified in a session in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> tentatively scheduled for Oct. 21.

 Soviet arms experts could visit <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> laboratories doing research on space-based missile defenses before the end of the year, an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> official said today. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON>, chief <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> negotiator on defense and space at the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> arms talks, urged <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to agree to regular annual exchanges of visits to such labs as a confidence-building measure. He said he believed the Soviets would accept an invitation to tour two <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sites, made by Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> when <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> met with Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> last month. Arrangements could be set during the current round of superpower arms talks, <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> said in an interview with the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> mission's daily bulletin The round is expected to end by early December. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> invitation covers equipment being developed at the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alamos </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and a commercial testing plant in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Capistrano </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>. Both are involved in high-tech research for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Strategic Defense Invitiative, or Star Wars, a project launched by former President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to provide space defenses against incoming ballistic missiles. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> has complained about the two facilities in the past, and visits would show `` that we are serious about opening our laboratories and increasing predictability about ballistic missiles defense capabilities,'' <PERSON> Cooper </PERSON> said. Early research, which can be monitored only on-the-spot, `` provides the greatest insight into where the sides are going,'' he said. In the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> talks, the Soviets have already agreed to annual exchanges of data on both sides' research into space-based missiles defenses, he said. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> offer to open SDI to Soviet experts was one of several arms control moves at the ministerial meeting, where <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> announced that <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> would no longer let its objections to SDI block the eventual signing of a treaty cutting long-nuclear forces.

A spokesman for the local <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> branch, which is <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s de facto embassy in the colony, said <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> had set a bad precedent in its handling of the case and had harmed cooperation between the governments. <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> <PERSON> Yang </PERSON>, 20, the No. 2 swimmer in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, left <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> for <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> Tuesday after being released from a detention center under a discretionary section of the immigration code. He was arrested Sept. 23 for having an expired visa. The swimmer earlier had sought political asylum in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, saying he feared <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> authorities would jail him for participating in pro-democracy marches in this British colony, but the asylum request was denied. `` This has not only marred cooperation between the two sides in this respect but will for sure adversely affect the normal contacts between the residents of the mainland and <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>,'' the unidentified <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said in remarks issued by the news agency. Hundreds of thousands of <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> residents visit <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> each year, with border crossings particularly heavy during the traditional Chinese holidays. The agency, in paraphrasing the spokesman, said the case `` will also cast its shadow over the cooperation between the two sides in other fields. Only the <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> government should be responsible for all the consequences.'' A week earlier, <ORGANIZATION> Xinhua </ORGANIZATION> issued a statement saying Chinese who participated in pro-democracy activities in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> would not face reprisals after returning to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. The incident comes at a particularly sensitive time for <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>, which reverts to Chinese sovereignty in 1997. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has promised the territory can retain its capitalist system for 50 years and enjoy a `` high degree of autonomy.'' But confidence in the territory's future suffered a serious setback when the Chinese army suppressed the pro-democracy movement in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. Tension between <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> and British governments tends to exacerbate the problem. Local media reported that <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> was granted a non-immigrant visa giving him permission to stay in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for six months. He could later travel to <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>, where he has been offered refuge as part of the Nationalist government's plan to grant residence to Chinese who played important roles in the pro-democracy movement in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> or elsewhere. The pro-Beijing New Evening Post today reported that <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> said after arriving in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> that he would not seek political asylum in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and that he does not know whether he will go to another country.

<HEAD>Only Two Guns Formally Rejected For Sale in Maryland</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ANNAPOLIS, Md. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A state panel set up last year under a first-in-the-nation gun control law aimed at ridding <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> of Saturday Night specials has banned only two weapons and approved 627. An additional 34 pistols, including several small, two-shot Derringers, have been tentatively rejected for sale or manufacture in <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> by the Handgun Roster Board. The approved list includes a semi-automatic <PERSON> Uzi </PERSON> pistol from <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Glock </ORGANIZATION> 17 from <LOCATION> Austria </LOCATION> that has some plastic parts that do n't show up on airport X-rays. Among other weapons approved are all handguns made by major manufacturers such as Colt and <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Wesson </ORGANIZATION>, as well as handguns approved for importation by the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alcohol </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Firearms </ORGANIZATION>. `` The people who were advocates of the law may be disappointed that more guns were n't excluded from the list,'' said <PERSON> Simon </PERSON> <PERSON> Atlas </PERSON>, a member of the board. `` But that's the way the law is written. Certainly, the worst fears the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rifle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> had have been laid to rest.'' The <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> vigorously opposed the law last year when it was before the Legislature. Among those who campaigned for the law were <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, wife of presidential press secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, who was shot and wounded along with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in 1981. The law makes it illegal beginning in 1990 to sell or manufacture handguns in <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> not approved by the nine-member board of gubernatorial appointees. Guns made prior to 1985 are excluded from the ban. Under law, the panel must consider nine criteria in weighing a particular weapon, including concealibility, accuracy and quality, to weed out Saturday Night specials _ the small, cheap, low-caliber handguns often used in street crimes. <PERSON> Sanford </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Maryland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Licensed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Firearms </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dealers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said the criteria used by the board are inexact, but he added, `` I think they're doing a good as job as can be expected under the circumstances.'' The only two weapons formally banned are .25 - caliber and .32 - caliber guns made <ORGANIZATION> Seecamp </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Haven </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn </LOCATION>. The company no longer makes the .25 - caliber The .32 - caliber gun, only 4 -LRB- inches long, was not considered safe enough to meet the requirements of the handgun <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Seecamp </PERSON>, owner of the company, called the board's action ridiculous He said the guns cost about $ 350, are well-made and are favored by women because they are light. The company also sells to judges, he said. Board member <PERSON> Matthew </PERSON> <PERSON> Fenton </PERSON>, who was shot with a handgun several years ago, said he tried unsuccessfully to persuade the board to ban some handguns with `` assault-type features,'' such as the Uzi 9mm semi-automatic. `` I asked why could n't we just allow those for law enforcement agencies?'' <PERSON> Fenton </PERSON> said.

 Former <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Maynard </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> recaptured the job he reluctantly left eight years ago, while a <ORGANIZATION> Mississippi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrat </ORGANIZATION> won a spot in a runoff for the state's only <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> seat in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> House. In <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>, voters took the first steps Tuesday toward replacing popular Mayor <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Voinovich </PERSON>, who is stepping aside to seek the Republican nomination for governor. The city council president and a state senator took the top two places in a mayoral primary, boosting them into the Nov. 7 general election. Phoenix re-elected its incumbent Democratic Mayor <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Goddard </PERSON> but rejected the downtown baseball stadium he wanted. And <LOCATION> Albuquerque </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.M. </LOCATION>, Mayor <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Schultz </PERSON> lost his bid to become the first mayor to be elected to back-to-back terms since the city switched to a mayor-council form of government 15 years ago. In <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> overwhelmed City Councilman <PERSON> Hosea </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> and four little-known candidates to recapture the job he relinquished to <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> in 1982. The law prohibited both men from seeking a third consecutive term, and <PERSON> Young </PERSON> is weighing a race for governor next year. `` Tonight, <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> has given me a mandate. A mandate to fulfill the promise of our great city,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> told about 2,500 cheering supporters. `` The future of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> began tonight. A city whose heart is stronger and whose mind is sharper begins tonight.'' In final, unofficial returns, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> had 54,897 votes or 79 percent. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> received 11,1116 votes or 16.5 percent. Four other candidates shared 4.5 percent of the vote. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, 51, said his new term would be different from his previous eight-year hitch. `` Some issues will be tougher,'' he said. However, he noted with pleasure that his margin of victory was the largest he'd received in five tries for election in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, where Democrats want to capture a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> seat that has been Republican for nearly 17 years, Republican <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> muscled his way into an Oct. 17 runoff with Democratic state Sen. <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>. The winner will succeed Rep. <PERSON> Larkin </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, who died in a plane crash Aug. 13. State Attorney General <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON>, a Democrat and the most familiar name in the race, was left behind. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> came in third and lost even his home county where he served as district attorney for 12 years. Complete but unofficial returns showed <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> with 51,383 votes or 42 percent, to 45,623 or 37 percent for <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, a longtime aide to Sen. <PERSON> Trent </PERSON> <PERSON> Lott </PERSON>, R-Miss. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> received 25,497 or 21 percent. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> received strong support from <PERSON> Lott </PERSON>, while <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> had the advantage of having run a strong race against <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> last year. <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> was criticized during the campaign for wanting to abandon the attorney general's job that he had won just 21 months before. City Council President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Forbes </PERSON> had been considered the frontrunner in <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>, and he proved the pollsters right by easily leading the field of five candidates. State Sen. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON> narrowly defeated Court Clerk <PERSON> Benny </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonanno </PERSON> to take the second runoff spot. Forbes received 46,493 votes or 37 percent, followed by White with 31,440 or 25 percent. <PERSON> Bonanno </PERSON> had 28,268 votes or 23 percent, <LOCATION> Cuyahoga </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Commissioner <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> Hagan </PERSON> had 11,799 votes or 9 percent and school board President <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> J </PERSON>. Perk Jr. had 5,891 votes or 5 percent. In <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Goddard </PERSON> won a fourth term, defeating state <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Burton </PERSON> <PERSON> Kruglick </PERSON> by a 2-1 margin, 89,386 votes to 46,277. Real estate broker <PERSON> Norris </PERSON> <PERSON> Inman </PERSON> was a distant third. But the stadium, which was intended to lure a baseball expansion team to <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>, lost 88,516 to 61,455. `` I do n't know what the message is,'' <PERSON> Goddard </PERSON> said. `` Obviously, that's one of the things we'll have to spend a lot of time trying to analyze.'' In <LOCATION> Albuquerque </LOCATION>, Democrats <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Saavedra </PERSON> and <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Baca </PERSON> will face each other in a runoff election for mayor after blocking <PERSON> Schultz </PERSON>'s re-election bid With all 156 precincts counted, <PERSON> Saavedra </PERSON>, the retired former president of the <ORGANIZATION> Albuquerque </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vocational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, led nine candidates with 25,584 votes, or 33 percent. <PERSON> Baca </PERSON>, a longtime member of <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> and retired educator, finished second but made the runoff with 18,044 votes, 23.2 percent. <PERSON> Schultz </PERSON> finished with 8,370 votes, for just 10.7 percent. In <LOCATION> Escondido </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, abortion rights advocate <PERSON> Tricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON> won a special election for a state Assembly seat, defeating her Democratic opponent and a fellow Republican who mounted a strong write-in campaign and opposes abortion.

<TEXT>
 Seven more killings were reported today in <LOCATION> Natal </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Province </LOCATION>, where the failure of peace talks between black factions has been accompanied by some of the worst bloodshed of a 3-year-old power struggle. The feud has claimed at least 15 lives so far this month, and monitoring groups say more than 95 people were killed last month, when negotiations between leaders of militant anti-apartheid groups and the more conservative Zulu political organization Inkatha reached an impasse. The anti-apartheid alliance, in a statement today, suggested that <LOCATION> Inkatha </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Mangotuthu </PERSON> <PERSON> Buthelezi </PERSON> has misused the peace process to seek political gain. The alliance also accused police of bias against its followers. More than 2,000 blacks have been killed since factional fighting began on a sustained basis in late 1986. The current peace initiative started in June, and the monthly death toll dropped by more than half, to about 40, as both sides issued positive statements. But Inkatha last month suspended its participation in the talks because it felt the other side remained hostile. Opposing Inkatha are supporters of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION>, a nationwide anti-apartheid coalition, and the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> African Trade Unions, the largest black labor federation. Both groups favor militant anti-government protest actions and endorse the political views of the outlawed <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> guerrilla movement. Inkatha, which claims 1.5 million members, rejects the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION>'s use of violence and opposes hard-line protest strategies such as boycotts, general strikes and economic sanctions. At a news conference, leaders of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Front </ORGANIZATION> and the labor federation suggested <PERSON> Buthelezi </PERSON> was more interested in enhancing his political position than in achieving peace. `` A peace process must be initiated with or without Inkatha,'' the two organizations said. `` We can not resolve the violence by continually stressing our differences and by attempting to politically embarrass each other.'' In preliminary talks, negotiators proposed a formal peace conference involving 10-member delegations from <LOCATION> Inkatha </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fron </ORGANIZATION> and the trade union congress. However, <ORGANIZATION> Inkatha </ORGANIZATION>'s leadership declared last month that there should only be two 10-member delegations, its own and one representing all the other groups. <PERSON> Inkatha </PERSON> also said it wants a personal reply from the <ORGANIZATION> ANC </ORGANIZATION> in response to a letter <PERSON> Buthelezi </PERSON> sent regarding arrangements for the talks. The unrest report issued today by police headquarters said six men and a woman were killed overnight in four separate incidents in <LOCATION> Mpumalanga </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>'s Halt in central <ORGANIZATION> Natal </ORGANIZATION>. Following standard police practice, no details were given about the affiliations of those involved. A clash involving roughly 800 men was reported in <LOCATION> Mpumalanga </LOCATION> on Monday, and several houses in the area have been burned down by attackers. Also today, an opposition political leader challenged the <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION> city council to follow the example of <LOCATION> Johannesburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> and other cities by ending segregation of public facilities. <PERSON> Tertius </PERSON> <PERSON> Spies </PERSON>, the regional leader of the anti-apartheid <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, said municipal buses, libraries, parks and swimming pools were off-limits to blacks in the nation's capital, despite claims by the governing <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> that apartheid was dead. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> controls <LOCATION> Pretoria </LOCATION>'s city council, which Spies said was `` dragging its heels.''

 The city has agreed to pay some 1,500 minority families up to $ 3,000 each to settle a housing discrimination suit filed by the <ORGANIZATION> NAACP </ORGANIZATION>. The approximately $ 3 million agreement was to be signed today in federal court, settling the lawsuit filed against the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Authority </ORGANIZATION> in 1988. Under the settlement, the largest group of people eligible for up to $ 2,500 each in damages comprises 1,058 families who say they applied for apartments in predominantly white housing projects in the <LOCATION> Charlestown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> neighborhoods over the last decade but were passed over for white applicants. `` We hope this sends a message to the institutions that discrimination costs,'' said <PERSON> Dianne </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilkerson </PERSON>, chairwoman of the housing committee of the <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> chapter of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> for the Advancement of Colored People. About 450 other families are eligible for damages of $ 1,000 to $ 3,000 each. Under the settlement, the city admitted no wrongdoing.

 A Lebanese hijacker lured into <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> custody was sentenced today to 30 years in federal prison for comandeering a <LOCATION> Jordanian </LOCATION> airliner in 1985 and holding its crew and passengers hostage for 30 hours. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Aubrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> sentenced <PERSON> Fawaz </PERSON> <PERSON> Younis </PERSON> to 30 years in prison for taking hostages, 20 years for aircraft piracy and five years for conspiracy. The sentences are to run concurrently. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> could have imposed a term of life imprisonment, but he noted that no one on the plane had been killed. He said, however, that a lengthy prison term is required because time `` will never wipe out what is in the minds'' of the passengers and crew subjected to the hijacking. <PERSON> Younis </PERSON>, who has spent the past two years in custody, could be eligible for parole in eight years, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Stephens </PERSON> said after the sentencing. <PERSON> Stephens </PERSON> said the term is `` fair'' and `` substantial'' and that it sends `` a clear message'' to people `` who would engage in acts of international terrorism.'' At his sentencing, the convicted hijacker asked the judge for leniency, saying he is not a terrorist and that he treated the two Americans aboard the airliner as `` friends.'' <PERSON> Younis </PERSON> was convicted March 14 of storming the Jordanian airliner in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> with four other gunmen and holding the 70 passengers and crew hostage for 30 hours. All aboard, including two Americans, were freed before the plane was blown up. In 1987, <PERSON> Younis </PERSON> was lured aboard a yacht in the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> on the pretext of a drug deal and grabbed by undercover <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have hailed the case as a strong signal that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will take whatever steps necessary to deal with terrorists. <PERSON> Younis </PERSON> was found innocent of threatening violence against passengers, destroying a civilian aircraft and carrying explosive devices aboard the plane. `` Why does the American government want to depict me as a terrorist, and believe that I am a threat to it?'' <PERSON> Younis </PERSON> asked in a letter to the judge last week. He said there is `` a huge difference between me, and those others'' involved in terrorism. <PERSON> Younis </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> movement, said he was instructed by his superiors to hijack an aircraft and fly it to <LOCATION> Tunis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION>, where a meeting of <ORGANIZATION> Arab </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> representatives was in progress. During the hijacking, he read a declaration demanding the league decide that one Arab nation allow all Palestinians to settle in the country and that Palestinians be removed from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. `` The thorny problem for this court is that Mr. <PERSON> Younis </PERSON> has previously stated and continues to believe that his actions were political in nature,'' his lawyer, <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, said in court papers. In a memo to the judge last week, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's office said <PERSON> Younis </PERSON> was one of the members of Amal who held <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> hostages in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> in connection with the hijacking of <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> Flight 847, days after the hijacking of the Jordanian airliner. In the <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> hijacking, <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> diver <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON> was murdered. <PERSON> Younis </PERSON> admitted he had been among the first to enter the <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> airliner when it landed at <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION>, said the government's sentencing memo <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION> terrorists, not the <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> movement, hijacked the <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> plane. The Amal, at the request of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government, worked to negotiate the release of the hostages, taking custody of some to prevent all the passengers and crew from falling into the hands of <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said. `` No one from the Amal movement was aboard the plane when ... <PERSON> Stethem </PERSON> was killed,'' <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 A <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> jet preparing for an emergency landing dumped 330 gallons of fuel over a suburb, spraying a group of children and new cars. The <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727 carrying 83 people returned safely to <LOCATION> O'Hare </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> on Tuesday after a faulty air duct activated a fire warning light on takeoff for <LOCATION> Salt </LOCATION> <LOCATION> lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, authorities said. No evidence of fire was found. <PERSON> Anne </PERSON> <PERSON> Tartol </PERSON>, a bicycle safety instructor, was teaching 32 8-year-olds in Mount Prospect when the jet passed overhead. `` I looked up. We felt a spray, like a mist. There was smoke around the plane. Our sunglasses filmed over. We smelled awful,'' she said. `` The kids started saying it was snowing.'' Mount Prospect Fire Department Lt. <PERSON> Art </PERSON> <PERSON> Felski </PERSON> said the exposure was probably only minimal and that there was little health risk for the children. Ordinarily, a jet making an emergency landing dumps it fuel over an uninhabited area or from a high enough altitude that evaporates before reaching the ground. A car dealership also reported being sprayed by the fuel. `` There's an oily film over all of the cars and trucks out here, about two-thirds of my inventory,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmerler </PERSON>, a Ford dealer. `` I called <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> and they said they had an emergency landing situation.

 Mexican President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON> told a joint meeting of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> today his country intends `` to eradicate drug trafficking at its very roots'' but he said the war against drugs globally is being lost. <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON>, who is here on a state visit, also stepped up his campaign for greater access for Mexican products to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> markets, descibing as an `` inequitable paradox'' the relative openness of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> to foreign imports compared with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. While pledging a continued all-out effort to curb drug smuggling, <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> ruled out joint U.S.-Mexican military operations to fight the traffickers. `` <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> intends to eradicate drug trafficking at its very roots in the sphere that falls under its responsibility,'' <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> said, speaking in Spanish while his listerners read from copies translated into English. `` This world fight is also our own,'' he said. He added that mutual finger pointing about who is to blame for continued drug use wastes time and effort that should be spent attacking the common enemy. <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> received a warm welcome from the assembled gathering when he entered the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> chamber, a reflection of the marked improvement in U.S.-Mexican relations since he assumed the presidency 10 months ago. But, consistent with most addresses by foreign leaders before joint meetings of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, only a small percentage of the 535 voting members actually were present. Most of the seats were filled by congressional pages. <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON>, who met on Tuesday with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, said there is a `` mature and responsible understanding'' of the links in the `` drug chain of terror.'' He added that there is greater acceptance in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> regarding the importance of giving greater emphasis to reducing demand for drugs. Previously, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> put much of its focus on reducing the supply through interdiction and other efforts. While stressing <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s willingness to cooperate, <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> said the struggle worldwide against drug use has suffered setbacks. `` When we see the magnitude of the fight against drugs, we must honestly ask ourselves: are we winning or losing the war? I think that, at the world level, we are losing and that is unacceptable.'' He said the solution lies in more cooperation among governments. On trade, <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> needs `` greater reciprocity'' to ensure that it will continue to be one of the most open economies in the world. `` Our country is practically free of -LRB- trade -RRB- barriers, but we continue confronting them in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> said. `` Let us resolve this inequitable paradox. We seek greater access to the textile and steel markets and the Generalized System of Preferences. We want a bilateral agreement that will break down trade barriers, sector by sector.'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have expressed irritation with <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON>' portrayal of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as a protectionist nation. They point out that two-thirds of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s exports come to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and that <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> had a $ 2.7 billion surplus in its <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade last year on total two-way trade of about $ 44 billion.

<TEXT>
 A skeptical <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> was urged today to overturn a <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> ordinance that imposes strict licensing requirements for sexually oriented businesses. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Weston </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, lawyer representing the businesses, said the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> city's ordinance imposes `` a prior restraint'' on free speech that violates the Constitution. Under the ordinance, `` one may not disseminate speech one has chosen to disseminate absent a permit,'' <PERSON> Weston </PERSON> said. The local law `` permits the city to do indirectly what it can not do directly,'' he said. `` We're not dealing with nuclear power plants,'' <PERSON> Weston </PERSON> added in arguing there is no lawful ground for such strict rules. But the justices repeatedly challenged <PERSON> Weston </PERSON>'s assertions. Chief Justice <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON>, addressing one of the lawyer's main arguments, said there is no precedent for giving special consideration to bookstores seeking licenses to do business. `` There is no -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- case close to suggesting that,'' <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON> said. Justice <PERSON> Antonin </PERSON> <PERSON> Scalia </PERSON>, in frequently barbed questioning, said to <PERSON> Weston </PERSON>, `` You mean that every bookstore can not be subject to normal business licensing?'' <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> City Attorney <PERSON> Analeslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Muncy </PERSON> said the ordinance is a vital weapon against crime and urban decay. The licensing rules are aimed at businesses that `` are 100 percent sexually oriented,'' she said. She added that nothing prevents the business owners from distributing their wares in other ways. `` They can sell the same material through the mails, door to door or on a street corner,'' she said. The justices are expected to announce a ruling by July, providing new guidelines on how far communities may go to limit sexually oriented businesses. The <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> ordinance is being challenged by owners of adult bookstores, motion picture theaters, nightclubs and motels. The law also applies to nude-model studios and sexual-encounter establishments. But no such businesses were represented in today's case The 1986 ordinance requires sexually oriented businesses to obtain a license issued by the city police chief. Such businesses must permit inspection of their premises during operating hours. No one convicted of a variety crimes, including promoting prostitution, may obtain a license. The ordinance also bars motel owners from renting rooms for less than 10 hours, a provision intended to discourage prostitution. Establishments offering sexually oriented entertainment must be open to surveillance by authorities without search warrants. The 5th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> upheld the local law. The appeals court said the city's campaign against urban blight, crime and declining property values provides `` compelling justification'' for the regulations. `` The city need only show that a -LRB- criminal -RRB- conviction and the evil to be regulated bear a substantial relationship'' to justify that aspect of the ordinance, the appeals court said. It also said that the discretion given the police chief to issue, suspend and revoke licenses is not impermissibly broad. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in 1986 upheld a <LOCATION> Renton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wash. </LOCATION>, ordinance restricting the location of adult theaters. The <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> ordinance also contains strict zoning rules. But the justices rejected a challenge to those provisions in the <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> law, leaving them intact. Several groups have joined the <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> business owners in attacking the ordinance. They include the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Booksellers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publishers </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> and the Freedom to <ORGANIZATION> Read </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>. Citizens for Decency Through Law and the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Family </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> lined up to support the <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> ordinance.

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> has upheld President <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Barco </PERSON>'s decree allowing extradition of accused drug bosses to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> but overturned his order to seize their ranches, mansions and other property. The government, meanwhile, was preparing to send another alleged drug trafficker to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The court met Tuesday to rule on constitutional aspects of decrees Barco issued as part of a 7-week-old crackdown on <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s drug cartels. The decisions by the 24-member <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> preserve <PERSON> Barco </PERSON>'s main weapon in his government's unprecedented crackdown on cocaine traffickers, who have used murder, bribery and intimidation to thwart Colombian efforts to bring them to justice But the court ruled that a <ORGANIZATION> Barco </ORGANIZATION> decree allowing property seizures did not specifically cite drug traffickers and threw it out on a technicality. However, <PERSON> Barco </PERSON> today made a statement saying he issued another decree a year ago that specifically did cite drug traffickers. The court now must rule on that decree. Meanwhile, military raids are expected to continued. The government already has seized 1,056 homes, ranches, mansions and other properties belonging to drug barons. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials say that because Colombian cocaine bosses are unable to intimidate <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> judges the traffickers fear extradition more than any other measure against them. Since 1981, about 50 Colombian judges have been killed in attacks blamed on the drug gangs. Traffickers of the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cocaine cartel said last month in a letter to <LOCATION> Barco </LOCATION> that they prefer a grave in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> to a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> jail. On Sept. 6, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> extradited <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, an economist thought to work for the <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> cartel. <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> was sent to <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> to face federal charges of laundering millions of cartel drug dollars. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Colombian authorities have begun extradition procedures against another drug suspect, <PERSON> Ana </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Tamayo </PERSON>, indicted in 1983 in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> on conspiracy and drug trafficking charges. Authorities last week notified <PERSON> Ana </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Tamayo </PERSON> that her extradition was pending, and her five-day appeal period expires Thursday. <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Tamayo </PERSON> was indicted in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> in 1983 on conspiracy and drug trafficking charges. The national radio chain <PERSON> Caracol </PERSON> said today that the government had taken final legal steps toward her extradition, making that possible at any time now. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> also wants extraditon of two other purported traffickers, <PERSON> Bernardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Pelaez </PERSON> <PERSON> Roldan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Bueno </PERSON> <PERSON> Delgado </PERSON>, recently captured by Colombian authorities. Tuesday's court ruling on the extraditions backs the Barco administration at a time when the conflict shows no signs of abating. Since Barco declared the crackdown hours after the assassination of a leading presidential candidate Aug. 18, authorities have blamed drug traffickers for at least 142 bombings. By ruling extradition constitutional, the court helped allay fears that the justice system would undermine <ORGANIZATION> Barco </ORGANIZATION>'s campaign. The court has a history of resisting <ORGANIZATION> Barco </ORGANIZATION>'s efforts to use state of siege powers to fight leftist guerrillas and drug traffickers. In 1984, the high court, ruling on a technicality, declared extraditions to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> unconstitutional. In apparently unrelated violence, a <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> source said leftist guerrillas kidnapped and killed a Catholic bishop in the northeastern state of <LOCATION> Arauca </LOCATION>. The source said the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> had kidnapped <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON> <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Emilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaramillo </PERSON> on Monday and that the church official's body was found Tuesday near the town of Arauquita on the border with <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>. The source, speaking on condition of anonymity, said there was no indication why the bishop may have been murdered. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> is headed by a defrocked priest, <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> source said the bishop was killed by another defrocked priest serving under <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>.

 Riot police fired tear gas today to disperse university students protesting the arrest of two student leaders. An estimated 4,000 students boycotted classes and many fought running battles with baton-wielding riot squads, a student spokesman said. Stones were thrown at police, and the windows of a limousine used by the <ORGANIZATION> Zimbabwe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> vice chancellor, Professor <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Kamba </PERSON>, were smashed by rioters, said the spokesman who requested anonymity. Sporadic clashes continued throughout the day, and the semi-official <ORGANIZATION> Zimbabwe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said more than 50 protesters were arrested. It was not clear whether students were injured. Deputy Police Commissioner <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Chingoka </PERSON> was quoted as saying that the unrest was `` very well under control.'' The news agency said university officials were scheduled to meet with President <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mugabe </PERSON> to discuss the student protests. In a leaflet distributed before the start of classes today, student leaders called for a meeting on campus to discuss the arrests today of student council members <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Mutambara </PERSON> and <PERSON> Enock </PERSON> <PERSON> Chikweche </PERSON>. The leaflet said police surrounded and stormed a campus residence and <PERSON> Mutambara </PERSON> was `` profusely bleeding'' after jumping from a second-floor window in an effort to escape from police who broke down the door of his bedroom. `` The notorious riot police have struck,'' said the leaflet. It described student action in response as `` a matter of life and death.'' Student leaders said they believed <PERSON> Mutambara </PERSON>'s arrest was prompted by a statement he issued Oct. 2 criticizing the government and university authorities. That statement said police banned a student meeting scheduled for Sept. 29 to mark the first anniversary of a student demonstration organized in 1988 to protest official corruption. In the past year, college students have staged several demonstrations in which they accused the government of stifling free expression and curbing academic freedoms. Education minister <PERSON> Fay </PERSON> <PERSON> Chung </PERSON> labeled students `` hooligans and drunkards'' and said they were being manipulated by political opponents to attack the government.

 Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> said today the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> reserves the right to use military force against <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> leader Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, and dismissed `` armchair generals'' who faulted the administration for failing to support Tuesday's failed coup with American troops. `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> retains the option to use American forces. That option has never been ruled out,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. `` But if you're going to risk American lives, it's the president's view that you do so on your own timetable. `` You do so based on your own plans. At a time of maximum opportunity and advantage. You do n't do so on the basis of someone else's plans and in response to rapidly changing circumstances,'' he said. At the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>, one official said various military options were discussed Tuesday with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as the coup unfolded. Another official said: `` When it appeared as though <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> might have been dethroned ... there were several options considered, none of which was going in and getting him.'' Both spoke on the condition of anonymity. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> deftly sidestepped whether the administration played any role in the failed coup attempt, but he implied that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had kept its distance because the rebels had little chance of ousting <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. A number of members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, including Sen. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Boren </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Okla </LOCATION>., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> criticized the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration after the short-lived coup for what they said was failure to support members of the special security unit that tried to take over <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s central command post `` It's easy to be an armchair general,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said, without informing the committee members whether the rebels had at least tacit assurances of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> support, as some reports have suggested. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> acted immediately to do two things _ to safeguard <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> lives and to assure the security of the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION>, just as the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is obligated to do under the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> treaties. The treaties call on the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to turn control of the American-built canal at the end of the century and to maintain the neutrality of the waterway. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops at the <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> said the situation today is calm but troops and civilians remained under a <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> advisory, which means they are to avoid unnecessary travel outside U.S.-controlled areas, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> said. Officials acknowledged Tuesday they had advance word of a coup attempt, but the president said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> did not engineer it. `` We had some indications this sort of thing was in the works,'' said <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, `` but until it happens, you never know.'' He characterized the prior information as `` rumblings.'' But <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> provided no details of the precise steps taken by the White House while events unfolded on Tuesday in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. He said they were breaking rapidly. `` It is easy after the fact in one of these situations to second-guess the events by arguing that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should have done something differently,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. He told the committee the administration considered <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s government `` an outlaw regime'' and would continue pressuring for him to give up power `` Our policy has been to apply relentless pressure on the <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> regime. Across the board _ diplomatically, economically and to defend American lives and <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> rights under our <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> treaties,'' he said. Some members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> could have provided military support to the rebel forces which tried to depose <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. The general is sought in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on drug trafficking charges. `` Once again we have snatched defeat from the jaws of victory, and I think it's an outrage,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>, ranking Republican on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Foreign Relations committee. <PERSON> Boren </PERSON> said Tuesday it was wrong for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, with its 12,000 military personnel in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, `` to stand by ... and do nothing, and allow these people to fail.'' But Vice President <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> had said, `` We're not going to be involved in any kind of a coup attempt in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' and this morning Sen. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Lugar </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>, a moderate Republican, dismissed the criticism. `` It's very easy to be an armchair general,'' he told <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>. The <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Times today quoted congressional sources as saying that in advance of Tuesday's attempt, American military officers in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> led the rebels to believe they would get <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military help. An unidentified senior administration official told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> that rebel leaders had passed word at least three times this week that an effort to topple <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was imminent. One official told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had agreed to tae custody of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> if the rebels captured him. Another official told the Times that before it became clear <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> had not been captured, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had asked to have him turned over and the rebels refused. `` I want to see democracy in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> succeed,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> insisted after it became apparent Tuesday that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> had squashed the coup. `` Am I disappointed that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is still there? Yes I am,'' he said later. `` Nothing's changed. Everything remains the same. We'll continue to press for <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s removal'' and his arrest to stand trial in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> turned aside further questions Tuesday night at a state dinner for visiting Mexican President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON>. But <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said, `` I ` m not sure what we could have done'' to help the anti-Noriega forces. `` This is a situation that is going to be handled within <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. We're not going to be involved in any kind of a coup attempt in <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> ... This is <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s problem. Earlier Tuesday <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> gave verbal support to the still-battling coup leaders in comments to reporters. He said the administration has `` no argument'' with <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s Panamanian <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION>, only with the dictator himself. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has made similar comments over the past several months, in what some saw as barely disguised goading for the PDF to mount a coup. Saying he hoped his words would be `` conveyed instantly'' to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, the president said, `` Our argument has been ... with Mr. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> who aborted the democratic will of the people of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>,'' a reference to <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s invalidation of last May's election that observers said was overwhelmingly won by his opposition. `` There were rumors around that this was some American operation and I can tell you that is not true,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told reporters at an Oval Office photo session. `` We did not take any action that would have constituted direct involvement,'' said <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>, adding that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> helicopters observed the fighting and troops were stationed `` around one of the causeways there to protect access and rights and so forth.''

<HEAD>Calls for Multiparty System in Yugoslavia</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Premier Ante <PERSON> Markovic </PERSON> called for a multiparty system as a solution for the country's growing economic and political problems and charged that conservative Communists are blocking his reforms. `` The logic of pluralistic ownership, which demands a system of its own, will have to demand and open the society to a multiparty system,'' he said in a television interview Tuesday night. <PERSON> Markovic </PERSON>'s statement challenged a <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> ruling that allows existence of multiple parties only under the the <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION>, a Communist-dominated umbrella group. Despite growing calls for change, the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> has so far blocked the multiparty systems gradually being embraced by <ORGANIZATION> Warsaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pact </ORGANIZATION> allies <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Markovic </PERSON>, however, said that the `` new socialism'' he has sought to introduce as part of his market-oriented economic reforms is meeting with growing resistance of the Communists. He said that opponents to his economic reforms expressed concern that state property would become `` threatened'' by the planned economic liberalization. `` I expect now an intensification of the conflict between ideology and -LRB- reforms -RRB-,'' <PERSON> Markovic </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s annual inflation rate hit an all-time record of nearly 1,200 percent, mostly due to sharp increases in the prices of vital staples and services, such as electricity, meat and bread. Officials in the country's largest republic, <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION>, have said they will demand <PERSON> Markovic </PERSON>'s resignation if his program does not quickly curb the rampant inflation. In a speech when he became premier in March, <PERSON> Markovic </PERSON> called an open-market economy `` an ultimate achievement of mankind for which no alternative has yet been found.'' He demanded urgent introduction of stocks and bonds, private initiative and entrepreneurship in the Yugoslav economy and an end to state interference in the running of businesses. Other segments of the radical market-oriented economic reforms underlined by <PERSON> Markovic </PERSON> would include the reshaping of the banking system along Western lines, creation of a capital market, and an end to state subsidies for loss-making enterprises. In addition to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s highest inflation rate <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> is burdened by a $ 19 billion foreign debt, a 17 percent unemployment rate and growing labor and ethnic unrest. <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> consists of six republics and two autonomous provinces, each with its own government and party structure. <LOCATION> Serbia </LOCATION> is dominated by hard-line Communists. The decentralized system of government and collective federal presidency were devised in 1974 Constitution to prevent one republic from gaining sway over the others, but it has resulted in an ineffective government by compromise. In <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>, the federal government is generally responsible for economic policy while the collective presidency, which appoints the premier, dictates defense and foreign policy. But the bulk of political influence in the country is concentrated in the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, with power dispersed in eight often fractious central committees reflecting the administrative division of the country.

<TEXT>
 An evenly divided <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> refused early today to reduce the tax on capital gains, voting instead to liberalize <ORGANIZATION> Individual </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Retirement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounts </ORGANIZATION> in an effort to encourage saving. The 10-10 vote was split nearly along party lines, but both sides agreed the battle will be fought again on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor, perhaps later this week. The vote came on an amendment by Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Packwood </PERSON>, R-Ore., to substitute a capital gains cut for the expanded IRAs that Chairman <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, had written into the bill The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration supports <PERSON> Packwood </PERSON>'s plan. The tie vote retained <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s plan to liberalize IRAs. Each side argued that the other's plan was more beneficial to those with higher incomes, but there was little of the emotional debate that marked <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> passage of a different capital gains cut and rejection of the same <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> proposal a week earlier. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> today prodded the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> to follow the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>'s example and sharply reduce the capital gains tax The House version would cut the tax on capital gains, now 28 to 33 percent, to 19.6 percent for two years, then index it to inflation. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, addressing a group of minority small business people, said, `` This is a tax cut for all, a way to channel investment back into new growth and new jobs. ... It is a job-oriented tax cut.'' The vote against the capital gains cut came as the committee completed work on a bill whose chief purpose is to reduce the 1990 federal budget deficit by about $ 8 billion. The bill was approved on a voice vote early today. Most of the deficit reduction would come from a package of relatively minor revenue increases, including permanent extension of the 3 percent tax on local and long distance telephone service. The biggest single money-raiser in the bill is a $ 3.6 billion reduction in government Medicare reimbursements for doctors and hospitals. The remainder would come from a potpourri of relatively minor tax changes, mostly affecting corporations. Numerous provisions that have no relation to deficit reduction were tacked onto the bill. One of the biggest was a $ 1-billion-a-year saving for Social Security recipients between the ages of 65 and 69 who continue to work past the traditional retirement age. With all nine Republicans and Democrat <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Boren </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> in opposition, the committee voted to allow all workers to take a tax deduction for half an <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> contribution of up to $ 2,000 a year. Most of the tax saving on that change would go to workers making more than $ 50,000 a year, since those below that income level already are permitted fully or partially deductible accounts. Workers at all income levels would be allowed to take penalty-free withdrawals from their IRAs to make the down payment on a first home or to pay for a college education. Under <PERSON> Packwood </PERSON>'s amendment, the longer a share of stock, land or other investment was owned, the less its profits would be taxed when sold. For example, 95 percent of the profit would be taxed if sold after one year; after six years, 70 percent would be taxed. The legislation includes several miscellaneous tax cut provisions, in addition to expanded IRAs, that have nothing to do with reducing the budget deficit. Those include new assistance for rural hospitals and extension of several expiring tax breaks, including those for employer-paid education assistance; first-time homebuyers and corporations that increase spending for research. It would increase to $ 14,500 a year the amount that people between the ages of 65 and 69 may earn without losing any of their Social Security benefits. The `` earnings limitation'' this year is $ 8,880; for each $ 3 earned above that level, the beneficiary loses $ 1 of Social Security. The bill would repeal a scheduled decline in the 8 percent airline passenger ticket tax; the completed-contract method of accounting that permits big builders and defense contractors to defer taxes; and a lucrative tax benefit for some corporations that borrow to fund an employee stock-ownership plan.

 Six police officers have been indicted on civil rights charges in the December beating death of a suspected drug dealer who allegedly had put out a murder contract on one of them. A federal grand jury Tuesday indicted the six members of the <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> police force's elite street narcotics unit. They face a maximum of life in prison if convicted. Four of the officers were arrested and the others had surrendered by early today. <PERSON> Leonardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Mercado </PERSON>, 35, a small-time crack dealer, died Dec. 16 after police received an anonymous tip that he had put out a contract on Officer <PERSON> Pablo </PERSON> <PERSON> Camacho </PERSON>. <PERSON> Mercado </PERSON> was beaten at a relative's house. Witnesses said the officers took Mercado inside the home, shut the door and pulled a curtain closed. Rescue workers took him to a hospital, where he died a short time later. <PERSON> Camacho </PERSON> and Officers <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Haynes </PERSON>, <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinclair </PERSON>, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Trujillo </PERSON>, <PERSON> Nathaniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Veal </PERSON> and <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Watson </PERSON> were each charged with four civil rights violations, said <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> Cossin </PERSON>, executive assistant to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Dexter </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehtinen </PERSON>. The six were relieved of their duties soon after the death. The Police Department was rocked earlier in the decade by charges that 15 officers stole drugs from smugglers and resold them. The 15 were blamed for the drownings of three drug boat guards, who leaped into the <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> in a 1985 raid.

 Here are excerpts from recent editorials in newspapers throughout the country: Oct. 2 <ORGANIZATION> Argus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Leader </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Sioux </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.D. </LOCATION>, on chemical weapons: If hypocrisy was an international crime, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would be guilty. On one hand, the nation is building a stockpile of chemical weapons. On the other, it condemns countries such as <LOCATION> Libya </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> for producing chemical arms. Intellectual conflicts like that aside, the world's superpowers and other nations finally seem positioned to make major progress toward a ban on chemical weapons. Encouragingly, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s condemnation of such weapons last week before the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> was well received. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> offered to cut <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> stocks of chemical weapons by more than 80 percent if the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> would do the same. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, in turn, said it would radically reduce or completely destory its chemical weapons, halt nuclear tests and stop making weapons-grade plutonium and uranium if the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would do the same. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposal would require that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> make deeper cuts than the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, because the Soviets have more chemical weapons. That might be a stumbling block toward further progress. So will the very breadth of the Soviet proposal, which also would affect nuclear weapons. But some of the biggest obstacles had to be overcome just to get this far. Continued progress is welcome, whether it is wrapped in hypocrisy or not.

 Oct. 1 The Providence -LRB- <LOCATION> R.I. </LOCATION> -RRB- Sunday Journal on the capital gains tax: In retrospect, it is hardly surprising that President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s capital gains tax cut should win so handily in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION> last week Politicians can scarcely resist voting for a plan to get something for nothing, and despite all the rhetoric to the contrary, that is just what this tax cut offered. ... The `` rich'' that -LRB- Majority Leader <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> -RRB- <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> insists will be the only beneficiaries of a capital gains tax cut include low - and middle-income earners who would benefit only after cashing in their investments ... Many of these same people voted for <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> last November, and -LRB- the -RRB- unexpectedly lopsided vote on capital gains may indicate that their interests are being recognized by a growing number of legislators. This trend, if it spreads to related tax and budget issues, could provide the president with a working majority in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, similar to the one forged by <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in 1981. We believe the economic policies that would emerge from <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> under those circumstances would be good for the country.

 Sept. 27 The Record, <LOCATION> Hackensack </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, on the lack of AZT for children: Hundreds of kids are suffering and dying because they are unable to obtain azidothymidine, the most effective treatment against AIDS. <ORGANIZATION> Burroughs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wellcome </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, the manufacturer, says it's moving as fast as it can to make AZT available to kids. But the assurance rings hollow since the company has yet to apply for government approval to market the drug to children under 12. Critics say the company is dragging its feet because the potential market among children is small. Until the drug receives <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> approval for the children, the insurance companies and the federal government will not pick up its cost ... about $ 6,000 a year _ which many parents can not afford. In addition, the adult formulation of AZT is too strong for children. The capsules must be broken and smaller amounts of the foul-tasting medicine mixed with juice or another liquid. The situation is absurd. The company should file an application as soon as possible and develop a dosage that is appropriate for childern. AIDS does n't discriminate against children.

So, would someone do our fearless leaders a favor and send a gallon or two of anti-itch oil? In recent months, a majority of senators and representatives in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> have supported legislation to change the basic designs of all of our coins. As one advocate put it, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> believes that Americans want new coins that are n't so `` fixed in the past.'' <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> would have us remove the `` old baldie,'' the American eagle.

It's hard to understand why <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, so laden down with real money problems, must go out of its way to correct perceived money problems.

 The Cabinet on Wednesday backed the ban on burying <PERSON> Ferdinand </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> in the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> after the defense chief reportedly warned legislators of threats against the government. Also Wednesday, a government agency said it might help the former president's widow, <PERSON> Imelda </PERSON>, with her legal problems if she returns some assets acquired with money allegedly embezzled by <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> during his rule. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>, 72, died in <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> on Thursday. He had lived in exile in <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION> since he was ousted in a military-civilian uprising that catapulted <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> to power in February 1986. Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> has refused to allow the body to be brought back here for burial, citing possible civil unrest. Economic Planning Secretary <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Estanislao </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramos </PERSON> told Cabinet members the country faced a number of security risks if <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' body were returned. `` There are destabilization threats,'' <PERSON> Estanislao </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. `` He -LRB- <PERSON> Ramos </PERSON> -RRB- presented intelligence reports including the possible assassination of the president.'' <PERSON> Ramos </PERSON> refused to confirm or deny <PERSON> Estanislao </PERSON>'s disclosure, saying the briefing was `` highly classified.'' <PERSON> Ramos </PERSON> said his department has been constantly receiving reports about possible attempts against the government. He said the 20-year-old Communist insurgency remains the most serious threat. <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' followers have been linked to several of the six armed attempts to topple Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>. But since <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' death, demonstrations by his followers have been relatively small and peaceful. On Tuesday, the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> agreed to consider a petition from <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON>' supporters to allow <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> to be buried in his homeland and to allow his widow and three children to attend. They also are barred from entering the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>. In a speech Wednesday, Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> repeated her concerns about allowing the <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> family in. `` I know the threat that this man poses to the country I am sworn to protect, yet I know the loneliness of exile and the pain of being struck by death without setting foot on one's native soil,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Imelda </PERSON> <PERSON> Marcos </PERSON> has been banned from leaving the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> pending her trial in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> in March on charges of embezzling <LOCATION> Philippine </LOCATION> government money and investing some of it in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Two Leading Opposition Members Jail in Abortion Case</HEAD>
<DATELINE>RANGOON, Burma (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Two leading members of <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s opposition movement were ordered jailed for three years for allegedly sheltering a man whose girlfriend had an illegal abortion, official media reported Wednesday. The Working People's Daily said the opposition leaders, Win Tin and <PERSON> Ngwe </PERSON> <PERSON> Hlaing </PERSON>, of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION>, were accused of sheltering 22-year-old <PERSON> Soe </PERSON> <PERSON> Thein </PERSON>. Soe, his girlfriend and two doctors who performed the abortion have since been sentenced to 10 years in jail, the newspaper said. It said <PERSON> Soe </PERSON> and his girlfriend are members of the youth wing of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION>, the most popular opposition group to emerge from a pro-democracy uprising last year. Win Tin was a member of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>'s nine-man central executive committee, and <PERSON> Ngwe </PERSON> <PERSON> Hlaing </PERSON> was an organizer for the group in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>. They were arrested July 4. `` It is in keeping with the line that none are ever persecuted for their political activities _ only for breaking the law in some way _ that they have chosen to come down extremely savagely on an alleged abortion,'' said a Rangoon-based Western diplomat in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>. He spoke on condition of anonymity. Abortion is illegal in <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>, but prosecution has been rare. In July, the military government began a general clampdown on the National League and other active opposition groups. On July 20, <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> San </PERSON> <PERSON> Suu </PERSON> <PERSON> Kyi </PERSON>, the general secretary of the league, and its chairman, Tin Oo, were put under house arrest on charges of subversion. Since then, Western diplomats say several thousand other activists have been detained.

 About 130 East Germans, some telling desperate stories about swimming rivers and evading border police, arrived at the West German embassy Wednesday seeking refuge and passage to the West. The newcomers brought to about 400 the number of people waiting in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> for word on their bid to reach <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. A West German diplomat urged the refugees to be calm and not to fear giving accurate information as they were registered, even though some had crossed the border illegally. West German Foreign Minister <PERSON> Hans-Dietrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> said in a radio interview that he expected <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> `` to keep its word not to send any refugees back to the GDR -LRB- <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> -RRB- against their will.'' An <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said there were `` mass scale'' attempts by East Germans to enter <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> illegally and that border guards had turned back some East Germans before they reached <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. There have been no confirmed reports of East Germans being handed back over to <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> once they are on Polish soil. Many East Germans said they headed for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> after learning the border to <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> had been closed. However, East Germans need permits from their government to travel to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, and several said these were now unavailable. <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> said he expected a solution would be found for the refugees in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, although none was announced when permission was given Tuesday night for about 11,000 East Germans to leave <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>. When the two Germanys reached their first agreement about refugees, about 800 left <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> for <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> by train early Sunday, following thousands of others from <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>. Among those waiting for a second solution to the crisis are some who missed the weekend release by minutes. One father said that as his family drove up Sunday to learn they were too late, `` We panicked. We did n't know what would be.'' `` But we were sure we would n't go back,'' he said. `` And then it turned out we were not alone.'' Wednesday's arrivals huddled outside a kiosk near the West German Embassy in a residential section of <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>, filling out forms and waiting for buses to transport them to hotels 24 miles from the capital. Some trembled in clothing wet from their overnight swim across the Neisse and <PERSON> Oder </PERSON> rivers that form the border. An embassy official brought a carload of blankets. Reports circulated of soldiers massing at the border, and some refugees told of hiding from guards. Some said Polish border guards had chased refugees. Earlier groups of East Germans had said Polish authorities appeared to make little effort to stop the crossings. Col. <PERSON> Andrzej </PERSON> <PERSON> Sadlinski </PERSON>, the spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, confirmed that many East Germans had tried to cross the border illegally. He said <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> was obligated to prevent such crossings.

 Sept. 28 Statesman-Journal, <LOCATION> Salem </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, on Dr. <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>: It does n't take a sharp legal mind to figure out that something went wrong with our justice system when a mother who would n't tell the court where her daughter is must spend more time in jail than drug dealers and rapists. Dr. <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON>, -LRB- arguing that her ex-husband sexually abused her 7-year old daughter -RRB-, refused to produce <PERSON> Hilary </PERSON> for court-ordered visits. <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> -LRB- spent -RRB- 759 days in jail for contempt of court. It took a public outcry and an act of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to free her. But the case is n't finished, and she could be jailed again for continuing to defy the court. ... The law that tries to force a person to obey legitimate legal orders, especially when it involves a youngster, is sound. It's the procedure and the judge's interpretation that are out of whack. ... Custodial interference cases of this sort demand a different kind of justice and punishment. And now that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has seen the injustice of sentencing <PERSON> Morgan </PERSON> to an indeterminate sentence ... without a trial or a conviction, maybe it will change the laws on contempt of court.

It was a happening. Two weeks ago, when the <ORGANIZATION> Santa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barbara </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alcoholism </ORGANIZATION> and Drug Abuse invited 7,500 parents to attend a presentation intended to help them keep their children in school and out of the clutches of chemical dependency, organizers were justifiably stunned and bewildered when only 30 people attended. For them it was a poignant moment _ a stark realization that this essential ingredient in the formula for educational success is often missing. In convening the nation's governors for only the third time in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> history, President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who has vowed to be the `` education president,'' implored parents to become full partners in the education of their children. ... For the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to regain its standing in a rapidly changing world as the best and brightest, it will not be a measure of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> or the 50 governors. It will be a measure of individual commitment to do better.

 A time bomb exploded in a crowded market Wednesday and police said four people were killed, including three members of a family involved in a land dispute. Police reported four other people wounded in the explosion in a parking area at the Sadar Bazaar in northern <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Delhi </LOCATION>. Residents of the area said 13 people were hurt. Those killed included the wife and two granddaughers, aged 4 and 8, of <PERSON> Abdul </PERSON> <PERSON> Razak </PERSON>, who operates the parking lot on the disputed land. The fourth victim was a customer. At least four scooters in the lot were badly damaged and many were spattered with blood. <PERSON> Razak </PERSON>, 65, his white T-shirt stained with blood, said the bombing probably resulted from a land dispute with a neighboring shopkeeper that has been in court more than 25 years. Police did not confirm the allegation, but a senior official said they were `` investigating all angles.'' No arrests were reported. Investigators searched the debris for clues and remnants of the bomb, the police said. A senior officer at the site, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the bomb was put in a plastic jug wrapped in cloth and hidden under a wooden platform where <PERSON> Razak </PERSON>'s relatives were sitting. A canvas thatch over the parking area was blown down when the bomb went off just after 10 a.m.. A member of the bomb disposal squad said: `` It was a crude bomb but had a powerful blast.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> engineers raised a bridge dangling at a 45-degree angle in the water today in an effort to restore the link to two islands cut off from the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> mainland by Hurricane Hugo 13 days ago. High tide this morning helped lift the 500,000-ton bridge, and workers used a crane to restore it to its stand. Officials said they hoped to have the ends of the <LOCATION> Ben </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sawyer </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION> connected to the road later in the day so that it could be inspected and reopened to traffic Thursday to hurricane-devastated <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> and the Isle of Palms. Without the bridge, building and cleaning supplies have had to be flown or ferried over in boats. `` The people just wanted to get back in their homes and get started digging out,'' said <PERSON> Melvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderegg </PERSON>, mayor of <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>'s Island `` Everywhere you look over there, people are cleaning up and moving things.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> had to turn away dozens of boaters who filled the waterway to watch the bridge repair. Officials nevertheless were eager for the public to know that life is returning to normal in an area that boasts 60 miles of beaches and attracted 10 million visitors last year. More than 1,000 truckloads of debris a day are being removed from <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>, the city where the Civil War began. `` We've bounced back from Hurricane Hugo and visitors should not cancel their plans to come to <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> but should come right ahead,'' said Mayor <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Riley </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, who wore a T-shirt saying `` <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>. We're Going Strong. The mayor said Tuesday that 90 percent of the city's hotels have reopened, and a 9 p.m. to 5 a.m. curfew should be lifted shortly. Criticism of federal relief efforts continued along with the recovery. Sen. <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Hollings </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-S.C. </LOCATION>, called for the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' watchdog agency, to investigate the `` incompetent'' work of the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Hollings </PERSON> again complained that the agency has not opened enough offices in the 22 <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> counties declared a federal disaster area. There are about 10 offices opened in those areas. <ORGANIZATION> FEMA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> McAda </PERSON> said he would welcome an investigation, and said the agency was fulfilling its role of aiding long-term recovery. `` I believe we're doing that and under the circumstances doing it as fast as it can be expected to be done,'' he said. That view was seconded by <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, the vice president's wife, who helped at disaster and <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> centers in <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> on Tuesday `` From what I've been able to observe, <ORGANIZATION> FEMA </ORGANIZATION>, very frankly, got a bum rap,'' she said. The agency has 350 workers in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> to process applications from people seeking low-interest loans and grants to rebuild homes and businesses. Hurricane Hugo roared into the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> coast Sept. 21, leaving at least 18 dead, 50,000 homeless, 270,000 jobless, and a swath of damage extending into <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>. In all, 29 people were killed on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> mainland. Damage in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> alone has been estimated at at least $ 3 billion. In the community of <LOCATION> Murrells </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Inlet </LOCATION> about 10 miles south of <LOCATION> Myrtle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, author <PERSON> Mickey </PERSON> <PERSON> Spillane </PERSON> examined the wreckage of his home and office, where he has written detective novels since 1963. One section of a wall was gone, and first editions of his books, including `` I, The Jury,'' and `` My Gun is Quick,'' had disappeared, as well as a manuscript in progress. But the author was n't too upset. `` Hey, not to worry,'' he said. `` I'll make -LRB- the manuscript -RRB- up in two weeks, ... maybe three. That's how long it takes to write a book.''

 <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION>'s President <PERSON> Mobutu </PERSON> <PERSON> Sese </PERSON> <PERSON> Seko </PERSON> and President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> met today in efforts to bolster the faltering truce accord between <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>'s government and its U.S.-armed opposition. <PERSON> Mobutu </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to attend the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>, made a quick trip to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for the meeting as part of intensive behind-the-scenes <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> efforts to prevent the collapse of the agreement reached through Zairean mediation in June. The two leaders met for nearly 45 minutes. <PERSON> Mobutu </PERSON> declined to answer reporters' questions as he left the White House. Also in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> today were <PERSON> Jonas </PERSON> <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON>, the rebel who leads the Union for the Total Independence of <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-, and <PERSON> Pedro </PERSON> <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunem </PERSON>, the foreign minister of <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>'s Soviet-backed government. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have ruled out a meeting among all three sides but not a possible reconciliation meeting between <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mobutu </PERSON>. <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> is scheduled to meet <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Thursday. <PERSON> Mobutu </PERSON>, who has served as the major conduit of an estimated $ 40 million in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arms and other supplies to <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> annually, is supporting the Angolan government's interpretation of the June accords. President <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> dos </PERSON> <PERSON> Santos </PERSON> contends <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> agreed to temporary exile and to integrating his forces into the Angolan armed forces. At a news conference here Wednesday, <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunem </PERSON> accused <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> of not being `` willing really to commit himself to a process of peace.'' He told reporters the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should support the agreement reached last June, including <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON>'s exile and the integration of his forces into the government military. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunem </PERSON> said he had conveyed these thoughts to members of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee on <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and would tell secretary of state <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> the same thing when he meets him, probably next week. On Tuesday, Sen. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.C. </LOCATION> complained at a hearing of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> that <PERSON> Mobutu </PERSON> had cut the flow of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arms to <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON>'s forces, asking <PERSON> Herman </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON>, assistant secretary of state for <LOCATION> African </LOCATION> affairs, why that had been done. <PERSON> Cohen </PERSON> said that while it was an `` open secret'' that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has been aiding <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> in his struggle against <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>'s Marxist government, details of the operation are classified <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> said his question was not based on classified material and added: `` I can say publicly that the supply lines have been cut and you and I know why and who did it.'' <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> asserted that `` <PERSON> Mobutu </PERSON> got his hackles up because <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> would n't knuckle under'' to the terms of the peace plan. This week, both sides are currying <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> support in meetings with administration officials, members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the media. <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> is arguing for continued <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid _ he already gets one of the largest sums of covert assistance _ and for support of free elections that would allow <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> to share power. <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> is asking primarily for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> recognition, arguing that it has fulfilled <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s main demand by agreeing to the withdrawal of more than 50,000 Cuban troops by 1991. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials say the Cuban pullout from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> is proceeding as planned but that diplomatic recognition will be withheld until the government agrees to free elections. <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> is backed by a coalition of advocacy groups that has organized media briefings and demonstrations against <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> this week. Half-page ads this week in The <ORGANIZATION> Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, paid for by the Angolan government, said <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> was a `` dictator'' here to press for more covert aid. <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> is represented by a prestigious array of lobbyists and public relations experts. <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> supporters on Tuesday released the content of a letter written by Sen. <PERSON> Orrin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Utah </LOCATION>, asking Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> to investigate a major <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> supporter, the <ORGANIZATION> TransAfrica </ORGANIZATION> lobbying organization. <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> TransAfrica </ORGANIZATION> may have violated the Foreign Agents Registration Act by accepting more than $ 2,000 from the Angolan mission to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Randall </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON>, the director of <ORGANIZATION> TransAfrica </ORGANIZATION> who just returned from a fact-finding trip to <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, said the money went to buy tickets for the organization's annual dinner in which some 50 African and <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> countries took part. A <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said the <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON> request had been forwarded to the Criminal Division.

<TEXT>
 Troops loyal to Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> patrolled quiet streets today after crushing a coup attempt, and a military spokesman said two coup leaders had taken refuge at a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> base. A lawyer for <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> said the general was not detained or injured in Tuesday's uprising and had been away from the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> when the fighting began. It was the second failed attempt in 18 months by dissidents in the military to oust <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> chief and de facto leader of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was quick to blame the revolt on the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which has been trying to oust him for more than 1 -LCB- years and bring him to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to face federal drug trafficking charges. `` The proof is that <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> troops closed access routes to the barracks, just as they closed the Pan-American Highway,'' <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> said on nationwide television several hours after the failed coup by what appeared to be a small group of soldiers. At the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> today, <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s president, <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, also claimed that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops blocked roads during the attempted coup. `` There is proof, evidence of all kinds that there was such support which the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> armed forces in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> gave,'' he told reporters. He said photographs will be released later showing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> tanks blocking the highways. <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Ossa </PERSON>, the second vice president of the opposition <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democrats </ORGANIZATION>, was arrested following the coup attempt, according to a telex the party sent today to Panamanian exiles in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. The statement did not say precisely when the arrest occurred or whether it was part of a larger roundup. A <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, Maj. <PERSON> Edgardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON>, said two coup leaders, including Capt. <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Licona </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Cavalry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Squadron </ORGANIZATION>, had taken refuge at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clayton </LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> base in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said he was unable to confirm <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON>'s account. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> denied any role in the rebellion, but he reiterated that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would still like to see <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> ousted. `` I want to see democracy in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> succeed,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Tuesday night. White House spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration had some advance word that a coup attempt might be afoot. Some <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> congressional leaders said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should have helped the rebels. `` Once again we have snatched defeat from the jaws of victory, and I think it's an outrage,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.C. </LOCATION> Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> reserves the right to use force against <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, but he dismissed `` armchair generals'' who criticized the administration's response. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was indicted on federal drug trafficking charges in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in February 1988, but he maintains those charges are part of a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> plot to keep possession of the <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION>, which reverts to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> at the end of the century. He also annulled May elections after international observers said his slate of candidates had lost by a landslide. The coup attempt began at the headquarters of the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> at about 7 a.m. Tuesday, with the sound of gunshots and explosions echoing through the poor, crowded downtown neighborhood. Police, armored personnel carriers and water cannons blocked the surrounding streets. Some residents grabbed their belongings and ran. Sporadic shooting continued for several hours and the rebels read a communique on national radio saying they had toppled <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. Loyalist troops later surrounded the headquarters compound and more fighting broke out. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was away from headquarters at the time, said <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Takiff </PERSON>, one of several attorneys in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> representing <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> on drug charges. <PERSON> Takiff </PERSON> said he spoke with <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> today by telephone while <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> stood at <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON>'s side. Coup leaders `` knew he was not -LRB- there -RRB-, so why they moved is a mystery,'' <PERSON> Takiff </PERSON> quoted <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> as saying. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops moved into position only a few hundred yards from the fighting and temporarily closed the main bridge over the canal, but <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> spokesmen said those were only security measures. The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops did not take part in the fighting. About 50,000 Americans live in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, including more than 12,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military personnel attached to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Southern Command. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> never considered kidnapping <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, said a top <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> official who spoke on condition of anonymity. `` When it appeared as through <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> might have been dethroned ... there were several options considered, none of which involved going in and getting him.'' He declined to say exactly what options were weighed. The pro-government newspaper <ORGANIZATION> Critica </ORGANIZATION> said six members of the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> died in the coup attempt. <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> would say only that a number of soldiers were wounded and refused to be more specific. Former opposition vice presidential candidate <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> said at a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> news conference that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was not getting any stronger despite the crushing of the coup. `` The mere fact that a group of officers, young officers, have attempted to overthrow him, in my opinion, is important enough that he must be getting the message loud and clear,'' <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> said. Although <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> reported some civilian discontent, he also admitted it was quickly put down. `` I personally believe, and I say this with a lot of sorrow, that the <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> people are highly intimidated by the regime,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>, who was beaten bloody by thugs during a demonstration after his ticket won the May 7 elections. Tuesday's coup attempt was more serious than a failed coup on March 16, 1988, but it appeared that only elements of the <LOCATION> Urraca </LOCATION> battalion, which is in charge of security at Defense Forces headquarters, were involved. Although the rebel's only communique was signed by the battalion commander, Maj. <PERSON> Moises </PERSON> <PERSON> Giraldi </PERSON> <PERSON> Vega </PERSON>, <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> said `` more than 60'' soldiers and four or five officers were being held prisoner, far less than a full battalion. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> controls the country through his command of the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION>, and the failure of any other units to respond to the rebel call served to underline his control. `` Absolutely all'' other <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> officers remained loyal to <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, according <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON>. That loyalty was visible in the swift reaction by the elite Battalion 2000 and <ORGANIZATION> Macho </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monte </ORGANIZATION> units, which moved into <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> to put down the uprising from bases respectively 25 and 55 miles away. At one point the rebels announced by radio that they had ousted <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, and a few hundred members of the civilian opposition went into the streets to celebrate. But within half an hour <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> loyalists replied that the rebels were bluffing, and the good cheer faded.

 Fire engulfed part of a historic hotel being restored in central <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> today and one fireman was injured when a section of roof collapsed, the Fire Brigade said. Firemen called off a search for two plumbers after they were found outside the building, said a brigade spokesman, who spoke on condition of anonymity. One hundred firefighters and more than 15 fire trucks with aerial ladders tired to control the blaze at the old <LOCATION> Langham </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hotel </LOCATION>. The top four floors and roof of the 10-story building were ablaze, and it took two hours to put out the fire, the spokesman said. One firemen was taken to <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> with a possible broken leg after part of the roof collapsed while he was inside, the spokesman said. The <LOCATION> Langham </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hotel </LOCATION> on <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Place </LOCATION>, built in 1864, was the forerunner of <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s grand hotels, constructed in the style of a Florentine palace with plaster-relief ceilings and mosaic flooring by Italian craftsmen.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday that the net income of farm cooperatives last year rose to nearly $ 1.7 billion, continuing a rebound from the sharp declines of the mid-1980s. Combined business volume of cooperatives in 1988 was reported at $ 66.3 billion, up 10.3 percent from $ 60.2 billion in 1987. The record was $ 73 billion in 1984. The $ 1.7 billion for net income was up 13 percent from $ 1.5 billion in 1987 and was almost two-and-a-half times the 1986 level of $ 688 million. Last year's net income was exceeded only by $ 1.9 billion in 1980 and $ 1.8 billion in 1976. <PERSON> Randall </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Torgerson </PERSON>, administrator of the department's <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cooperative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, attributed the 1988 growth primarily to drought-induced higher prices for grains, oil-bearing crops and feed Production of feed grains and soybeans dropped sharply because of last year's drought. Total cooperative business volume includes the value of products sold by marketing co-ops; the sales of farm supplies such as fertilizer, chemicals, fuels and feed to members and other customers; and receipts from services such as trucking, storage, ginning and drying. Despite business increase, the total number of co-ops and members continued a long-time downward trend in 1988. <PERSON> Torgerson </PERSON> said the number of co-ops dropped to 4,939 from 5,109 primarily as the result of reorganizations through mergers, consolidations and acquisitions. Memberships totaled 4.19 million, down 5.6 percent from 1987. The number of co-op memberships is larger than the number of farms in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> _ less than 2.2 million _ because many farmers belong to more than one cooperative. Memberships averaged 848 per association, compared with 869 in 1987.

 <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Haig </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, a former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> secretary of state, said Wednesday the West must not drive <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> into isolation, and recommended that a freeze on new credit be lifted. <PERSON> Haig </PERSON>, the most prominent American to visit <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> since the army crackdown on pro-democracy protests June 3-4, said meetings with Chinese leaders reassured him <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> is serious about keeping its doors open to the world. `` Regardless of your point of view,'' <PERSON> Haig </PERSON> said in an interview shortly before his departure, `` we simply must continue to communicate with Chinese leaders.'' While in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> for a business symposium, <PERSON> Haig </PERSON> met with Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON>, President <PERSON> Yang </PERSON> <PERSON> Shangkun </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jiang </PERSON> <PERSON> Zemin </PERSON>, the new Communist Party chief. He spoke briefly with senior leader <PERSON> Deng </PERSON> <PERSON> Xiaoping </PERSON> on the rostrum of <LOCATION> Tiananmen </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gate </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Haig </PERSON>, who heads a private consulting firm, said the `` overriding imperative'' of Western governments now `` is to avoid driving <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> into resentful and angry isolation.'' He praised President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for showing `` restraint on excessive overreaction'' but said the time had come to reconsider the policy, backed by most Western countries and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, of freezing action on new credit by such international lending institutes as the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. Withholding of new loans `` could affect the people of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>,'' he said, and `` I do n't think that should be restrained too much longer.'' Most Western nations have halted high-level official contacts and suspended arms sales, as well as cutting off new credit, to show their outrage over the Chinese government's violent suppression of dissent. The former secretary of state said the message to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> should be: `` We were mad, we reacted, but we've got to go on.'' <PERSON> Haig </PERSON> said Chinese-American contacts, resumed 18 years ago, have been `` fundamentally advantageous'' to world peace and regional stability. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> businesses must assess the risks of investing in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, which in addition to political turmoil is undergoing an economic austerity program to combat excessive growth and serious gaps between supply and demand, <PERSON> Haig </PERSON> said. He added, referring to businesses already here: `` I would not advise them to pick up stakes and pull out. ... I still think there's a lot of good business to be done in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>.'' Noting that 20-25 percent of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s gross national product is directly related to international commerce, <PERSON> Haig </PERSON> said: `` Even if there were an intention to reverse that, it could not be done without serious repercussions, which I do n't think any leadership in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> would risk.'' <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> blames the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for the current strain in relations, contending that a nation's relations with others should not be affected by its domestic policies.

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 When it comes to holding down cholesterol, when you eat may turn out to be as important as what you eat. A study has found that people who nibble all day instead of eating three square meals have signficantly lower blood cholesterol levels. The researchers said this means that cholesterol levels `` may be lowered by increasing meal frequency alone, with no alteration in the nature or amount of the food eaten.'' However, they said they did not advocate putting people on the diet they tested, which they described as `` an extreme model of nibbling.'' In the study, conducted at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Toronto </ORGANIZATION>, seven men ate 2,500 calories a day. For one two-week period, they got their food in three ordinary-size meals. But for another two weeks, they got the same amount of calories in 17 snacks eaten once an hour. The nibbling diet lowered their total cholesterol levels by 9 percent and their levels of hazardous low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, or LDL, by 14 percent. Nutritionists generally discourage people from eating this way, because snackers tend to take in more calories over the course of the day and put on weight. However, some population studies suggest that those who eat frequently rather than gorging on one or two meals a day have healthier hearts. The researchers said that what they found `` is consistent with the claim that increasing meal frequency while maintaining a constant caloric intake may have a role in the prevention of heart disease.'' Why this might be is unclear. The researchers speculated that nibbling might somehow help by lowering insulin levels or prompting the liver to make less cholesterol. The study, directed by Dr. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> J.A </PERSON>. <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON>, was published in Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine.

 The state seized control of <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s 28,000-student school system today, making it the biggest urban district in the nation to be taken over for failing to do its job State officials charged that the school system in the gritty, impoverished community across the <LOCATION> Hudson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> is academically bankrupt and rife with corruption, mismanagement and patronage. At least four other states have school takeover laws, and two _ <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> _ have seized districts deemed failures. The state <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> gave final approval to the takeover and appointed <PERSON> Elena </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Scambio </PERSON> to a three-year term as superintendent. Under <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> law, the state has five years to make improvements. The move gives the state extraordinary power in <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, the state's second-largest district and the first to be taken over by the state. Ms. <PERSON> Scambio </PERSON> can fire administrators, abolish the local board of education and set policy. The <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> school system has a staff of 3,322 and a budget for the current year of about $ 180 million. Enrollment is 44 percent black, 34 percent Hispanic and 13 percent white. Fifty-five percent of the students are involved in compensatory, bilingual or special education programs. Today's decision was expected and ends a long process that was strongly pushed by Gov. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kean </PERSON>, who has billed himself `` the education governor.'' Ms. <PERSON> Scambio </PERSON>, who will give up her job as <LOCATION> Essex </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> schools superintendent, has vowed to make <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> a national model of urban education. But her immediate plans were unclear. State board Vice President <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Woodruff </PERSON>, reading a resolution, said the district's problems were `` deep-rooted and endemic. The <ORGANIZATION> Jersey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> board of education totally failed to meet its obligations.'' There are `` severe long-standing, deep-rooted deficiencies permeating all aspects of the school system,'' the resolution said. The state had cited political intrusion in hiring, poor test scores, failure to provide a safe and clean environment, violations of bidding laws, failure to provide for handicapped children and unauthorized use of funds. `` The idea of takeover does not come easily to me,'' said Education Commissioner <PERSON> Saul </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooperman </PERSON>. `` I've always believed the role of the <ORGANIZATION> state </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> department </ORGANIZATION> is to help others help themselves.'' <PERSON> Cooperman </PERSON> said the state is initiating the takeover `` not because we want to. It's because we have to. If not us, who? If not now, when?'' National education groups say they will closely monitor the takeover. <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> McDonald </PERSON>, a researcher for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> have laws allowing state takeovers of failing districts. She said laws in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION> let the state eliminate deficient districts, an <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> law allows the state to revoke a troubled district's charter and <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION> may impose heavy financial penalties on such districts. This summer, an administrative law judge agreed state officials had the power to take over the district. He noted that some of the district's textbooks are more than 30 years old. <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> officials bitterly fought the takeover, saying the problems were caused by a prior administration and that the state trumped up its case against the district. Opponents also question whether the state can improve conditions in <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, saying <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>'s system of funding schools has crippled urban districts.

<HEAD>`Simple Little Bill' Now Loaded Down With Tax Goodies</HEAD>

<BYLINE>AP Tax Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 It began as a simple little bill to reduce the budget deficit by $ 5.3 billion. But as Tuesday night faded into Wednesday morning, the bill ballooned into a multibillion-dollar package of tax goodies for a parade of special interests. It was tax time at the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and there were a lot of winners: lower-income parents, some of the nation's wealthiest retirees, oil producers, owners of tuxedo rental companies, timber growers, banana farmers, rural hospitals, first-time homebuyers, the self-employed, parents who adopt handicapped children And, of course, workers who want to use Individual Retirement Accounts to shelter income from the taxman. In the biggest fight of the day, liberalized IRAs, favored by most Democrats, won out over a cut in capital-gains taxes, which Republicans preferred. That issue will be fought another day on the floor of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, perhaps as early as Friday. When the deficit-reduction bill with all its attached amendments is debated by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, Republicans will try to strike the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> provision and substitute a capital-gains cut for individuals and corporations. They failed by a 10-10 tie vote to do that in committee. The <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> plan provides that, the longer an individual held a piece of property, stock or other investment, the less of the profit would be taxed when sold. For example, 95 percent of the profit from property sold after a year would be taxed; 70 percent would be taxed if sold after six years. That plan is patterned after President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposal but considerably different from the one that the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s endorsement, adopted last week However the fight over capital gains and IRAs is decided _ and the final bill could contain parts of both _ most of the direct tax saving would go to people with incomes above $ 50,000 a year. While those issues will command the attention of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, many other parts of the big deficit-reduction bill will not even be mentioned in public debate. `` This bill as it has progressed has become increasingly more troubling,'' Sen. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.J. </LOCATION>, groused as the panel wound up action on the legislation just before 2:30 a.m. Wednesday. `` We end up raising $ 37 billion -LRB- in taxes over five years -RRB- to meet a $ 5.3 billion'' deficit-reduction goal, he said. Here are some of the scores of provisions that were tacked onto the bill by the committee: _ New assistance to rural hospitals, many of which are financially stressed because federal <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> reimbursements favor urban facilities _ Expanding the oil-depletion allowance for owners of wells that produce fewer than 15 barrels a day Producers whose natural gas is in `` tight sand'' formations would get an additional incentive totaling $ 685 million over five years. _ Permitting banana and pineapple growers to use a more advantageous system of accounting, a $ 25 million benefit _ A liberalized package of tax-related aid to lower-income families with children, including a new credit for health insurance and supplements for families with children under age 4 _ Raising from the current $ 8,880 to $ 14,520 the annual amount a person age 65 through 69 may earn without losing a portion of Social Security benefits This would help fewer than 10 percent of beneficiaries _ those whose earnings exceed $ 8,800 _ at a cost of $ 1 billion a year. _ Reducing from five years to two years the minimum time period over which owners of rental tuxedo firms may depreciate their inventories, saving owners $ 29 million over five years _ Permitting deduction of certain costs of adopting hard-to-place children _ Extending through 1991 expiring tax benefits for employer-paid legal and educational assistance, and for health insurance costs for the self-employed; and making permanent credits designed to help first-time homebuyers, corporations that increase research spending and investors in low-income rental housing _ Restoring the income-averaging benefit for farmers; they could use losses from bad years to offset taxes owed in good years _ Allowing timber growers to avoid a 1986 requirement that they `` materially participate'' in managing a timber crop before using losses from such activity to offset taxes on other income _ Granting amnesty from 1985 backward to taverns that have failed to pay an annual occupational tax _ Allowing the use of tax-exempt bonds to construct private spots stadiums _ Requiring the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> to mail annual statements of earnings and benefits to all people 60 and older, starting in 1995 Beginning in 1999, annual statements would have to be mailed to every worker. _ Ensuring that the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> notify taxpayers who are entitled to refunds but neglect to claim them

<TEXT>
 A new educational group said Wednesday that the agricultural export policies of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> are linked to Third World development, sometimes to the disadvantage of poor countries. The Trade and Development Program was recently established to help educate Americans about the importance of farm and trade policy to the Third World. `` We all need to make these vital connections between our food, farmers and trade policy,'' said the program's chairman, <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Grazer </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION>. `` Education of our citizens is critical, so they can make informed decisions and join in the policy process.'' The non-profit, Washington-based program is sponsored by 10 church and farm organizations and is funded by a grant from the W.K. <ORGANIZATION> Kellogg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>. Educational materials, including video tapes, have been prepared for use by farm, church and community groups to `` explore the linkages'' between trade policies and Third World development. <PERSON> Atherton </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, former agriculture minister of the Commonwealth of <LOCATION> Dominica </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> Caribbean </LOCATION> island nation, said measures to help <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and European farmers, such as export subsidies on grains, have damaged the fragile economies of developing countries. The export push was stepped up by the 1985 farm law, in which <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> created export `` incentives'' or subsidies to sell more <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> commodities overseas, partly in response to similar incentives in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, he said. As a result, the subsidized lower prices have helped consumers but often have hurt farmers and slowed agricultural development in many nations, <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said. In a report outlining its goals and some of the challenges, the program said no attempt will be made to reach a consensus or to advocate specific trade and agricultural policies. However, it said sponsors share a number of views: _ Agricultural trade policies should be more sensitive to the interests of farmers, farm workers, consumers and poor people throughout the world _ Broad participation in community, national and international decision making is crucial _ Individual and community stewardship, supported by sound public policies, is critical in the care and preservation of global resources The common goals also state that `` maintaining <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> family farmers and vital rural communities is important to the fabric of the nation'' and that these are important resources throughout the world. `` Moderate-sized farms, development projects or trading enterprises are generally preferable to large-scale undertakings,'' the report said. The sponsors are Bread for the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> on Hunger and Development, the Center for Rural Affairs, the <ORGANIZATION> Evangelical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lutheran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Friends </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legislation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Educational </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farmers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farmers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grange </ORGANIZATION>, the Presbyterian Church -LRB- USA -RRB- and the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conference </ORGANIZATION>.

 PERTH-ANDOVER, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brunswick </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ A <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> tanker jet exploded in the air just above the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> border today, killing at least three crewmen, authorities said. The fourth crewman was missing and feared dead. `` I've never seen anything like it _ it was like fireworks,'' said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> McNally </PERSON>, a resident who said he saw the explosion before dawn. The KC-135 was returning to <ORGANIZATION> Loring </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> in Limestone, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, from a refueling mission when it went down around 6 a.m. and set woods on fire near Perth-Andover, a community of about 1,900, the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> said. <PERSON> Loring </PERSON> spokeswoman Capt. <PERSON> Kellie </PERSON> <PERSON> Rebscher </PERSON> said that the plane exploded in the air and that a military-civilian panel would seek to determine the cause. <PERSON> Rebscher </PERSON> said the crew had been in radio contact with the Loring control tower minutes before the explosion but gave no indication of trouble. She said the plane had no `` black box'' cockpit voice recorder. Three crewmen were confirmed dead, and a search was on for the fourth, said <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Sgt. <PERSON> Darlene </PERSON> <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> said in a tape-recorded statement that there was a `` low probability of any survivors.'' The KC-135 Stratotanker is a <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 707 reconfigured as a tanker for refueling fighters and bombers in the air. It has no ejection mechanism, but has emergency exits. <PERSON> Rebscher </PERSON> said she did not know how much fuel the plane was carrying or its altitude at the time of the explosion. `` The noise! My whole house shook _ windows and everything,'' said <PERSON> Anita </PERSON> <PERSON> Davenport </PERSON>, who lives across from the crash site. <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Gamblin </PERSON>, who owns the woods where the debris landed, said he was on the scene in less than five minutes and saw no sign of survivors or parachutes. He said chunks of twisted metal and other debris were scattered over a half-mile radius around his farm. `` The flight pattern goes right over our house all the time,'' he said. `` If it had been a few seconds later, it would have been right in our yard probably.'' Sgt. <PERSON> Charlton </PERSON> <PERSON> Ritchie </PERSON>, a Loring spokesman, said the four crewmen were experienced and were training to keep their skills sharp. An <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> KC-135 exploded and burned Sept. 20 at <ORGANIZATION> Eielson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>, killing two people. On Jan. 31, all 19 people aboard a KC-135 died when it crashed on takeoff from <ORGANIZATION> Dyess </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. A KC-135 crash in 1988 killed six crewmen at <ORGANIZATION> Wurtsmith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>.

 It is n't tough to find a lawyer in <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> _ the state bar association says there's one for every 265 residents. But for people in jail, waiting two years or more for a trial, criminal defense lawyers are almost an endangered species. Around the country, those involved in the criminal justice system say the story is the same: Lawyers are fleeing criminal defense work for more lucrative business, letting defendants languish in jail while the overworked attorneys who remain in the field are tied up on other matters. `` It's very difficult, when one lawyer has 60 cases, to dispose of those cases when he's on trial for two or three months'' in one of them, said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fay </PERSON>, chief justice of the <ORGANIZATION> Rhode </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Island </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Dash </PERSON>, former chief counsel to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Watergate </ORGANIZATION> committee and now a <ORGANIZATION> Georgetown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> professor, chaired an <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> committee studying problems in the nation's criminal court system. `` The system is entirely snarled. There are not enough defense lawyers, prosecutors, police officers and judges,'' he said. And more lawyers might give up their defense work, especially in drug cases, because the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> said the government may seize lawyers' fees if the money came from their clients' illegal drug sales, said <PERSON> Neal </PERSON> <PERSON> Sonnett </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Criminal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lawyers </ORGANIZATION>. `` A lot of lawyers find themselves not litigating in defense of their client, but in defense of their own fees,'' <PERSON> Sonnett </PERSON> said. `` I've had lawyer after lawyer tell me they just do n't want the hassle.'' Too few criminal lawyers can lead to hasty and poorly conceived plea bargains that let dangerous criminals go free, or repeated trial delays that keep people in overcrowded prisons, <PERSON> Dash </PERSON> said. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON>, chief of criminal prosecution in the <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> attorney general's office, said victims also become more reluctant to testify as time passes, leading to more dismissed cases. Sixty-seven felony cases went to trial in 1988 in <LOCATION> Providence </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, which contains 60 percent of the state's population. The average time between indictment and verdict was 863 days, or 2.3 years, <PERSON> Ryan </PERSON> said. The state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in 1987 unanimously overturned a robbery conviction because a 2 -LCB- - year delay caused largely by a cumbersome court scheduling system had robbed the defendant of his constitutional right to a speedy trial <PERSON> Fay </PERSON> said the lawyer shortage is the main source of delays now that the scheduling system has been changed. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has 725,574 actively practicing lawyers, according to the <ORGANIZATION> ABA </ORGANIZATION>, or approximately one for every 340 people. <PERSON> Sonnett </PERSON> estimated fewer than 50,000 of them are defense lawyers, including public defenders. No one keeps tabs on how many of <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>'s 3,700 lawyers do criminal defense work, but several lawyers estimated the state has fewer than 20 private defense attorneys plus 32 in the public defender's office. Low salaries, unpredictable hours and a lack of social status all drive young law school graduates away from criminal work, <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> defense lawyers say. <ORGANIZATION> Edwards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Angell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>'s largest corporate law firm, pays newly minted lawyers $ 55,000 a year, and some <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> firms offer more than $ 80,000. The public defender's office, where many criminal defense lawyers begin their careers, pays slightly under $ 30,000, said Public Defender <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Casparian </PERSON>. Indigent <LOCATION> Rhode </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> defendants are represented by court-appointed private lawyers if the public defender can not take their cases because of a conflict of interest. Lawyers said those appointments would be a good way to help young defense attorneys get started if the fees _ $ 20 an hour out of court and $ 30 an hour in court _ were not so low. `` There are plumbers who make more than that,'' said defense lawyer <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> MacFadyen </PERSON>. Criminal lawyers also find their lives subject to unpredictable schedules of witnesses, lawyers and judges to a much greater extent than civil lawyers, said lawyer <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> DiBiase </PERSON>. `` You've got to get the court's permission to take a day off,'' he said. Criminal work also carries the stigma of guilt by association. Pawtucket Mayor <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarault </PERSON>, a former defense lawyer, spent part of his re-election campaign this year deflecting questions about a 9-year-old state police affidavit linking him to two drug suspects he once represented. `` Who wants to dirty themselves by going out to the prison or representing someone who's accused of some heinous crime?'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cicilline </PERSON>, defense attorney in several high-profile organized crime cases.

<TEXT>
 About 10,000 East German refugees began leaving <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> for the West today, and thousands of others reportedly lined the train route hoping to join their historic exodus. On Tuesday, for the second time in a week, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> leaders agreed to safe passage to the West for thousands of its citizens who had thronged <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s Embassy in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>, the capital Later in the day, the leaders banned unrestricted travel into <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> in a desperate bid to stop the embarrassing exodus. Fourteen buses carrying the East Germans from the embassy compound to <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>'s <PERSON> Lieben </PERSON> train station left about 4:30 p.m. The first train carrying 1,000 East Germans departed <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> about two hours later, reporters at the station said. Fifteen trains were made available by the East German state railroad for the transfer. The trains were to travel through East German territory via <LOCATION> Dresden </LOCATION> to the West German border town of <LOCATION> Hof </LOCATION>. The trains were originally scheduled to leave earlier today, but they were repeatedly delayed. One report suggested that was because would-be emigres were jamming train stations along the route, hoping to join the mass transfer. The <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> refugees waited through Tuesday night in near freezing weather, huddled in and around the embassy, many in tents on the embassy garden, which is roughly the size of a football field. `` We could n't survive a second night like this,'' said a <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> official, who requested anonymity. In <LOCATION> Communist </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, police scuffled today with 50 East Germans attempting to gain entry to the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>, witnesses said. Earlier, officials said 18 East Germans entered the embassy seeking passage to the West. Witnesses said about 100 East German police scuffled with the would-be refugees in front of the embassy. There were no reports of injuries. Witnesses said police also cleared the area of 200 bystanders. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said of the situation at the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy: `` We're talking to the East Germans about it and trying to get them to help resolve the problem through their emigration policies.'' Diplomatic sources also said that four East Germans were seeking asylum in the West German mission in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. There were reports that thousands of would-be emigres in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> were lining the route that trains carrying the refugees from <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> were to travel en route to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Hungarian radio said the railroad station in <LOCATION> Dresden </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, was jammed with hundreds of people hoping to jump aboard the special trains but that East German police cleared the station. However, in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Hessische </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rundfunk </ORGANIZATION> radio said young East Germans, their bags packed, had jammed other train stations along the route. The radio quoted Bavarian border police as saying the massive numbers in the stations were believed to be responsible for the delay in getting the East German trains into <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> to pick up refugees there. <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> agreed to have trains leaving <LOCATION> Czechoslovkia </LOCATION> pass through <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> before heading <LOCATION> West </LOCATION>, a face-saving measure for hard-line ally <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, which had vowed not to let the East Germans cross its borders to the West. In <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>, a West German <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Rothen </PERSON>, said today: `` We have no reason to believe the -LRB- train -RRB- delay is due to anything other than technical difficulties.'' However, a West German government spokesman, <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Klein </PERSON>, said on <ORGANIZATION> ZDF </ORGANIZATION> television today that the would-be emigres lining the train route could be a reason for the delay in picking up <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> refugees. `` That would be a plausible reason _ that some people perhaps would have wanted to jump on the trains going by,'' he said. `` That would be normal in the current situation.'' Meanwhile, more East Germans flooded the West German Embassy in <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, bringing to 400 the number there who were demanding passage to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Many of them, their clothing still wet, said they swam rivers and hid from police as they made their way to reform-minded <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, hoping to join the historic flight from <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. West German Foreign Minister <PERSON> Hans-Dietrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> said in a radio interview that he expected a solution for the refugees in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> as well. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s mass-circulation <ORGANIZATION> Bild </ORGANIZATION> newspaper reported that four East Germans had fled to the West German Embassy in <LOCATION> Sofia </LOCATION> in Communist <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>. East German leader <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> accused <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> of trying to `` destabilize'' his country by encouraging the exodus, which has severely drained its labor force of young, skilled workers. The rejection of its Communist system is embarrassing <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s leaders as they prepare to commemorate 40 years of statehood this weekend in ceremonies Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is to attend. <ORGANIZATION> Bild </ORGANIZATION> reported today that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> had pressured <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> into reaching a solution to the crisis. The newspaper, quoting no sources, said that `` <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> let <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> know he was willing to come to the East German 40th anniversary celebrations only if the refugee problem were solved.'' <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>'s curb on free travel effectively cuts off easy escape routes for East Germans, who also had reached the West via <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> after that country's liberal leaders opened their western border in mid-September. Hundreds of East Germans stormed through police lines and climbed facades and rooftops to get inside the embassy compound on Tuesday after crowding prompted West German officials to close it to more asylum-seekers. It is the latest wave of an exodus that this year already has seen more than 120,000 East Germans reached <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, where they are granted automatic citizenship.

<TEXT>
 The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration, under heavy pressure from <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to do more for the new government of <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, today proposed a $ 200 million grant to help that country restructure its economy. The aid, which would require congressional approval, would be in addition to $ 219 million in economic and food aid previously announced by the administration. The proposal came as <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Democrats proposed even larger sums of aid to the new Solidarity-led government than sought by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> _ and invited the labor union's leader, <PERSON> Lech </PERSON> <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON>, to address a joint meeting of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Nov. 15 to outline his hopes for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s future. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, meanwhile, invited both <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s new prime minister, <PERSON> Tadesz </PERSON> <PERSON> Mazowiecki </PERSON>, and communist President <PERSON> Wojciech </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaruzelski </PERSON> to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for consultations, press secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said in announcing the new aid. The White House announcement follows agreement by the 12-nation European Community to back a $ 650 million package of aid for <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> grant would complement the European package _ and would go toward a Polish request for a $ 1 billion loan from the West. However, <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the administration favored a grant as its share rather than a loan so as not to add to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s already staggering debt. `` The dramatic changes in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> over the past two months have lent new urgency to our efforts,'' the spokesman said. `` What <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> is doing is historic, in the largest sense of the word.'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the money would be disbursed only after the Polish government reachs agreement with the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> on an economic restructuring plan. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> also plans to send a team of experts, business leaders and administration officials to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> `` so that we can provide the most effective help,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. Democratic leaders of both chambers joined Tuesday to dismiss again <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s $ 219 million package of initiatives in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> as `` grossly inadequate'' and `` timid.'' They unveiled an aggressive Democratic legislative program of grants and loans with a potential economic impact of more than $ 3.7 billion. The three-year Democratic package would be composed of loans from international financial institutions, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> loans and grants, and a five-year halt in Polish payments on its $ 2.5 billion <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bank debt. `` Bold action today will be far less costly than timidity,'' said <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Mo </LOCATION>. `` For if we hesitate, and the opportunity is lost, we will be paying for it for a long, long time _ in an escalating arms race.'' <PERSON> Gephardt </PERSON> said it was ironic that a government that doubled <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military spending to respond to a Soviet military threat, `` now seems curiously paralyzed, unable to respond to the possibility of economic freedom, democracy and peace breaking out in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.'' But <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Seitz </PERSON>, assistant secretary of state for <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> affairs, denied such paralysis exists, saying <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>'s new plan for restructuring its centralized economy is `` in many respects a declaration of economic independence.'' <PERSON> Seitz </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee a Polish request for a $ 1 billion loan to stabilize the economy is `` under very active review at very high levels. There will be a response to that shortly.'' Rep. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>, D-Ind., chairman of the subcommittee, said the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration has established a `` clear pattern'' when it comes to aid to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> `` The president puts forward a proposal that is seen to be inadequate, pressure builds up to do more, and the president puts forward another inadequate proposal,'' <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> said. `` He is only moving in that direction because he is being pressured by the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>.'' The invitation to <PERSON> Walesa </PERSON> to address a joint meeting of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> was extended by <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, D-Wash., and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Maine </LOCATION>, who said the Solidarity leader has come to represent `` the yearning for freedom and economic opportunity that people feel in <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the world over. `` Guiding Solidarity to negotiate a transition toward free elections and then achieving a sweeping mandate from the people and then to take responsibility for the Polish government is close to a modern political miracle,'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said. The Democratic aid package includes $ 887 million in new <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economic and food assistance to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, of which it is contemplated that $ 415 million would be appropriated for use in the 1990 fiscal year that began Sunday. Democrats said the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> funds would be obtained by trimming appropriations for other programs but did n't identify what specific programs would be cut.

 A Lebanese hijacker convicted of commandeering a jetliner in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> in 1985 with two Americans aboard was sentenced Wednesday to 30 years in prison. <PERSON> Fawaz </PERSON> <PERSON> Younis </PERSON>, grabbed by <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents aboard a yacht in 1987 and brought to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to stand trial, told <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Aubrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> that `` I am not a member'' of any terrorist group. <PERSON> Younis </PERSON> said the two Americans on the Jordanian airliner were `` treated as friends'' by the hijackers during a 30-hour ordeal over the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> that ended with the 70 passengers and crew members being freed. The hijackers then blew up the aircraft. The judge ordered <PERSON> Younis </PERSON> to serve 30 years for hostage taking, 20 years for aircraft piracy and five years for conspiring to take hostages, following his March 14 conviction by a jury on three of six criminal charges. The sentences are to run concurrently. After the sentencing, <PERSON> Younis </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, promised to appeal the case on `` 20 different issues.'' He said that the question of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> jurisdiction is a critical one and that `` I do n't think it -LRB- the hijacking -RRB- had anything to do with Americans whatsoever. Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney <PERSON> Ramsey </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> urged <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> to impose a sentence of life imprisonment, but the judge said he would n't because no one was killed in the hijacking Jordanian sky marshals aboard the plane were beaten, but there was testimony at <PERSON> Younis </PERSON>'s trial that he ordered the violence stopped But the judge said a lengthy sentence must be imposed because time `` will never wipe out in the minds'' of the passengers and crew the `` terror'' they experienced. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Stephens </PERSON> called the sentence `` substantial'' and `` fair,'' adding that it `` vindicates the victims'' and sends a `` clear message'' to anyone `` who would engage in acts of international terrorism.'' Having spent the last two years in custody, <PERSON> Younis </PERSON> will be eligible for parole in eight years, said <PERSON> Stephens </PERSON>. But <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> predicted that <PERSON> Younis </PERSON> `` will never be paroled'' and that he will have to serve at least 20 years of his sentence, with credit for the two he already has served. Federal prisoners generally serve out two-thirds of their terms unless paroled. <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> said the federal law giving the government authority to prosecute <PERSON> Younis </PERSON> focuses on taking into custody someone who has `` slipped into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>'' after committing an illegal act abroad. In this instance, the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> `` reached out and dragged'' him here, said <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>. <PERSON> Younis </PERSON> was lured aboard a yacht in the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> on Sept. 13, 1987, with the prospect of a drug deal and a party, according to testimony at his trial. A member of the Lebanese Amal movement, <PERSON> Younis </PERSON> told the judge he had been `` kidnapped'' by <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agents.

 An <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION> couple who lost an environmental lawsuit against their county on a technicality won some sympathy, at least, at the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday. During an hour-long hearing, the justices showed little inclination to restore the victory it took <PERSON> Olaf </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hallstrom </PERSON> three years and $ 95,000 to win. `` Your case is an appealing one,'' Justice <PERSON> Antonin </PERSON> <PERSON> Scalia </PERSON> told the Hallstroms' lawyer but noted that asking the court to interpret a federal law contrary to its clear language is risky business. The Hallstroms' victory was overturned because their lawyer had failed to notify federal and state environmental officials, as required by the law under which they sued, before filing the 1982 suit. That lawyer, <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> Buckley </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, urged the justices Wednesday to `` look at the spirit'' of the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, one of at least a dozen federal environmental laws that gives private citizens the right to sue for enforcement. At issue is a narrow, but potentially significant, point of environmental law _ one that may affect the success of private citizen enforcement. The Hallstroms' suit contended that a county landfill adjacent to what's left of their 200-acre dairy farm caused or contributed to the pollution of their water supply. The couple's lawyer informed the county of their intention to sue well before the 60-day period required by the federal law. But <PERSON> Buckley </PERSON> did not give the same required notification to the federal <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> or the <ORGANIZATION> Oregon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Quality </ORGANIZATION>. A federal judge, however, allowed the lawsuit to proceed and in 1985 ordered the county to remedy federal environmental law violations within two years. The judge turned down the Hallstroms' request for $ 95,000 in attorney fees, and the couple appealed. The 9th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> in 1987 ruled that the Hallstroms' suit should have been dismissed before any trial because of the failure to notify. That left the Hallstroms at square one _ with the option of filing a new lawsuit. `` It's just not fair'' to make the Hallstroms `` jump through a judicial hoop that has no purpose,'' <PERSON> Buckley </PERSON> told the nation's highest court He argued that reinstating the Hallstroms' victory `` would effectuate the will of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>'' to protect the environment. But several justices voiced concern over straying from the clearly worded notification requirement that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> included in the law. Justice <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> spoke about the need for `` a rule that everyone can understand.'' Justice <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON>, while noting that interpreting the law as written `` results in an unfortunate situation in this case,'' said the law `` is workable as written.'' The court was urged by <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunsaker </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION> lawyer representing the county, to uphold the circuit court's ruling so government agencies can assess environmental messes before lawsuits are filed over them. <PERSON> Hunsaker </PERSON> said treating the 60-day notice provision as mandatory assures `` predictability and even-handedness in the administration of this law.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration lawyer <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> agreed that `` dismissal -LRB- of the Hallstroms' suit -RRB- is required.'' A <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision is expected by July. The case is <PERSON> Hallstrom </PERSON> vs. <LOCATION> Tillamook </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, 88-42.

<TEXT>
 East Germans jammed Western embassies, swam rivers and lined railroad tracks in at least four <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact nations Tuesday in a desperate bid to catch what could be the last freedom trains to the West. The flood of would-be East German emigres in <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> came as the beleaguered government in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> said it would allow one more exodus of disillusioned citizens. The statement covered an estimated 11,000 weary refugees who had converged on the West German Embassy in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>, but there were reports thousands of others throughout the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc were hoping take part. In <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>, the first of 15 trains began carrying East Germans to the West on Wednesday evening. `` We knew it was our last chance,'' one of the East Germans told reporters before departing. `` We were right, now the border is closed.'' <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, hoping to end the embarrassing exodus of its young, skilled citizens before the Communist nation celebrates its 40th anniversary this weekend, on Tuesday closed its border with ally <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> to keep its people home. Because <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> was the only nation where East Germans could travel without receiving special permission, thousands had streamed here to seek asylum. The clampdown on travel also was likely to severely curb the number of East Germans going to reform-minded <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION>, which spurred the exodus last month by allowing thousands of East Germans to pass through. The shortest route to <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> is through <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>. West German border guards noted that only 500 had arrived via <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> on Tuesday, compared to 700 the day before and 1,000 the day before that. East Germans were frantically trying other avenues to catch what they feared would be their last chance to reach <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, where they are granted automatic citizenship. In <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, police Wednesday scuffled with about 50 East Germans trying to enter the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>, witnesses said. Eighteen others made it inside the compound Tuesday, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomatic sources said. `` This is our last hope,'' said one refugee in the group of 10 adults and eight children. `` We're not going to budge until we know we'll be able to leave.'' In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration was talking to East German diplomats to resolve the crisis. In <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> in general, there were reports of thousands of frantic citizens lining the rail route that the weekend freedom train had taken. Police beat people with truncheons to disperse a defiant crowd of 5,000 that packed a <LOCATION> Dresden </LOCATION> train station and lined the tracks, chanting `` We want out!'' witnesses told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. The trains were to travel through East German territory via <LOCATION> Dresden </LOCATION> to the West German border town of <LOCATION> Hof </LOCATION>. The detour through <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> was requested by <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> authorities so that the refugees could be formally expelled from their country. <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION> had vowed not to let East Germans emigrate to the West across its borders. According to reliable East German sources, four East Germans still were seeking asylum in the West German mission in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. There were also unconfirmed reports that four East Germans had sought asylum in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION>'s embassy in <LOCATION> Sofia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bulgaria </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, the number of East Germans seeking asylum at the <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> swelled to 400. About 130 arrived Wednesday. Many _ their clothing still wet _ told of swimming rivers and evading border police to get to the embassy. <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s state railroad provided 15 trains to transport the 10,000 East Germans who had crowded the <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> embassy and the streets just outside it. The trains had been scheduled to leave Tuesday night but were repeatedly delayed. West German officials first said technical difficulties appeared to be the reason. However, later they said it could have been due to the East Germans lining the tracks in their own country hoping to join the exodus. `` That would be a plausible reason _ that some people perhaps would have wanted to jump on the trains going by,'' West German government spokesman <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> ZDF </ORGANIZATION> television network. Refugees in and around the baroque palace that houses the embassy fought the bitter cold with hot tea, huddling under blankets or wrapping themselves in jackets sent out by those who had found a place inside the building. Parents cradling children sat in the littered street outside. Inside the embassy garden, about the size of a football field, the trim lawns were trudged to a sea of mud. Police in the West German border town of <PERSON> Hof </PERSON> said about 1,000 young East Germans were waiting along the tracks near <LOCATION> Plauen </LOCATION>, an East German town near the Czechoslovak border. Hungarian and West German media reported thousands more had crowded other spots along the route the trains were expected to take. On Sunday, about 7,000 East Germans arrived in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> after <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> allowed thousands crowded in embassies in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> to leave. Many of those who arrived said they had jumped on board as the trains passed through their homeland.

 The nation's only university was closed Wednesday after thousands of students protesting the arrests of two student leaders clashed with hundreds of riot police. Fifty students were arrested. All 8,000 students were ordered to leave the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zimbabwe </ORGANIZATION> campus by noon Thursday. Police sealed off entrances to the campus as darkness fell. Riot squads barred students from entering the campus. The violence began after the arrests of student council officials <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Mutambara </PERSON> and <PERSON> Enock </PERSON> <PERSON> Chikweche </PERSON>. In a leaflet distributed before the start of classes, student leaders called for a meeting to discuss the arrests. The leaflet alleged police surrounded and stormed a campus residence and that <PERSON> Mutambara </PERSON> was `` profusely bleeding'' after jumping from a second-floor window in an effort to escape police. Student leaders said they believed <PERSON> Mutambara </PERSON>'s arrest was prompted by a statement he issued Oct. 2 criticizing the government and university authorities. <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zimbabwe </ORGANIZATION>'s vice chancellor, <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Kamba </PERSON>, announced the closing at a news conference after conferring with President <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mugabe </PERSON>. <LOCATION> Kamba </LOCATION> called the move `` regrettable and sad'' and said it was a university decision and not the government's. But student leaders, who requested anonymity, told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> they believed <PERSON> Mugabe </PERSON> had personally ordered the shutdown because of widespread student disillusionment with the leadership over top-level corruption. About 4,000 students boycotted classes and many fought running battles with baton-wielding riot squads through the day, a student spokesman said. Rioters threw stones at police and smashed the windows of a limousine used by <LOCATION> Kamba </LOCATION>. Sporadic clashes continued throughout the day and the semi-official <ORGANIZATION> Zimbabwe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> African </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said more than 50 protesters were arrested. They could face up to five years in prison. Students said police injured several protesters. In the past year, college students have staged several demonstrations in which they accused the government of stifling free expression and curbing academic freedoms. They also have protested official corruption. Education minister <PERSON> Fay </PERSON> <PERSON> Chung </PERSON> has called students `` hooligans and drunkards'' who were being manipulated by political opponents to attack the government.

<HEAD>Court Urged To Allow Cities To Crack Down on Sexually Oriented Businesses</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JAMES H. RUBIN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An apparently sympathetic <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> was urged Wednesday to bolster communities' power to crack down on adult bookstores, X-rated movie theaters and other sexually oriented businesses. Several justices vigorously challenged claims that a <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> licensing ordinance violates the Constitution's free-speech guarantees, while they seemed to react more warmly to arguments by a lawyer for <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> supporting the ordinance. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Weston </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Beverly </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hills </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, lawyer representing the sex trade in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, said the ordinance's broad authority to deny licenses is an unlawful `` prior restraint'' on free expression. The local law goes well beyond traditional government regulation of public health and safety, <PERSON> Weston </PERSON> argued during a 60-minute high court hearing. `` We're not dealing with nuclear power plants,'' he said. The law means `` one may not disseminate speech one has chosen to disseminate, absent a permit,'' he said. It `` permits the city to do indirectly what it can not do directly.'' The court previously has empowered cities to use zoning laws to limit the locations of sexually explicit businesses, requiring them to be concentrated in one area or spread out. But a ruling in the <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> case, expected by July, could give communities enhanced control through licensing laws. The ordinance, which took effect in June, requires sexually oriented businesses to obtain a license issued by the city police chief, who has broad discretion to deny one. Licenses are denied to anyone convicted of various sex crimes, such as obscenity and promoting prostitution. <PERSON> Weston </PERSON> argued that bookstores, and other businesses engaged in disseminating speech, should be given special consideration. He said that they should be granted licenses to operate within a reasonable time unless public officials can prove there is a good reason to deny them a permit. Chief Justice <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON> said there is no precedent for giving special consideration to bookstores that seek business licenses. Justice <PERSON> Antonin </PERSON> <PERSON> Scalia </PERSON>, in frequently barbed questioning, said to <LOCATION> Weston </LOCATION>: `` You mean that every bookstore can not be subject to normal business licensing?'' <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> City Attorney <PERSON> Analeslie </PERSON> <PERSON> Muncy </PERSON> defended the ordinance as a key weapon against crime and urban decay. The licensing rules are aimed at businesses that `` are 100 percent sexually oriented,'' she said. She said nothing prevents businesses from distributing their wares in other ways. `` They can sell the same material through the mails, door-to-door or on a street corner,'' she said. Several justices questioned whether the ordinance goes too far in denying licenses also to anyone living with someone previously convicted of a sex crime. But <PERSON> Scalia </PERSON> came to Mrs. <PERSON> Muncy </PERSON>'s aid by suggesting that provision legitimately would `` prevent evasion'' of the law by an ex-convict who wants to transfer ownership of the business to a roommate or live-in lover. The ordinance is being challenged by owners of adult bookstores, motion picture theaters, nightclubs and motels, but it also applies to nude-model studios and sexual-encounter establishments. The ordinance also bars motel owners from renting rooms for less than 10 hours, a provision intended to discourage prostitution. And establishments offering sexually oriented entertainment must be open to surveillance by authorities without search warrants. The 5th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> upheld the local law, saying it is a lawful attack on urban blight, crime and declining property values. Several groups have joined the <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> business owners in attacking the ordinance. They include the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Booksellers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Publishers </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> and the Freedom to <ORGANIZATION> Read </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>.

 Rescuers in boats and helicopters searched the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> today for eight people whose fishing boat struck a natural gas pipeline, causing an explosion and fireball that killed three other crew members. Three of the North Umberland's 14-member crew were injured when the 160-foot metal-hulled boat hit the pipeline just before dark Tuesday, a half-mile offshore. Four Coast Guard boats and several private vessels searched today, and the agency launched a helicopter after fog lifted. <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> and private helicopters with searchlights swept the area through the night until fog set in. The pilot of a privately-owned helicopter spotted the third victim just after noon today. The Coast Guard recovered the body. `` It was just a boom and big ball of fire went up into the air about 300 feet,'' said <PERSON> Allen </PERSON> <PERSON> Willett </PERSON>, a helicopter pilot for a company that ferries crews and gear to offshore drilling rigs. `` As soon as I saw what it was, I radioed back in and they notified the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION>.'' The spectacular explosion was heard by <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arthur </LOCATION> police on shore. `` It made a pretty big noise,'' Sgt. T.K. <PERSON> Donnell </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Willett </PERSON> said the boat was on fire when he reached it and spotted three survivors and two dead. `` We got three life rafts in the water and I hovered low over the water,'' <PERSON> Willett </PERSON> said. `` My mechanic jumped in. ... He got the one in the most distress, got him inside the life raft. The other two made it on their own.'' The mechanic, <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON>, and the injured men were brought to shore with <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> assistance. The gas line was shut off early today and the fires were put out on the pipeline and the boat, said <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> Lt. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> LaRochelle </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Merwin </PERSON> said he did not know who owns the underwater pipeline. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Benson </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said the agency was sending a team to investigate. Coast Guard Capt. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Collan </PERSON> said the <PERSON> Cameron </PERSON>, La.-based <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Umberland </LOCATION> was equipped with a fishing net, but it was not known if the net snagged on the pipeline and broke it. The North Umberland made daily runs for menhaden, a small fish commonly known as pogy and used for poultry feed, said <PERSON> Barney </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, spokesman for Houston-based <ORGANIZATION> Zapada </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heynie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which owns the boat. Three injured men were taken to <LOCATION> Baptist </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Southeast </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Beaumont </LOCATION>. A 53-year-old man from Sulphur, <LOCATION> La. </LOCATION>, was listed in critical condition with severe burns over 68 percent of his body. A 28-year-old <PERSON> Cameron </PERSON> man was listed in serious condition with burns on his face and arms, and a 31-year-old man from <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Charles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La. </LOCATION>, was in shock, but listed in good condition. Names of the injured and dead were not immediately available.

 The Panamanian rebels who tried to oust Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> had him `` in their clutches'' for several hours, according to some <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials who said today they are mystified as to why the insurgents let him go. The spokesman for President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` We do n't' really know if that was the case,'' and an attorney who represents <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> disputed the account. The officials, asking not to be identified, said <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was in the custody of the rebels for four to five hours after taking over the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> headquarters Tuesday. `` It's crazy, I do n't understand it,'' one official said when asked why the insurgents decided to free <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. The account was disputed by one of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s Miami-based lawyers, <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Takiff </PERSON>, who said the general was away from the headquarters when the fighting began. <PERSON> Takiff </PERSON> said he spoke with <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Edgardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> while <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> stood at <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON>'s side. Shortly before the rebellion was put down Tuesday afternoon, <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Blandon </PERSON>, a former <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> aide, told reporters in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> that he was informed by one of the leaders of the insurrection by telephone that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> had been wounded while in rebel custody. But when <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> made a brief public appearance after the rebellion was defeated, there was no obvious indication of any injury. White House Press Secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said today that the rebels on Tuesday `` indicated they had Noriega'' in custody, but `` We do n't' really know if that was the case.'' He said these individuals, whom he described as low-level, also `` made it clear they were n't willing to give up <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>,'' to face drug trafficking charges in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the spokesman added.

<HEAD>First Six Months of Pittston Strike Costly to Union, Company</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> strike against <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> is growing more divisive and expensive to both sides as it turns 6 months old Thursday, but the costs are remarkably even. Contract talks are on hold and the union leadership has raised the stakes of the strike by using mass demonstrations to choke off coal shipments. The <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION>, with a $ 100 million national strike fund, has been fined $ 25.4 million for illegal strike activities, mostly for efforts to disrupt coal production by replacement workers. The union also has been paying each of <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION>'s 1,695 union employees from <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> $ 200 a week from the fund since they went on strike April 5. In the first three months of the strike, the second financial quarter, <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> reported losses of $ 3.6 million compared with $ 9 million in profits the same quarter in 1988. <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> research director <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Buckner </PERSON> said financial statements from the next three months coming out in a few weeks will show the company losing at least as much in potential revenue _ or $ 25.2 million over six months. <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> also has a strike kitty _ a $ 100 million line of credit the company received in late 1987, <PERSON> Buckner </PERSON> said. `` We have charged that that is a strike breaking fund,'' he said. A <LOCATION> Russell </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> judge is expected to take away more <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> chips by once again fining the union, this time for taking over <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION>'s main coal preparation plant for four days in late September, the most dramatic act of civil disobedience of the strike. <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> Vice President <PERSON> Cecil </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> said similar unarmed invasions and occupations to cut off coal shipments will be mounted soon, regardless of the cost. `` This strike has been very expensive already,'' <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> said. He added, `` We're prepared to do whatever it takes to win.'' The union has said all along that money has little to do with this labor dispute. The main issues are not wages but job security and health benefits for retired workers. `` If we have to spend money to win this strike then we're going to spend it,'' <PERSON> Buckner </PERSON> said. Asked whether the union could afford the drain on the strike fund, <PERSON> Buckner </PERSON> said, `` The question is, can we afford not to protest <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION>'s actions?'' <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Odom </PERSON> declined to discuss specifics of production or financial losses. But he said, `` The violence and blatant violation of our rights under the law has cost the company a substantial amount of money during the six months of the strike.'' The union claims <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION>'s production is about one-third of its normal output. Tax records in the counties where <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> has mines show substantial decreases in the amount of coal coming out of the ground. However, records at <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> ports show little change in coal shipments since the strike began. Shipments by all companies using the ports has increased 20 percent through August, from about 25 million tons to about 30 millions tons, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Randolph </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Virginia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION>. `` There is little data to show any dramatic effects on <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> operations or on <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> production,'' he said. <PERSON> Buckner </PERSON> and coal industry analysts say that is because <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION> is buying high-priced coal from other companies to fulfill its contracts. `` That is indicative of the severity of the economic difficulties the company is having with this strike,'' <PERSON> Buckner </PERSON> said. To block coal shipments the union contends were bound for <ORGANIZATION> Pittston </ORGANIZATION>'s preparation plants, <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Trumka </PERSON> ordered selective strikes that began early Monday at two mines in <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> and five in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>. About 350 UMW employees walked off their jobs Monday and a union official said there was no way to tell how long that would last.

<HEAD>Senators Criticize Bush Choice for Agriculture's Top Natural Resources

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> chairman on Wednesday criticized President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s choice for a top natural resources job as more concerned about pleasing special interests than protecting the public trust. `` In government, the public interest has to come first,'' Sen. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON> told <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Cason </PERSON>, the nominee for assistant secretary of agriculture for natural resources and the environment during confirmation hearings. <PERSON> Cason </PERSON>, 35, has been a high-ranking official in the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> since 1982 and is acting head of Land and <ORGANIZATION> Minerals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON> said as a government official, <PERSON> Cason </PERSON>'s one assignment has been to protect the public interest. `` Time and time again, he has failed that assignment,'' said <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON>, who grilled <PERSON> Cason </PERSON> during two days of hearings on decisions he made at Interior. `` When it came to protecting the spotted owl, Mr. <PERSON> Cason </PERSON> chose timber interests over the public welfare,'' the senator said in his closing statement. `` When it came to getting tough on oil and gas companies who were not paying their fair share of royalties, the decisions were made behind closed doors. Key parties were excluded from meetings.'' <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON> said <PERSON> Cason </PERSON> tried to stop the government from collecting oil royalties, even where evidence of collusion or underpayment among companies existed. During questioning, <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON> said <PERSON> Cason </PERSON> changed an audit system when the oil industry reacted negatively to it, even though it was designed to collect millions of dollars in underpaid royalties owed the Indian tribes and the state and federal governments. <PERSON> Cason </PERSON> stopped audits of any leases negotiated before 1980, but allowed oil companies to continue collecting overpayments from the government for those leases, said <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON>. <PERSON> Cason </PERSON> said that by concentrating on audits of leases after 1980 and eliminating the ones that came earlier, the department was merely making the best use of its audit staff. In addition, <PERSON> Cason </PERSON> said the government could make more money through the post-1980 audits. <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON> chastised <PERSON> Cason </PERSON> for not consulting with the states or the Indian tribes before eliminating the pre-1980 audits. `` It's like a judge in a divorce case locking the wife out of the courtroom and dealing only with the husband,'' said <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON>. Sen. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Daschle </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-S.D. </LOCATION>, questioned <PERSON> Cason </PERSON>'s management abilities, saying a <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> report showed that a system under <PERSON> Cason </PERSON>'s jurisdiction for finding mining law violators has been defective for four years. <PERSON> Cason </PERSON> blamed the computer system and said the problems were being worked out. <PERSON> Daschle </PERSON> said `` it says something about management'' when after four years `` it did n't get better.'' <PERSON> Cason </PERSON> assured <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON> that if confirmed, he would work with the committee to set <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> policy. `` We have a plethora of statutes that require us to do some very difficult things,'' he said. `` During the confirmation process I have learned a lot. I have been exposed to new opinions.''

<HEAD>Suits, Fines on Industrial Waste Announced Against 11 Cities</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By H. JOSEF HEBERT</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> announced lawsuits and penalties Wednesday against 11 cities, including <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION>, accusing them of allowing untreated toxic industrial chemicals into public sewage systems. The action is the latest in a stepped up effort by the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> in recent months to force municipalities to take action against industrial plants that do not pretreat toxic chemicals before discharging them into public sewers. The latest suits brought to 61 the number of cities that have been targets of either administrative fines or civil lawsuits this year for violations of federal water pollution laws in connection with the toxic industrial discharges. `` We are sending a message, a very clear message,'' declared <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> Administrator <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Reily </PERSON>. `` No individual, no industry, no municipality will be allowed to violate environmental laws without the risk of sanctions and penalties.'' He said the enforcement actions reflected cases that long have been under scrutiny from the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> and where `` consistent problems'' exist in gettng local officials to assure that all industrial toxic wastes are pretreated before being allowed into public sewage systems. Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>, who joined <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> at the news conference announcing the latest lawsuits, said the actions reflect `` our determination not to sit idly by while our waters continue to be befouled.'' `` We simply can not allow harmful pollutants to reach our rivers and streams untreated,'' continued <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON>, adding that the lawsuits are not likey to be the last such actions. According to <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> estimates, there are more than 870 million pounds of toxic industrial chemicals _ including cyanide, arsenic and hazardous heavy metals such as cadmium and lead _ dumped into public sewage treatment systems each year. These wastes, which are combined with normal sewage and after further treatment are released into open waters, are legal as long as the toxics are pretreated at the source. When not pretreated they can damage public sewage treatment equipment, pose hazards to workers, interfere with the degradation of biological wastes already in the system, and contaminate fish and shellfish in open waters, officials said. Nevertheless, the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> estimates that one-third of the public sewage treatment facilities covered by federal law do n't adequately monitor such pretreatment or take adequate action against violators. The four lawsuits filed Wednesday were against <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>, whose city-run sewage treatment facility treats wastes from more than 400 industrial users; <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, where public sewage systems carry wastes from 100 industrial plants; and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, which together have about 130 industrial users. <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Antonio </LOCATION> agreed as part of the suit to pay $ 225,000 for past violations, officials said. Officials said other lawsuits filed earlier this week were against <LOCATION> Beaumont </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Tex </PERSON>.; <LOCATION> Dunkirk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Easton </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Punxsutawney </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>; and <LOCATION> Gloucester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. In addition, consent agreements were reached this week with Nacogdoches, <PERSON> Tex </PERSON>. and <LOCATION> Bellefonte </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION> for $ 60,000 and $ 64,000 penalties respectively. The federal actions allege that the cities have not adequately identified the industrial discharges, allowed discharges in ome cases without proper permits, did n't screen samples of the wastewater to determine if industrial plants were in compliance, and failed to take action against polluters violating the pretreatment requirements. <PERSON> Jessica </PERSON> <PERSON> Landman </PERSON>, an attorney for the <ORGANIZATION> Natural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Resources </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, praised the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> action, but maintained it was only a first step in getting reluctant municipalities to get tough with industrial polluters. Often, she said, `` it's like putting the fox in charge of the henhouse'' because in many cases the industrial polluter also is a significant political and economic power in a community. Last April a report of the practices of 502 municipal sewage treatment plants by the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, the congressional watchdog agency, also concluded that many cities are reluctant to take strong action against industrial polluters because of local political pressure and fears the companies might move elsewhere. The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> findings came before the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> began its stepped up enforcement program aimed at city-run sewage treatment facilities nationwide. Of the 61 cases _ including the 11 begun this week _ where administrative action or lawsuits have been initiated this year, about a third ended with fines totaling more than $ 2.1 million, including a $ 1.1 million civil penalty paid last August by <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> is seeking another $ 1.9 million in penalties in the two dozen cases that remain open, a figure that will increase when proposed penalties are added from the latest round of lawsuits, officials said. But some environmentalists question whether even those fines _ some as low as $ 2,000 _ are enough, noting the maximum allowed is $ 25,000 per violation, a sum that in some cases could mean millions of dollars in fines against a city.

 Character assassination is what Mayor <PERSON> Carolyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> calls her city's ranking at the bottom of a 333-city list of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> metropolitan areas. The upcoming edition of the `` Places Rated Almanac,'' which rates <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> metropolitan areas of 50,000 or more, reportedly has Pine Bluff at the bottom, but the publisher declines to confirm the rating. `` It's sort of like blackmail or something, a violation of character,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Robinson </PERSON> said. `` It's like a character assassination of your city.''

 Mexican President <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Gortari </PERSON> told a joint meeting of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday his nation intends `` to eradicate drug trafficking at its very roots.'' But <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON>, who is on a state visit to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, warned that `` at the world level, we are losing.'' He said that was unacceptable, and called for greater cooperation between governments to turn the tide. While vowing an all-out effort to curb drug trafficking, <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> firmly ruled out joint U.S.-Mexican military operations to fight the traffickers. `` The responsibility for the fight in our country is exclusively ours,'' he said. `` There will be no joint military operations on our soil. `` <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> intends to eradicate drug trafficking at its very roots in the sphere that falls under its responsibility,'' <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> said, speaking in Spanish while his audience of senators and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members read from English translations. Drug smuggling and the alleged corruption of many Mexican law enforcement authorities have led to complaints in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that have at times been so strident they have been dubbed `` <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> bashing.'' <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> appeared to be appealing for an end to this, saying, `` The time has come to build a new relationship free of myths and distrust, abuses and recriminations.'' He said that the worldwide fight against drug trafficking also is shared by <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> but that mutual accusations about who is to blame for the multibillion scourge waste time and effort. `` In <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, we now affirm that drug-trafficking is a threat to national sovereignty ... because, as in other nations, it corrupts whatever it touches,'' <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> said. Later, in a speech at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> will provide `` no haven and no sanctuary'' for narcotics trafickers. `` We will hit them where it hurts, in the pocket and in their personal liberty,'' he said. The Mexican president also used his speech to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to renew his appeal for greater Mexican access to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> markets, saying that while <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> has eliminated most non-tarrif barriers to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> products, `` we continue confronting them in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON> described this as an `` inequitable paradox'' and said <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> must have `` greater and more secure access to the world's greatest market, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>'' to obtain the economic growth that is needed to improve the lot of its people <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials disagree with <PERSON> Salinas </PERSON>' portrayal of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as a protectionist nation. They say two-thirds of <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>'s exports come to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and that <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> had a $ 2.7 billion surplus in its <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade last year on total two-way trade of about $ 44 billion

 Foreign Minister <PERSON> Hans-Dietrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> on Wednesday rejected charges from <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> that <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> sparked the exodus of East Germans to the West to destabilize Communist East <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. `` They believe in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> that they can destabilize <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> with a broad-based attack. But it will not work,'' East German leader <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON> said in a speech earlier this week. The state-run <PERSON> Berliner </PERSON> <PERSON> Zeitung </PERSON> in the Communist capital accused <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> of trying to `` provoke conflict and increase tension in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'' by allegedly luring the refugees. <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> rejected those charges in a radio interview Wednesday and again called for reforms rejected by <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>'s Communist leadership. `` A reform movement can only be carried out with political stability,'' <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> said in an interview with <PERSON> Norddeutsche </PERSON> <PERSON> Rundfunk </PERSON>. `` The federal government is opposed to any destabilization by words or deeds.'' Government officials in <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> also have denied East German allegations that <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> is attracting the refugees with false promises. Still, West German employers and government officials have made no secret of their delight in having the refugees, whose numbers have topped 43,000 since <LOCATION> Hungary </LOCATION> opened its borders to the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> on Sept. 11. Most of the refugees are young, skilled workers, who ordinarily would form the backbone of the East German economy. <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> already has admitted that the country's dissatisfied work force is suffering. <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> made it clear <LOCATION> Bonn </LOCATION> has no intention of changing course to placate <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. `` The West German embassies will stay open,'' <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON> said. The latest arrivals headed to <LOCATION> Bavaria </LOCATION> from the West German Embassy in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>. Despite the war of words between the two countries, numerous questions remain as to whether <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> has an ulterior motive in welcoming newcomers to one of <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s most densely populated countries.

 A federal judge on Wednesday dismissed the core of the nation's largest `` comparable worth'' lawsuit, a claim that <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> deliberately underpaid thousands of women in female-dominated state jobs. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Marilyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON> <PERSON> Patel </PERSON> ruled that the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Employees </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> had failed to prove deliberate sex discrimination in state salaries. She allowed <ORGANIZATION> CSEA </ORGANIZATION> to submit new arguments on a claim that state policies had the effect of illegally holding down the salaries of female state employees. But that type of lawsuit, without proof of intent, has been made much more difficult to prove by a recent <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> ruling. <ORGANIZATION> CSEA </ORGANIZATION> sued in 1984 on behalf of 60,000 or more past and present secretaries, clerks, nurses and other people in predominantly female state jobs. The lawsuit contended those jobs had been deliberately underpaid for decades because the employees were women. It sought hundreds of millions of dollars in back pay. The union described the lawsuit as a sex discrimination case and resisted the label of `` comparable worth,'' the doctrine that jobs of equal skill, effort and responsibility deserve equal pay. But the case has been generally described as a comparable worth lawsuit because it is based on pay disparities between different types of jobs, rather than claiming that women were paid less than men in the same job. The state denied discrimination and said any differences in pay levels reflected market rates. Lower pay for female-dominated jobs based on prevailing market levels was declared legal in 1985 by the 9th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> in an opinion by future <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Justice <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>. The crucial issue in Wednesday's ruling was whether the state deliberately discriminated against women in the 1930s, when state pay scales were revised. <ORGANIZATION> CSEA </ORGANIZATION> contended that the effects of unequal pay levels for men and women in those revisions persist today. But <PERSON> Patel </PERSON> ruled that documents from a 1931 salary revision, containing staff comments suggesting lower pay for some female-dominated jobs, failed to prove deliberate and systematic discrimination, and that the effects of any bias were largely eliminated in a further reclassification in 1937-38.

<HEAD>Expert: Healthy Women Need Fewer Prenatal Doctor Visits</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The chairman of a federal panel of experts said Wednesday that healthy women could get by with fewer visits to the doctor during pregnancy, but women at high risk need more and better prenatal care. Dr. <PERSON> Mortimer </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosen </PERSON>, panel chairman and head of obstetrics and gynecology at <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Physicians </ORGANIZATION> and Surgeons in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said healthy women whose fetuses are at no apparent risk now visit a doctor about 14 times during pregnancy. Eliminating or reducing some laboratory tests and procedures could cut five to seven visits from this schedule, according to the recommendations of <PERSON> Rosen </PERSON>'s panel, whose report was issued by the <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> this week. The report emphasizes the need for preconception counseling to warn women about the dangers of smoking, drinking and drug use before they become pregnant and recommends that this counseling be covered by insurance plans. It also recommends prenatal care be available to all women, though it did not estimate what that would cost. More than 25 percent of women receive poor prenatal care or none at all, <PERSON> Rosen </PERSON> said, resulting in a high infant mortality rate for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. For women at low risk for problems during pregnancy, `` some of the visits -LRB- to their doctor -RRB- do n't at least obviously contribute to the prevention of illness and the medical health of the mother,'' <PERSON> Rosen </PERSON> said. For example, he said, healthy women do n't need to be tested for protein in their urine at every prenatal visit and women who have had a Pap test within the past year do n't need another just because they become pregnant. He also said blood pressure measurements are n't necessary during every visit and more than one pelvic exam during pregnancy often is not needed. Ultimately, the schedule of visits should be determined by the patient and her physician, he said, adding that `` some women might want more contact -LRB- with their physician -RRB- and that is their right.'' <PERSON> Rosen </PERSON> said he expected some physicians will dispute the panel's recommendation for healthy women, but he added: `` Let the people who feel this is wrong test it. The panel did not estimate the savings that could result from less prenatal care for healthy women or the costs for additional care for women with fetuses at higher risk. But it expected considerably more public funds would be needed since many women who need better prenatal care live near or below the poverty line. However, providing more care before a child is born will save costs in the long run, <PERSON> Rosen </PERSON> said. `` Prenatal care must be accessible to all women,'' <PERSON> Rosen </PERSON> said. `` Front-loading of prenatal care is going to be more expensive, but ... by improving the outcome you'll have fewer babies in intensive care and they will become more productive members of society.''

<TEXT>
 The national police said Wednesday they had fired 2,075 officers, many for having links to drug traffickers, and the government urged Colombians to rally behind its 7-week-old war on cocaine cartels. The appeal by President <PERSON> Virgilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Barco </PERSON>'s government was issued Tuesday after the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> approved an emergency decree that allows those accused of trafficking by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to be extradited. Roman Catholic bishops issued a statement calling the murder of a Bishop <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Emilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaramillo </PERSON>, reportedly kidnapped by leftist guerrillas, `` vile, sacrilegious and pitiless.'' His death apparently was not connected to the drug war. Gen. <PERSON> Miguel </PERSON> <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON> <PERSON> Padilla </PERSON>, the national police chief, began an anti-corruption drive in the 80,000-man force in February, soon after taking over from a general who was forced out because of connections with drug traffickers. <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Tiempo </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> Bogota </LOCATION> newspaper, said in a story published Wednesday that 2,075 policemen had been dismissed or forced to resign for taking bribes from traffickers. It said hundreds of others had quit because of low pay or other complaints. Starting policemen receive about $ 150 a month. Col. <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Salgado </PERSON> of the national police told The Associated Press the story was accurate. The paper quoted <PERSON> Gomez </PERSON>, the police chief, as saying infiltration by drug rings made the dismissals necessary. <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Tiempo </PERSON> said the general noted `` the drug traffickers' great capacity to bribe at all levels of national life.'' In its appeal, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> _ President <PERSON> Barco </PERSON>, five Cabinet ministers and the attorney general _ urged Colombians to resist pressure from the traffickers. It cited bombings, assassinations and other terrorist acts intended to turn people against the government. The statement said traffickers were trying to create the impression that the government, by refusing to negotiate with them, was indirectly responsible for the violence. Although there has been no public demand for negotiations with the drug rings, the subject has become a daily topic of discussion and many Colombians support such talks. Barco and the others said they would not yield to threats and terrorism and repeated previous vows not to negotiate with the cartels. Reports said the government was preparing to extradite another drug figure. <PERSON> Caracol </PERSON>, a national radio chain, said authorities had completed the paperwork on <PERSON> Ana </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Tamayo </PERSON>, wanted by a federal court in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> on charges of conspiracy and drug trafficking. It said she could be extradited at any time. Army Col. <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON> said in an interview broadcast Tuesday that <PERSON> Bishop </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaramillo </PERSON> was kidnapped Monday in northeastern <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. He said the guerrillas apparently wanted to use the bishop to carry a message to the government, but the colonel did not say why he thought they killed the cleric.

 Cancer patients who lose hope when standard treatments fail are fighting to force insurance companies to pay for drugs and procedures that the insurers call experimental and beyond their coverage. The companies argue that they should not pay for unproven treatments ordered by researchers investigating new cures. The issue has brought together doctors, insurers, lawyers and judges to determine who gets what kind of care for potentially fatal diseases. The dilemma took on a human face Wednesday when a federal judge here heard arguments on whether to force a health maintenance organization to pay for a $ 75,000-to - $ 125,000 bone marrow transplant for a 22-year-old truck driver with testicular cancer Doctors said Dean Weeks of <LOCATION> Bernardsville </LOCATION> needed the transplant immediately. Minutes before testimony was to begin, <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sloan-Kettering </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> agreed to pay for the treatment out of charitable funds. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Bissell </PERSON> said he would hold a hearing on whether the HMO, <ORGANIZATION> Healthways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Woodcliff </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION>, should be required to reimburse Sloan-Kettering. Weeks was diagnosed a year ago and chemotherapy failed to stem the cancer. `` Hopefully, I'll get cured,'' said Weeks, who sat next to his fiancee during the hearing. `` I do n't know what to say. I'm just glad to have the treatment.'' His lawyer, <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Kovacs </PERSON>, said forcing the hospital to pay for Weeks could deny a future uninsured patient the chance for treatment. HealthWays' attorney, <PERSON> Jeffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pagano </PERSON>, argued that forcing the HMO to fund experimental treatments could harm the quality of basic care for all its members. <PERSON> Kovacs </PERSON> said the HMO never defined experimental. Weeks needs an autologous bone marrow transplant, in which his blood cell-producing bone marrow would be temporarily removed so high levels of chemotherapy can be applied that otherwise could kill the bone marrow. The procedure is considered non-experimental for certain kinds of cancers, but not others, including testicular cancer. It is used when standard treatment fails. In a parallel case in the same courthouse last spring, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Dickinson </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Debevoise </PERSON> forced <ORGANIZATION> Prudential </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and another firm to pay for the procedure for <ORGANIZATION> Nicholae </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dosza </ORGANIZATION>, 60, of <LOCATION> Jefferson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Township </LOCATION>. Some companies have also balked at paying for interleuken and LAK, or `` killer cell'' therapies, which stimulate the body's own response to cancer, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Wingard </PERSON>, an associate professor of oncology at <ORGANIZATION> Johns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hopkins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> who treated <PERSON> Dosza </PERSON>. The problem is the same for AIDS treatment, in which insurers lag behind federal approvals for new therapies, said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Stoddard </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Lambda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Legal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> and Education Fund. The insurance industry's cautious approach to new treatments is not based on monetary concerns, argued <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Pohli </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Prudential </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman. `` The issue is n't money, the issue is safety,'' she said. Insurers are justified in having a say in whether a treatment is effective or properly documented, said <PERSON> Jude </PERSON> <PERSON> Payne </PERSON>, a senior policy analyst for the <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>. A key problem arises when doctors vary drug dosages, or even uses, beyond uses approved by insurance companies. `` It really boils down to what is standard medical practice and what can be documented as effective,'' said Ms. <PERSON> Payne </PERSON>. `` I think sometimes there's a little bit of tension there.'' The insurers also argue that drug-makers seeking profits and researchers needing data should help pay for experimental treatments. `` It may very well be that in life-threatening situations where there's no alternative, an exception should be made'' for insurers to foot the bill even if a therapy is still being investigated, said Ms. <PERSON> Payne </PERSON>.

 Exiled Panamanians said Wednesday the failed attempt to topple Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noreiga </PERSON> shows his position is weakening and vowed the battle will continue. All agreed that in the short run at least, the victorious <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> will crack down even more on those who defy his authority. `` From this point on, there is going to be a lot of oppression against unallied military officers and against opposition people,'' said <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Endara </PERSON>, cousin of opposition presidential candidate <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Endara </PERSON>. `` This is going to be an excuse for <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> to retaliate.'' He said his cousin, now reportedly in hiding somewhere in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, will continue his highly publicized hunger strike and push for an economic boycott of the <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> regime by the people of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. Exile groups here say they are receiving desperate messages from <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> that other civilian political figures, including <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Ossa </PERSON>, a vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, are being rounded up by security police. <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> was careful to draw a line between the authors of the coup attempt and the opposition. He noted the insurgents never mentioned recognizing the opposition slate as the legitimate government of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, despite unanimity among international observers that <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> won the last presidential election. The coup does show that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is losing control of the military, <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> said. `` Over 300 military people are in prison in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> now,'' <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> said. `` Obviously, the man is terrified because right now he does n't know who is really with him.'' The coup attempt was the second in 18 months, noted <PERSON> Aurelio </PERSON> <PERSON> Barria </PERSON>, former head of <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s Civic Crusade, which organized last year's domestic opposition to <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. He now leads an exile aid group here. `` He has n't gained support in this period. He has been losing support,'' <PERSON> Barria </PERSON> said. `` The military institution is self-destructing.'' He cautioned, however, that the officers who staged the latest coup attempt seemed more interested in internal military disputes than democracy. `` It proves that isolated actions are not the solution,'' <PERSON> Barria </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Barria </PERSON> said he did not think the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should have intervened directly. But he said his contacts in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> were angered that broadcasts from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bases in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> failed to provide the populace with information on what was happening, which could have sparked more public support. <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> went further, saying a show of force by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops could have tipped the balance in favor of the coup. He said officers on the fence would have sided against <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> if they had seen evidence of military support by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. They agreed, however, that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s days are numbered. `` The fight for democracy is not over yet,'' <PERSON> Barria </PERSON> said. `` And <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has two strikes agaisnt him.'' To the average Panamanian political exile, the coup failure was devastating. `` My heart fell to my feet,'' said <PERSON> Rita </PERSON> <PERSON> Conte </PERSON>, who said her excited family had been planning to return home when they thought the coup was successful. While most Panamanians here strongly oppose <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, one of his <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> attorneys, <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Takiff </PERSON>, said no one should count the general out. <PERSON> Takiff </PERSON>, who represents the general in his fight against a <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> drug indictment, said he spoke early Wednesday to the military ruler's aide Maj. <PERSON> Edgardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON>, who had <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> at his side. <PERSON> Takiff </PERSON> said <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> dismissed talk about dissension in the military, and he also said the general, contrary to reports Tuesday, was never hurt or in the custody of the dissidents.

 PERTH-ANDOVER, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brunswick </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ A <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> tanker jet exploded in the air Wednesday over <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, killing at least three of four crew members, authorities said. A panel of military and civilian officials was being assembled in an attempt to determine what caused the four-engine jet to blow up and crash, setting fire to woods near this border town, <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> officials said. The KC-135A tanker was returning from a refueling mission to <ORGANIZATION> Loring </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> in Limestone, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, less than 20 miles from the crash site. `` Three bodies have been recovered, but not the fourth,'' said Capt. <PERSON> Kellie </PERSON> <PERSON> Rebscher </PERSON>, a spokeswoman at <LOCATION> Loring </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Rebscher </PERSON> confirmed that the plane exploded in the air and that it was not equipped with a `` black box'' that could have recorded crew members' final words. She said the crew was in radio contact with the Loring control tower `` a few minutes before the explosion and they never indicated anything was wrong.'' Efforts to locate the missing man continued many hours after the predawn explosion, which witnesses said looked like fireworks and felt like an earthquake. People living nearby said they heard saw a flash of light, then smelled burning rubber and diesel fumes. `` The noise! My whole house shook _ windows and everything,'' said <PERSON> Anita </PERSON> <PERSON> Davenport </PERSON>, a nearby resident. Chunks of twisted metal and other crash debris were scattered over a wide area, said those who reached the scene before the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> seal it off. The tail of the jet was fairly intact, coming to rest about a half-mile from the fuselage, which landed in a ravine. Cold winds dusted the wreckage with a light snow. The plane was returning from a refueling mission when it went down at around 6 a.m. in a heavily wooded valley north of this community of about 1,900 people, just across the border from <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fairfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> said. The jet, which <PERSON> Rebscher </PERSON> said was 25 years old, is a <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 707 reconfigured as a tanker for refueling fighters and bombers based at <LOCATION> Loring </LOCATION>. An aircraft needing fuel moves in behind the tanker plane and nuzzles a fuel-receiving arm into a long boom protruding from a KC-135. <PERSON> Rebscher </PERSON> said she was uncertain whether the Loring plane had unloaded its refueling tanks prior to the explosion. She also said she did not know the altitude at which the explosion occurred. The victims' identities were being withheld pending notification of relatives. Wednesday's explosion was the third crash involving a KC-135 this year. On Sept. 20, an <ORGANIZATION> Alaska </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> KC-135 exploded and burned while taxiing to park at <ORGANIZATION> Eielson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>, killing two people. On Jan. 31, all 19 people aboard a KC-135 died when it crashed on takeoff from <ORGANIZATION> Dyess </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. A KC-135 crash in 1988 killed six crewmen at <ORGANIZATION> Wurtsmith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Gamblin </PERSON>, who owns the woods where the debris came down, said the plane was `` coming towards our place'' when it exploded. `` When you think it could have been one of the planes that carry nuclear bombs, well, that's pretty scary,'' <PERSON> Gamblin </PERSON> said. `` If it had gone down 10 seconds later, it would've been right in our house.''

 Engineers replaced a faulty rocket computer Wednesday, and <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> officially set Oct. 12 for the launch of space shuttle Atlantis with a nuclear-powered planetary probe. Shuttle managers had expected to select that date on Tuesday but delayed the decision because of a problem in one of two computers on a rocket intended to boost the <ORGANIZATION> Galileo </ORGANIZATION> spacecraft toward Jupiter after it is released in orbit by Atlantis' astronauts. The bad computer was replaced by a spare, and <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> reported initial tests showed it was working fine and that there was no need to delay the launch. Oct. 12 had been the unofficial date for several months. Liftoff was set for 1:29 p.m. Officials said the two computers were supposed to `` talk the same language'' but they did not because one had a software problem. Because <ORGANIZATION> Galileo </ORGANIZATION> will be powered by two generators fueled by radioactive plutonium-238 dioxide, three anti-nuclear groups last week sued in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, in an attempt to stop the launch. The organizations filed briefs with the court Wednesday. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> is scheduled to file its reply on Friday. Judge <PERSON> Oliver </PERSON> <PERSON> Gasch </PERSON> has set an Oct. 10 hearing. The opponents contend that a launch accident could spread poisonous plutonium over heavily populated east-central <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> says that in tests the plutonium containers have been blown up, shot at and burned to determine how they would survive accidents. They have withstood pressures far greater than those generated in the 1986 explosion of Challenger, the agency said. Even if there were a release, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> said, it `` would have no appreciable adverse health effects on the population.'' If they lose the lawsuit, the anti-nuclear activists said they will try to physically halt the liftoff by trying to infiltrate the Kennedy Space Center on launch day.

 The owner of the historic <ORGANIZATION> Bedford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Springs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hotel </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday he had been notified that a bank will take control of his debt-ridden, 185-year-old resort. <PERSON> Asher </PERSON> <PERSON> Sky </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Sky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, told the <ORGANIZATION> Bedford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gazette </ORGANIZATION> that <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pittsburgh </ORGANIZATION> told him Monday that it would take the hotel's title in lieu of foreclosure. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Malecki </PERSON>, attorney for the bank, declined to comment. Sky was unable to meet the Sept. 30 deadline for paying back $ 4.8 million to the bank. The money was spent out of a $ 7.5 million loan in 1987 for renovations never completed because of a dispute between owners that ended up in federal bankruptcy court. The resort's clubhouse, 244-room hotel and golf course closed Friday. The hotel and 2,300 acres of mountain land were put on the auction block Sept. 21, but <PERSON> Sky </PERSON> rejected the high bid of $ 5.3 million as not enough.

 Two months after his first choice was rejected by lawmakers, Attorney General <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> is still looking for someone to be the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s civil rights chief, a spokesman said Wednesday. `` We do n't have a short list of candidates,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON>, press secretary for the attorney general. `` It's a difficult position to fill.'' The delay in finding a candidate raises the possibility that President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would not have a new nominee for the position before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> adjourns later this fall. `` The last guy who was nominated for that position took a few knocks, there are not a lot of people volunteering,'' <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> said of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>'s refusal to approve <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> to be assistant attorney general for civil rights. About a half-dozen people have been interviewed for the job since the panel voted Aug. 1 to kill the nomination on a pair of 7-7 votes, <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> said. After those votes, <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> said <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> was a victim of `` raw politics'' and accused the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> of establishing a `` litmus test'' that anyone nominated for the job must oppose recent <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decisions on job discrimination. But critics contended that <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> was professionally unqualified for the job, having never tried a court case and lacking lengthy experience as a lawyer. During his confirmation hearing in July, <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> stumbled several times when discussing civil rights cases, confessing at one point that he was `` new to the law.'' Several Democratic senators also expressed dismay that <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> would not criticize the high court rulings, which civil rights lawyers say will make it harder to win discrimination cases. <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> stuck close to the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration's policy, saying he would monitor the impact on those decisions to determine if legislation were needed to overturn them. <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> aides argued that <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> was a victim of timing as much as anything because he was forced to defend <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decisions that were handed down shortly before his confirmation hearing. They argued it was absurd to expect <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to nominate someone who did n't agree with his civil rights policies. <PERSON> Thornburgh </PERSON> quickly appointed <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> to head the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liaison </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> _ a post that did not require <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> confirmation. <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON>' duties include dealing with the very same civil rights groups that opposed his confirmation. On Wednesday, <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> argued that the rough treatment <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> received during his confirmation hearing has hampered efforts to recruit a new nominee. `` It's not an easy position to fill and part of the reason was the way <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON> was treated,'' <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> said. `` I could n't accept the notion that <PERSON> Lucas </PERSON>' demise in the committee makes it difficult to fill the job,'' said <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> civil rights attorney <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>, who lobbied against the nomination. `` There are hundreds of lawyers with civil rights experience in the country who would not have any difficulty passing muster with the committee,'' <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> said. The department, which conducts interviews and makes recommendations to the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, has not asked the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> to conduct background checks on anyone who has been interviewed, <PERSON> Runkel </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> conducts such background checks, which routinely take several weeks, before a nomination is approved by the White House. Once the nomination is made, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>'s own investigation can delay a vote by the panel and the full <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> for several weeks, perhaps months The spokesman declined to say whether the difficulty in finding a candidate means that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would n't have a nominee ready for <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> consideration before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> adjourns this fall. The civil rights division, which initiates criminal and civil cases to enforce anti-discrimination laws, is being run by Acting Assistant Attorney General <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>, who took over after the departure of <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradford </PERSON> <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON>, who headed the division during the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration.

 An amnesiac was reunited Wednesday with her <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> family after a 10-month disappearance but said that for now she prefers to stay in <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION> rather than return home. `` I have a family now. They are very warm people, but I still have no memory of them,'' said <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellish </PERSON>, who took the name `` <PERSON> Kitty </PERSON> <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON>'' from a slip of paper she found in her coat pocket. Ms. <PERSON> Ellish </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Akron </LOCATION>, who still prefers to be called <PERSON> Kitty </PERSON>, met with her mother and sister at the women's shelter where she has stayed since arriving mysteriously in <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION> in December. She was identified as the 50-year-old divorced mother of three after relatives saw national news stories about her. She plans to return to <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION> after a brief trip to <LOCATION> Akron </LOCATION> in two weeks. `` I have a family here,'' she said in a news conference at the <ORGANIZATION> Family </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, where she has worked as a cooking supervisor. `` They're very supportive. Otherwise, I would n't have been able to make it. I've been living here, just trying to find a life and a Social Security number.'' Ms. <PERSON> Ellish </PERSON> disappeared from <LOCATION> Akron </LOCATION> on Dec. 8. Two days later, <PERSON> Kitty </PERSON> awoke in a <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION> motel with a headache and bruises on one eye, her arms and legs. She did not know how she got to the motel and could not account for a 24 - to 48-hour period Her mother, <PERSON> Irene </PERSON> <PERSON> Christ </PERSON> and sister, <PERSON> Elise </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, flew to <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION> on Wednesday after police matched a missing-person report from <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> and the relatives heard her voice on the telephone earlier this week. `` I feel better than I have in the last 10 months,'' Ms. <PERSON> Christ </PERSON> said after the three spent some time by themselves, looking at family photographs. `` I never broke down.'' `` Time will take care of everything,'' Ms. <PERSON> White </PERSON> said. `` We want her to come home, but we want what's best for her.'' Ms. <PERSON> Ellish </PERSON> said she did not recognize Ms. <PERSON> Christ </PERSON> and Ms. <PERSON> White </PERSON> but did not doubt they were her relatives. `` I ca n't put this into focus. It does n't all register,'' she said. There's still that feeling of ` Why do n't I remember?''' At the time of her disappearance Ms. <PERSON> Ellish </PERSON>, a telephone company computer analyst, was having personal problems with her 18-year-old daughter and was being treated for migraine headaches and stress, her sister said. She also has two sons, ages 20 and 29. Ms. <PERSON> Ellish </PERSON> said doctors told her the memory loss was caused by a traumatic event and that her memory may return, either gradually or in a flash.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> renewed on Wednesday his push for a lower capital gains tax, saying it is not `` a tax cut for a few'' but a way to help `` millions'' of Americans find jobs. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> made the pitch at a <ORGANIZATION> Small </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> ceremony honoring minority entrepreneurs. He urged the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> to follow the lead of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and `` cut the capital gains tax now.'' It is not `` a tax cut for a few but ... a tax cut for all, a way to channel investment back into new growth and new jobs,'' said the president. The major beneficiaries will not be the rich but people `` looking for their first job or perhaps their second job,'' said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` It is a job-oriented tax cut.'' The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> last week voted to cut the capital gains tax, now 28 percent to 33 percent, to 19.6 percent for two years and then provide inflation indexing for new assets subject to the levy. Congressional tax experts have said 80 percent of the benefits would go to people with incomes over $ 100,000 a year. It would boost federal revenues in the next three years by $ 9 billion, but lose $ 21 billion over 10 years, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Taxation. But <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> disputes those estimates, arguing that by freeing money for investments, a lower capital gains tax would spur economic growth and generate more tax revenues. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the measure will `` raise employment and raise millions of our fellow Americans to a new threshold of opportunity.'' `` The business of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is not businss; the true business is opportunity,'' he told 150 people at the gathering in the Old Executive Office Building. No government program `` can match the opportunity created for all Americans by those special people that we call entrepreneurs.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> drew loud applause by promising `` to restore and reinvigorate the vision behind the <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Minority </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprise </ORGANIZATION>.'' Commerce Secretary <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mosbacher </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> SBA </ORGANIZATION> Administrator <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Engeleiter </PERSON> joined <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in presenting awards to: _ <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, head of <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Railroad </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Equipment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, as Minority Entrepreneur of the Year His company has grouwn fivefold in seven years and now employs 300 people. _ <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON> <PERSON> McBride </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Albuquerque </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.M. </LOCATION>, as <ORGANIZATION> SBA </ORGANIZATION> Minority Small Business Person of the Year Her retail consumer electronics business, <ORGANIZATION> McBride </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Micro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Source </ORGANIZATION>, has sales of $ 8.6 million a year. _ <PERSON> Roy </PERSON> and <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> of Terry Manufacturing of <LOCATION> Roanoke </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, as the Graduate of the Year from the <ORGANIZATION> SBA </ORGANIZATION>'s 8a program to help minority-owned firms get off the ground <PERSON> Terry </PERSON>, one of three national uniform suppliers for <ORGANIZATION> McDonald </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION>, employs nearly 300 people and has sales exceeding $ 12 million.

<HEAD>Soviets Buying More Soybean Meal, Corn</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has bought 100,000 metric tons of soybean meal and an additional 200,000 tons of corn for delivery in 1989-90 under a long-term supply agreement, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday. The meal and corn were on top of an order for 2 million tons of corn announced Tuesday. The seventh year of the long-term agreement between the two countries began Oct. 1. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> grain sales to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in 1988-89, the sixth year of the agreement, were a record of more than 21.7 million tons, including more than 16.3 million tons of corn and nearly 5.4 million tons of wheat. In addition, the 1988-89 sales included 442,500 tons of soybeans, 1.35 million tons of soybean meal and 1.02 million tons of grain sorghums. A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 39.4 bushels of corn or 36.7 bushels of wheat or soybeans. The 200,000 tons of corn would be about 7.88 million bushels. The new sales were made by unidentified private exporting companies, which are required to report large sales to the department. No selling prices or further details were released. Corn prices have been averaging about $ 2.22 per bushel at the farm, according to <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s five-day average, meaning that the latest sale could have a farm value of around $ 17.5 million. Soybean meal has been selling at wholesale in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> at an equivalent of around $ 220 per metric ton. That would make the latest Soviet purchase worth around $ 22 million at the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> plant.

<HEAD>Bush Urges Mobutu to Settle Difference with Angola's Rebel Leader</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Wednesday urged <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION>'s President <PERSON> Mobutu </PERSON> <PERSON> Sese </PERSON> <PERSON> Seko </PERSON> to settle his differences with Angolan rebel leader <PERSON> Jonas </PERSON> <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> amid reports that <PERSON> Mobutu </PERSON> has disrupted the flow of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arms to <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON>'s guerrillas <PERSON> Mobutu </PERSON> was summoned to the White House from <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to discuss the deterioration in his relations with <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> and the faltering June cease-fire which <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION> mediated between the rebels and <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>'s Soviet-backed government, who have been fighting for 14 years. <PERSON> Mobutu </PERSON>, <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>'s foreign minister, <PERSON> Pedro </PERSON> <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunem </PERSON>, were all in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Wednesday, but none of them met. <PERSON> Mobutu </PERSON> returned to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> where he addressed the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday afternoon. During <PERSON> Mobutu </PERSON>'s speech at the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> guards hustled six people out of the visitors' gallery after they shouted `` Murderer'' at him <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON>, who leads the Union for the Total Independence of <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-, is to meet with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Thursday. During <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s 30-minute meeting with <PERSON> Mobutu </PERSON>, `` The president reiterated the strong <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> support for <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> and our appreciation of President <PERSON> Mobutu </PERSON>'s efforts to try to help bring about national reconciliation in <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>,'' said <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>. `` The president urged President <PERSON> Mobutu </PERSON> to work out any differences which he might have with <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> so that the goal of national reconciliation can be met,'' he said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> will also `` urge him -LRB- <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> -RRB- to work with <PERSON> Mobutu </PERSON> and all the parties involved.'' The problem is that <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> and the Angolan government have differing views of what reconciliation means. The sides have refused to sit in the same room. Instead, they have used <PERSON> Mobutu </PERSON>, other African leaders and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> as go-betweens. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunem </PERSON>, who came to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> for one day Wednesday to counter <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON>'s visit, told reporters his government wants <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> to step down and to integrate his forces into the Angolan armed forces. Once that happens and the civil war ends, multiparty elections can be discussed, he said. `` A multiparty system now is unthinkable,'' he said. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunem </PERSON> contended that <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> agreed to go into temporary exile during a closed-door meeting in June with Angolan President <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> dos </PERSON> <PERSON> Santos </PERSON> held in <LOCATION> Gbadolite </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION>, the same place where they openly agreed to a cease-fire. However, <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> denied the claim during a news conference, saying, `` If there was a secret agreement, it was a secret to me too.'' He said the first step for <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> must be free elections that would give <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> a role in running the country. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunem </PERSON> accused <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> of reneging on the <LOCATION> Gbadolite </LOCATION> agreements, saying <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> had come to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to ask for more weapons to augment an estimated $ 40 million in arms he already gets annually. He said <PERSON> Mobutu </PERSON>, the main channel for American arms supplies to <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON>, told the Angolan government he had stopped shipping <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> weapons to <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> before the June accords. On Tuesday, Sen. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.C. </LOCATION> complained at a hearing of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> that <PERSON> Mobutu </PERSON> had cut the flow of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> arms to <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON>'s forces, but neither <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> nor <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> would discuss the matter. <PERSON> Mobutu </PERSON> did not talk to the news media during his brief visit to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. During his previous visit to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> in June, <PERSON> Mobutu </PERSON> told administration officials that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid to <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> and Soviet aid to the Angolan government should both stop to give the <LOCATION> Gbadolite </LOCATION> agreements a chance to work. But the truce agreement collapsed soon after it was signed, and <PERSON> Mobutu </PERSON> has been siding with the Angolan government which demanded that <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> step down. <PERSON> Mobutu </PERSON> has promised to ask <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> to sign a commitment of temporary exile before an upcoming summit of African leaders in <LOCATION> Gabon </LOCATION>, <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunem </PERSON> said. He urged the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration to support the <LOCATION> Gbadolite </LOCATION> accords as interpreted by <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Mobutu </PERSON> and other African leaders _ that <PERSON> Savimbi </PERSON> go into exile _ saying he planned to press his case with Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> has agreed to meet with <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunem </PERSON> although the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> have no diplomatic relations. <PERSON> Van </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunem </PERSON> also accused the administration of reneging on a promise by former Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would establish diplomatic links with the Angolan government once <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> agreed to the withdrawal of the 50,000 Cuban troops stationed there. The Cuban pullout was agreed to in a U.S.-sponsored agreement signed last December and about half have left thus far. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has denied such a promise was made, saying the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would withhold official recognition of <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> until national reconciliation with <ORGANIZATION> UNITA </ORGANIZATION> is achieved.

<DATELINE>JERUSALEM (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers fired on masked Palestinians in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> on Wednesday, killing two and wounding others, the army said. Arab reporters said some soldiers were disguised as laborers and drove a private car. The army spokesman's office said the soldiers were in uniform. Also Wednesday, three Palestinians suspected of collaborating with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> were reported killed by fellow Arabs. The army confirmed two of the deaths, one in an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> prison camp, and said it was checking further. Sixteen Palestinians in all were reported wounded by <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> gunfire in the occupied territories Wednesday. Arab reporters in the <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> said soldiers, operating under cover, came upon a gang of masked Palestinian youths in <LOCATION> Bureij </LOCATION> refugee camp and fired. Residents of Bureij identified the dead as <PERSON> Mahmoud </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamala </PERSON>, 22, and <PERSON> Maher </PERSON> <PERSON> Mohammed </PERSON> <PERSON> Al-Makadma </PERSON>, 18, raising to 583 the number of Palestinians killed by Israelis since the uprising began in the occupied <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> 21 months ago. Forty Israelis also have died. In addition, 126 Palestinians were killed by fellow Arabs. New army firing orders allow soldiers to fire live ammunition at masked Palestinians after shouting a warning and firing in the air. If warnings go unheeded, soldiers can fire at suspects' legs. Earlier, troops could fire at masked men only if the men were armed. In politics, Foreign Minister <PERSON> Moshe </PERSON> <PERSON> Arens </PERSON> said he expected Prime Minster <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s President <PERSON> Hosni </PERSON> <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON> to hold a long-awaited first summit. He said no date was set. His comment preceded a crucial government meeting on <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace prospects. The two divided parties in the coalition <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> met separately to outline their strategies for a session of the inner Cabinet Thursday on <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>'s offer to arrange an Israeli-Palestinian meeting in <LOCATION> Cairo </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials urge acceptance of <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>'s efforts as a way to further <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s own plan for <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> peace, including elections in the occupied territories taken from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s left-leaning <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> accepts <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>'s proposal. But after senior ministers in <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON>'s right-wing <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> bloc met Wednesday, officials said <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> stood by its rejection of <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>'s main ideas <ORGANIZATION> Likud </ORGANIZATION> rejects <PERSON> Mubarak </PERSON>'s call for <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> to accept the U.S.-backed formula of trading occupied land for peace. Labor, which arranged to meet Wednesday night in <LOCATION> Tel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Aviv </LOCATION>, supports land-for-peace and talking to Palestinians outside the occupied territories. Industry Minister <PERSON> Ariel </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> urged Wednesday that at least 300 more Jewish families move into the Moslem quarter of <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio reported <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON>, who owns a house in the quarter, made the comment at a ceremony opening a `` security center'' for self-protection by the 30 Jewish families living there. <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON>'s house is under 24-hour police guard. The <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> is part of the territory <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> captured from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> in 1967.

<HEAD>Six Officers Indicted in Dealer's Beating Death</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MIAMI (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Six members of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>'s street narcotics unit were indicted Wednesday on charges they allegedly chased down a drug dealer and beat him to death after an anonymous tip indicated he had a murder contract on one of them. The federal indictment charged the officers with civil rights violations resulting in the Dec. 16 death of <PERSON> Leonardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Mercado </PERSON>. Two of the officers also were accused of beating Mercado about six weeks before the fatal attack. And all six were charged with attacking <PERSON> Mercado </PERSON>'s stepson, <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Soto </PERSON>, on the night of the killing. State Attorney <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> Reno </PERSON> would not respond when asked if her department was pursuing state charges. A federal magistrate ordered the six officers, who were relieved of duty after <PERSON> Mercado </PERSON>'s death, to post $ 200,000 personal surety bond and appear for arraignment Oct. 16. The six entered court manacled to each other amid applause from relatives and friends outside. If convicted, each faces life imprisonment and a $ 750,000 fine. `` It's a sad day when a federal grand jury must indict six police officers for intentional use of unreasonable force,'' said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Dexter </PERSON> <PERSON> Lehtinen </PERSON>. `` This case reminds us that everyone _ president, police officers, the average citizen _ is subject to the law and will be prosecuted for deliberate violations of the law,'' he said. <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> police cooperated with the federal investigation and expected the indictment. `` We're saddened by the experience, but we must go out and perform our duties in a professional manner and continue to serve the community,'' said Police Chief <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>. The indictment alleges that about six weeks before the fatal attack, officers <PERSON> Pablo </PERSON> <PERSON> Camacho </PERSON> and <PERSON> Andy </PERSON> <PERSON> Watson </PERSON> beat <PERSON> Mercado </PERSON>, 35, at a game room near his apartment. It then alleges that all six officers were on their way to a drug sting on Dec. 16 when they allegedly detoured to <PERSON> Mercado </PERSON>'s apartment and attacked him and his stepson. <PERSON> Mercado </PERSON> died hours later. Reports had been circulating around the department for a few days that an anonymous tip indicated <PERSON> Mercado </PERSON> had targeted <PERSON> Camacho </PERSON> for murder. All six officers were charged with conspiracy to threaten and intimidate <PERSON> Mercado </PERSON> by use of unreasonable force under color of law and civil rights violations in the death of Mercado and the attack on <PERSON> Soto </PERSON>. <PERSON> Camacho </PERSON> and <PERSON> Watson </PERSON> were charged with a civil rights violation in the November beating of <LOCATION> Mercado </LOCATION>. The officers charged and their experience with the department are: <PERSON> Camacho </PERSON>, 42, 13 years; <PERSON> Charlie </PERSON> <PERSON> Haynes </PERSON>, 30, 10 years; <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinclair </PERSON>, 46, seven years; <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Trujillo </PERSON>, 31, nine years; <PERSON> Nathaniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Veal </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, 31, eight years; and <PERSON> Watson </PERSON>, 32, nine years. The indictment of the six officers is the second scandal within the <ORGANIZATION> Miami </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> department in five years. A band of 15 officers was charged with running a drug-ripoff ring that was blamed for the drownings of three drug boat guards in 1985.

Officials hoped to open the <LOCATION> Ben </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sawyer </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bridge </LOCATION> to traffic by Thursday, giving residents of the Isle of Palms and <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>'s Island land access to their homes for the first time since the killer storm struck on Sept. 21 <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON>'s 135-mph wind wrenched the 500,000-ton swing bridge, leaving it tipped at a 45-degree angle, leaning on its center support pier with one end submerged in the water. The bridge was lifted out of the water by a crane mounted on a barge. Highway officials said they would inspect the bridge before declaring it safe for traffic. Since the storm, the only access to the islands has been by boat or helicopter. Dozens of spectators watched the bridge operation in small boats stopped in the waterway. Others watched from the shoreline at the <PERSON> Toler </PERSON>'s Cover marina and condominium complex, where the storm ripped the roofs off some units and tossed boats around the parking lot. Among them was <PERSON> Melvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderegg </PERSON>, mayor of <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>'s Island. Residents were again living on the island and power and water has been restored, although the water has not yet been approved for drinking, he said. `` The people want to get back to their homes and get started digging out,'' <PERSON> Anderegg </PERSON> said. `` Everywhere you look over there are people cleaning up and moving things.'' The mayor estimated that between 100 and 150 of the approximately 850 houses on the island are not habitable. Many of them are rental and vacation homes. The <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carolina </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said about two-thirds of the utility's 158,000 customers in the metropolitan <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> area had power restored by late Tuesday. Power was restored by Wednesday to almost all customers in other areas of the state, power company officials said. Hurricane Hugo slammed into the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> coast Sept. 21, killing at least 18 and damaging and destroying homes, businesses, schools and municipal buildings as far inland as <LOCATION> Sumter </LOCATION> and north to <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>. In all, 29 people were killed on the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> mainland. Damage in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> has been estimated at $ 3 billion or more. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Emergency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> opened two additional disaster assistance centers Wednesday in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, making a total of 16 centers where people can apply for emergency grants and loans. In addition, it is now operating a telephone hotline and applications may be submitted over the phone, said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Hall </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> FEMA </ORGANIZATION>'s coordinating officer for the hurricane recovery. The <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION> announced Wednesday that only seven storm evacuation shelters housing 454 people remain open around the state, down from 10 shelters Tuesday. Since the storm approached, 453 shelters have housed 87,230 people. Even while the cleanup continued, officials urged visitors to return to historic <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION>. `` We plan to go to every city in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> that sent aid to <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> and go on their media and thank them and tell them <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> is open for business,'' said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Blazer </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Charleston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trident </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chamber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>. Ninety percent of the area's hotels and restaurants should be open by mid-October. The tourism industry is worth $ 4.9 billion to the local economy, <PERSON> Blazer </PERSON> said. Mayor <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Riley </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> also urged visitors to return. `` We've bounced back from Hurricane Hugo and visitors should not cancel their plans to come to <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> but should come right ahead,'' the mayor said. A 9 p.m. to 5 a.m. curfew should be lifted soon. Meanwhile, a coalition of <LOCATION> Charleston </LOCATION> area groups announced plans to begin replacing millions of acres of trees devastated by <PERSON> Hugo </PERSON>. The effort, dubbed Lowcountry Releaf, will collect funds to buy seedlings and distribute trees between Thanksgiving and Arbor Day, Dec. 1.

 Cypriot President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Vassiliou </PERSON> conferred with President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Wednesday and said he is willing to demilitarize <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> if <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> withdraws its troops from the island. <PERSON> Vassiliou </PERSON> met in the Oval Office with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, Secretary of State <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>, national security adviser Brent Scowcroft and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s special <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> negotiator, <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Ledsky </PERSON>. White House Press Secretary <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said afterwards that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> reaffirmed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> support for <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> efforts to negotiate a solution to the <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> problem. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` expressed his hope that the talks will be resumed at the earliest possible date,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Vassiliou </PERSON>, speaking with reporters on the White House driveway, called it `` an extremely good meeting. ... I'm extremely satisfied.'' He said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` made it quite clear ... that he does not consider the status quo as a solution.'' <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> invaded <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> in 1974 and in 1983 Turkish Cypriots declared a breakaway republic in their third of the eastern <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> island. <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> still has 30,000 troops on the island, where <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping forces help keep the peace between the majority Greek Cypriots and the Turkish minority. <PERSON> Vassiliou </PERSON> said his government has been building up its military for defensive purposes, but he insisted its army of 10,000 to 12,000 conscripts is no match for the Turkish forces. He repeated a challenge first delivered earlier in the day in a speech to the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` I challenge the Turkish government. If they're really worried about our building up our defenses, let's demilitarize. We are ready to do that any moment,'' he said. `` Let's start: they withdraw their armies, we dismantle our army and also give away all our guns, and let's have <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> demilitarized under any kind of guarantees.'' <PERSON> Vassiliou </PERSON> called upon leaders of <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION> and the Turkish Cypriots to `` stop making difficulties and sit down and talk. `` I would like to give this message to the <LOCATION> Turkish </LOCATION> people: It's an anachronism to have the <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> issue open It helps nobody. It causes pain to all of us. And it costs a lot of money that we could use much better for the benefit of our people. `` <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> with its problems would be a good friend of <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>, would be a place where Turkish Cypriots and <LOCATION> Greek </LOCATION> Cypriots would feel happy and will contriute significantly to peace in the region,'' he said. He said the impoverished Turkish Cypriot community had the most to gain from a solution. <PERSON> Vassiliou </PERSON> gave <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> a gift of an ancient vase from <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, dating to 600 B.C. `` Six hundred B.C.!'' exclaimed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, displaying the heirloom for cameras. `` Six hundred B.C., yes,'' said <PERSON> Vassiliou </PERSON>, joking, `` It's maybe 580 or 620.'' `` It looks like about 590 B.C.,'' cracked <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 A coalition of citizens' groups sought a court order Wednesday to delay the scheduled Oct. 12 launch of a nuclear-powered probe from the space shuttle. The danger of plutonium contamination from a shuttle disaster is far greater than the government has admitted, the <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coalition </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> and two other organizations said in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. The groups, which filed suit Sept. 28, made formal requests for a temporary restraining order and a preliminary injunction to stop the launch of the Shuttle Atlantis which is to carry the <ORGANIZATION> Galileo </ORGANIZATION> probe into space. In a 37-page court brief, the groups said a number of scientists are counseling against making the launch. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuddihy </PERSON>, a leading expert on radiation poisoning, wrote the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> last month, saying the launch puts large numbers of people at risk, the court papers said. <PERSON> Cuddihy </PERSON> also is a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Interagency </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Review </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Panel </ORGANIZATION> which is composed of representatives of <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Cuddihy </PERSON> estimated the cost in human lives and cleanup of a <ORGANIZATION> Galileo </ORGANIZATION> explosion would be many times higher than that admitted by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. He recommended that these types of missions be launched on unmanned rockets from remote locations. The court filing also said that: _ <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Weatherwax </PERSON>, a leading authority on the dangers of the space shuttle, has called the Galileo launch irresponsible. He estimates the possibilities of an accident and a deadly plutonium release from <ORGANIZATION> Galileo </ORGANIZATION> are 1-in-350. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> says the highest probability of launch area release of plutonium due to a shuttle accident is less than 1-in-2 ,500 _ <PERSON> Horst </PERSON> <PERSON> Poehler </PERSON>, a longtime consultant for <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> contractors, has challenged the risk assessments of <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Poehler </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> has not made public for comment the assumptions and details of the agency's calculations for nuclear release or individual per person doses of radiation for various types of accidents Once in orbit, <ORGANIZATION> Galileo </ORGANIZATION> is to rocket itself on a round-about voyage to <LOCATION> Jupiter </LOCATION>. Powering the craft are two radioisotope thermoelectric generators. Each of the RTGs are energized by 24.7 pounds of plutonium-238. The suit said the Galileo project will condemn thousands of eastern <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> residents `` to a wholly unnecessary and virtual certainty of contracting cancer'' if a shuttle launch accident, similar to the one that destroyed Challenger in 1986, caused the plutonium to be vaporized and spread over the area. Joining the filing of the suit were the Foundation on Economic Trends and the <ORGANIZATION> Christic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Eds: UPDATES throughout with refugees leaving the U.S. Embassy, diplomats
saying East Berlin promises to look favorably on their requests to leave.

 Eighteen East Germans who occupied the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in an effort to flee to the West left the compound late Wednesday with assurances their government will look favorably on their emigration requests, diplomats said. Earlier in the day, East German police cordoned off the embassy in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> and scuffled with about 50 other refugees also hoping to gain sanctuary there. Elsewhere, thousands of other East Germans lined railroad tracks with packed bags and children in tow, hoping to jump aboard trains carrying their countrymen to the West from <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>, witnesses said. The trains were to pass through <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> on their way to Hof, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> reluctantly agreed to allow the exodus, the second in the last four days, after thousands of its citizens flooded embassies in <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. Wednesday's scuffle in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> came a day after the 18 East Germans moved into the embassy and refused to leave until they were given permission to emigrate from their Communist homeland. According to a statement from the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>, those 18 agreed to leave the mission Wednesday night and went home. East German officials have promised to `` examine ... with goodwill'' their emigration applications, the statement said. Western diplomats in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> said they assume the group will soon be permitted to leave for <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, though it was not clear if East German authorities explicitly made such a promise. After agreeing to the latest rail exodus, the hard-line <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> government on Tuesday closed its border with <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>. That is the only country where East Germans could freely travel without government permission. That closure and the sanctioned exodus from <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> has triggered a flood of other East Germans desperately trying to take part in the mass transfer. Witnesses said about 100 East German police scuffled with about 50 would-be emigres in front of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION>, preventing their entry. There were no reports of injuries. Western reporters saw at least 12 people taken away in police vans, among them a young mother and three wailing children. The embassy was circled by police, and passers-by were checked for documents and told to leave the area. On the corner of the nearby central thoroughfare, <PERSON> Unter </PERSON> <PERSON> den </PERSON> <PERSON> Linden </PERSON>, scores of onlookers gathered to watch. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Verner </PERSON> said the 18 East Germans _ 10 adults and eight children _ were holed up in the embassy since late Tuesday. Before leaving, the refugees were staying in a cramped room just off the embassy entrance lobby. They were mostly couples in their 20s and many had small children and babies in strollers and baskets. `` This is our last hope,'' one refugee had said. `` We're not going to budge until we know we'll be able to leave.'' Diplomatic sources, also speaking on condition of anonymity, said four East German refugees fled to the West German diplomatic mission in <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said of the refugee influx: `` We're talking to the East Germans about it and trying to get them to help resolve the problem through their immigration policies.'' Hungarian and West German media reported that thousands more had crowded other spots along the route the trains are taking through <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>. Many had their belongings packed and were hoping to jump on the trains, as many did during last weekend's exodus. In <LOCATION> Dresden </LOCATION>, witnesses said police used truncheons to clear about 5,000 East Germans from the city's central station who gathered since Tuesday in hopes of climbing on the western-bound trains. After being forced out of the station, witnesses said more then 5,000 people stretched in a line along the tracks. The crowd dispersed by early Wednesday after learning the trains from <LOCATION> Prague </LOCATION> were delayed. During last weekend's exodus of about 7,000 East Germans, several managed to board a train in <LOCATION> Dresden </LOCATION> as it passed. Police officials in the West German border town of <LOCATION> Hof </LOCATION>, where the refugees were to arrive, said about 1,000 young East Germans were waiting along the tracks near <LOCATION> Plauen </LOCATION>, an East German town near the Czechoslovak border. The embarassing exodus comes as East German plans a weekend celebration of its 40th anniversary, to be attended by Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 A Cypriot oil tanker leaked about 350 barrels of oil into the <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> that on Wednesday had formed a slick 14 miles long off southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, news agencies reported. The independent South African Press Association quoted Capt. P.H. Kroon of the <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s marine division as saying a strong southerly current would keep the slick away from the coast. It quoted R.C. <PERSON> van </PERSON> <PERSON> der </PERSON> <PERSON> Krol </PERSON>, port captain of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, as saying the tanker Pacificos spilled the oil about 25 miles south of <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and that he did not know the ship's port of origin or its destination. Government television said the oil was leaking from a 50-foot gash just above the water line in the midsection of the 26,800-ton tanker, but did not say how or when the damage occurred. It said the captain notified authorities Wednesday afternoon and a <ORGANIZATION> coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> guard </ORGANIZATION> plane flew over the slick, which the television said was three miles wide at some points. <ORGANIZATION> SAPA </ORGANIZATION> quoted a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Pentow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION> salvage company, as saying a <ORGANIZATION> coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> guard </ORGANIZATION> anti-pollution vessel was in the vicinity and another was on its way. The spokesman, not identified, said the tanker was carrying 10,000 tons of oil and that a salvage tug was to reach it by Thursday afternoon.

<HEAD>Florida Blood Bank To Begin Reporting AIDS Carriers</HEAD>
<HEAD>With AM-AIDS-Blood, Bjt</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TAMPA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A blood bank plans to start reporting the names of AIDS carriers to health authorities who in turn will try to trace the patient's sexual contacts, officials said. `` We do n't want people with AIDS or people at high risk for AIDS donating blood,'' said <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Wiebeck </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Florida </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Blood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's not right, it's not safe. The safety of the public is of primary importance.'' Also, the blood bank wants to discourage people from using donations as a way to get a free, confidential AIDS test. `` One of our fears is that people may be donating blood to get a confidential test for AIDS,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmidt </PERSON>, director of the blood bank and a recent past president of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Blood </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banks </ORGANIZATION>. A spokesman for AIDS patients advised caution in reporting names. `` Passing along names would scare people,'' said <PERSON> Chuck </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuehn </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Tampa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AIDS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>. `` They would have achieved their purpose but I do n't agree with their tactics.'' The <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> blood bank is considered among the most aggressive in the country in trying to prevent AIDS carriers from donating blood. In March 1988, the bank became one of two in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to start interviewing donors to identify high-risk applicants. A <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bernardino </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, blood bank was the other. Donors will be told of the policy and asked to sign a form acknowledging they were so advised. If tests show young donors, 17 or 18, carry the human immunodeficiency virus, or HIV, which causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome, the blood bank will notify their parents or guardian. Dr. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Kwalick </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Hillsborough </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, said his employees intend to follow the same procedures they use in tracing contacts of patients with other sexually transmitted diseases. Names from the blood bank would be used as one source of information in tracing contacts. He said recently passed laws let the department include AIDS patients in the tracing, but that state Health and Rehabilitative Services officials have to give their permission. The Health Department offers anonymous and confidential AIDS testing. The blood bank has been identifying between one and two donors that test positive for the AIDS virus for every 10,000 units of blood donated. That is about what would be expected nationally, <PERSON> Wiebeck </PERSON> said. In the interview process, potential donors are asked a series of questions instead of simply being asked to complete a form saying they do not fall into high-risk categories. The Tampa data showed 62 donors out of the approximately 36,000 seen since the questioning began were `` deferred'' because they gave a positive response to a question.

<HEAD>State School Board Approves Jersey City Takeover</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A state superintendent took control of <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'s faltering public schools Wednesday, completing a five-year legal struggle that ended in the nation's largest state takeover of an urban school district. <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> students have been subjected to `` educational child abuse,'' said Gov. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kean </PERSON>. `` Now the community can put politics and patronage aside, and get on with the business of learning.'' The state had cited political intrusion in hiring practices, poor test scores, failure to provide a safe, clean environment for students, violations of bidding laws, failure to provide for handicapped children and unauthorized use of state funds as some of the reasons for the takeover. On Wednesday, the state <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Jamesburg </LOCATION> gave final approval to the takeover and formally appointed <PERSON> Elena </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Scambio </PERSON> to a three-year term as superintendent of the school district. Ms. <PERSON> Scambio </PERSON>'s first act was to abolish the jobs of seven top administrators in the district, including that of school Superintendent <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>. The state board's action also officially disbanded the <ORGANIZATION> Jersey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION>. A new board is expected to be appointed by state Education Commissioner <PERSON> Saul </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooperman </PERSON> by December. Ms. <PERSON> Scambio </PERSON>, a former <LOCATION> Essex </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> school superintendent who has been preparing for the transition since August, promised to `` unravel the quagmire that exists in <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>'' and make the city a national model of urban education. Under <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>'s takeover law, the state has five years to make improvements. National education groups say they will closely monitor the progress of the takeover. The move gives the state extraordinary powers in <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, the state's second largest district with 28,000 students. Ms. <PERSON> Scambio </PERSON> said other immediate changes may include trimming from 100 to 150 staff positions, streamlined management, physical improvements to schools and better community relations. The <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> school system has a staff of 3,322 and a budget for the current year of about $ 180 million. Enrollment is 44 percent black, 34 percent Hispanic and 13 percent white. The board's decision was expected and ends a bitter legal battle by the state to take over the schools, a process strongly pushed by <PERSON> Kean </PERSON>, who has billed himself as `` the education governor.'' State board Vice President <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Woodruff </PERSON>, reading a resolution, said `` the district's problems were deep-rooted and endemic. The <ORGANIZATION> Jersey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> board of education totally failed to meet its obligations.'' This summer, Administrative Law Judge <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> Springer </PERSON> agreed with the argument of state officials in his decision to grant the state power to take over the district. <PERSON> Springer </PERSON> noted that some textbooks used in <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> classrooms are more than 30 years old. <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> officials bitterly fought the takeover effort, saying the problems were caused by a prior administration and that the state trumped up its case against the district. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, who was relieved as school superintendent but can still teach in the district, released a statement Wednesday criticizing the takeover effort. `` In a society that offers little enough to bolster the self-confidence of urban children, the campaign to take over the <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> schools has only further lowered the self-image of our students,'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said test scores have climbed in recent years, and one of the district's high schools was one of only five in the state with a 100 percent passing rate on the high school proficiency test. Local officials had at first sought to rally public opinion against the intervention but found little political support. Former Mayor <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuccio </PERSON>, who opposed the takeover, lost his seat in May to <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> McCann </PERSON>, who said he would not oppose the move. `` It should have happened much sooner, I think,'' said <PERSON> Samir </PERSON> <PERSON> Skular </PERSON>, 31, a 31-year-old city resident with two daughters in the public schools. `` It was just politicians trying to protect their jobs and not thinking about kids.'' <PERSON> Jean </PERSON> <PERSON> McDonald </PERSON>, a researcher for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governors </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, said <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> have laws allowing state takeovers of failing school districts In <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION>, the state school board has taken limited control of three county districts under an `` academic bankruptcy'' law enacted by the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> in 1988.

 Heckled by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, Lebanese legislators met on Wednesday and debated scrapping a 46-year-old pact that divides government jobs along sectarian lines. They agreed earlier to revamp Parliament with an equal number of Moslems and Christians in an effort to end the 14-year-old civil war. Any agreement, however, must win the support of powerful warlords who have controlled much of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> since fighting began in 1975. Moslem militia leaders <PERSON> Nabih </PERSON> <PERSON> Berri </PERSON> and <PERSON> Walid </PERSON> <PERSON> Jumblatt </PERSON> reportedly gave negative assessments of the Taif efforts on Wednesday. Militia leaders have been kept away from the meeting. The conflict is a battleground for conflicting Arab interests as well as for Lebanese factions. The war has killed at least 150,000 people and turned much of the capital, <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, into rubble. Iranian President <PERSON> Hashemi </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> warned the legislators Wednesday not to surrender to domination by Maronite Catholics. `` If they give in, they have done a great treason to the <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> people, and should be seriously confronted,'' the <ORGANIZATION> Islamic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON> as saying. Iranian Foreign Minister <PERSON> Ali </PERSON> <PERSON> Akbar </PERSON> <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> earlier Wednesday rejected decisions taken by the legislators on grounds they failed to hand over the bulk of political power to Moslems. In <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, two foreign passenger jets _ an <ORGANIZATION> Aeroflot </ORGANIZATION> flight from <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and a French airliner _ landed at the airport Wednesday, the first since the airport reopened nearly two weeks ago after a cease-fire that ended six months of shelling duels between Moslem and <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> militias. Thirty-three Christian and 30 Moslem legislators, representing all but 10 of the body's surviving 73 members, met for a fifth day to discuss reforms aimed at ending the war. They agreed Tuesday to expand the 99-seat Parliament and to ensure an equal distribution between Christians and Moslems. The last official census conducted in 1932 showed Christians made up a majority of the population, but later estimates say Moslems make up 55 percent of <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s 4 million people. On Wednesday, the deputies talked of using a merit system to fill government jobs. Sources at the meeting, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said all deputies opposed continuing the present sectarian system but differed on how and when to change it. Some Christian speakers made reform conditional on a withdrawal of Syrian forces from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, the sources said. Saudi Foreign Minister Prince <PERSON> Saud </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Faisal </PERSON> and other mediators met <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> deputies, apparently to try to persuade them to drop this condition. Deputies also discussed possible expansion of the premier's powers at the expense of the president Under an unwritten 1943 national covenant, power was shared by a <ORGANIZATION> Maronite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> president, a Sunni Moslem premier and a <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Moslem </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> speaker, with top government, army and public administration posts going to the Maronites. One Parliament member, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said abolishing political factionalism `` is an issue too explosive for the parliamentarians to handle without the prior consent of the warlords who control the Lebanese arena.'' <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s state-run news agency <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Rafsanjani </PERSON>'s statement came after he met in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> with four Lebanese Moslem leaders: <PERSON> Berri </PERSON>, leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Amal </ORGANIZATION> movement; <PERSON> Jumblatt </PERSON>, the Druse chieftain; <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Subhi </PERSON> <PERSON> Tufaili </PERSON>, a leader of the <ORGANIZATION> Shiite </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hezbollah </ORGANIZATION>, or Party of God; and <PERSON> Sheik </PERSON> <PERSON> Saeed </PERSON> <PERSON> Shaaban </PERSON>, head of a <LOCATION> Syrian </LOCATION> - and Libyan-backed Sunni fundamentalist faction <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> told a news conference in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> `` we can place no hope in the <LOCATION> Taif </LOCATION> meeting,'' Iranian TV reported. `` Since the majority of the <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> people are Moslems, it is natural that the principal rule in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> must be in the hands of Moslems,'' he said. `` If any decision is made at <LOCATION> Taif </LOCATION> or elsewhere that contradicts this basic principle ... it will not be accepted by the Moslem and nationalist forces, and it will be rejected by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Velayati </PERSON> said. The broadcast and <ORGANIZATION> IRNA </ORGANIZATION> dispatch were monitored in <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jumblatt </PERSON> and <PERSON> Berri </PERSON> say Syrian troops are needed to guarantee a settlement. Iranian TV said <PERSON> Amal </PERSON> issued a statement saying the Taif meeting will not reach a just solution to <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s crisis. In <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, the Christian-run <ORGANIZATION> Voice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lebanon </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Jumblatt </PERSON> as saying a cease-fire that began late last month was just an `` intermission'' in the war. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> is a major backer of Shiites in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, who are estimated to be the largest sect there. Supporters of Christian leader Gen. <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Aoun </PERSON>, a Maronite, demand a timetable for a pullout of <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s 40,000 troops from <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> before considering political reforms. If agreement is reached on reforms, the <LOCATION> Lebanese </LOCATION> parliament would convene in <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> to ratify them formally, with a tentative date set at Oct. 21.

 Members of the <ORGANIZATION> Irish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday shot and killed a Roman Catholic after mistaking him for a <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> gunman, police said. The victim, 52-year-old <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Babbington </PERSON>, was shot point-blank by two men outside a primary school, the <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ulster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Constabulary </ORGANIZATION> said. In a statement to local news media, the predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> claimed it killed a gunman who was involved in several attacks against <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> members. The <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> statement gave a name of the purported victim, but it was not <PERSON> Babbington </PERSON>. `` The victim was an entirely innocent man who was on his way to work,'' the Constabulary said in a statement late Wednesday. `` The fact that the shooting appears to have been carried out before the horrified gaze of young children speaks volumes for the sick mentality of the murderers,'' said <PERSON> Alban </PERSON> <PERSON> McGuinness </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. It is the largest predominantly <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> party in the province. Press Association, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s domestic news agency, said the man identified by the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> was taken into protective custody. A Constabulary press officer declined to comment on that report. The outlawed <ORGANIZATION> Ulster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Volunteer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>, an extremist <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> group, claimed responsibility for another shooting Wednesday in north <LOCATION> Belfast </LOCATION>. The victim, who suffered shoulder and leg injuries, was related to a prominent member of <ORGANIZATION> Sinn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fein </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION>'s legal political wing, police said. The <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> is fighting to end British rule in <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION> and unite the 60 percent <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> province with the 95 percent <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Irish </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> Mayor-elect <PERSON> Maynard </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> prepared to trade places for a second time with Mayor <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, while <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Goddard </PERSON> pondered the mixed message contained in his landslide re-election. `` We're ready to roll,'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> said after his own overwhelming victory Tuesday, which made him the city's first three-term black mayor. `` I'm eager to get to it.'' <PERSON> Goddard </PERSON> said he would try to figure out why voters rejected his plans for a downtown baseball stadium even as they returned him to office for a third term. <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION>'s city charter prohibited <PERSON> Young </PERSON>, the former <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> ambassador, from seeking a third consecutive term as mayor, just as it prohibited <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> from seeking a third straight term eight years ago. Young plans to run for governor next year, while <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> will resume leadership at City Hall. He was in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> on Wednesday, but campaign officials said he would announce the members of his transition staff on Thursday. <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> won Tuesday by a nearly 5-1 margin over civil rights activist <PERSON> Hosea </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>. In final, unofficial returns, <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> had 54,897 votes, or 79 percent, to 11,1116, or 16.5 percent, for <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>. Four other candidates shared 4.5 percent of the vote. <PERSON> Goddard </PERSON> beat his nearest rival in <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>, state <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Burton </PERSON> <PERSON> Kruglick </PERSON>, by nearly a 2-to-1 margin, while voters spurned the proposed baseball stadium by a 3-to-2 margin. It was the latest in a series of rejections for large public works projects that <PERSON> Goddard </PERSON> has supported. <PERSON> Goddard </PERSON> conceded that he was responsible for selling his projects to the public. `` Obviously, we have n't done that,'' he said. The <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> elections were among several Tuesday. Among the others: _ In <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, a Democratic state senator and a Republican political aide are gearing up for an Oct. 17 runoff in their race to fill the seat left vacant by the late Rep. <PERSON> Larkin </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, who died in a plane crash. Democrat <PERSON> Gene </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> claimed 42 percent of the vote Tuesday and Republican <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> received 37 percent to win spots in the runoff. State Attorney General <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> trailed with 21 percent. _ <LOCATION> Albuquerque </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.M. </LOCATION>, Mayor <PERSON> Ken </PERSON> <PERSON> Schultz </PERSON> was turned out of office, prompting one of the candidates who beat him, <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Saavedra </PERSON>, to say that voters `` are fed up with all the politics that go on at City Hall.'' <PERSON> Schultz </PERSON> received just 10 percent of the vote in his defeat at the hands of <PERSON> Saavedra </PERSON> and <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Baca </PERSON>, who will face each other in a runoff that must be held within 30 days. No mayor has been elected to back-to-back terms since <LOCATION> Albuquerque </LOCATION> enacted a mayor-council form of government in 1974. _ <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> voters will elect the city's second black mayor on Nov. 7 after City Council President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Forbes </PERSON> and his youthful former protege, state Sen. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, defeated three rivals to advance to a runoff. _ In <LOCATION> Escondido </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, pro-choice advocate <PERSON> Tricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Hunter </PERSON> won a vacant state Assembly seat by defeating a Democratic opponent and turning back a strong write-in campaign by an anti-abortion advocate she beat in the Republican primary.

 A woman who fatally stabbed her two young daughters, then forced her 8-year-old son to kill her with the same knife had threatened last month to poison all four of her children, a social services lawyer said Wednesday. The allegation came to light in a Juvenile Court custody hearing the day after <PERSON> Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> killed her 3 - and 4-year-old daughters with a 10-inch kitchen knife and ordered her son to stab her, investigators said The woman's husband, <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON>, called the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rehabilitative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> last month, saying she had threatened to poison all four children, said <PERSON> Pablo </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON>, a department lawyer. Mrs. <PERSON> King </PERSON>, 32, denied the threat when confronted by social workers, <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> then refused state services, saying he needed his wife at home to take care of the children while he worked, said <PERSON> Ruben </PERSON> <PERSON> Betancourt </PERSON>, a spokesman for the department. The department's investigation remained open, and <PERSON> Betancourt </PERSON> said agency procedures were followed. `` We started an investigation at the father's request on the accusation that the mother was threatening the children. We went and talked to the mother, talked to the father, talked to the children, who were happy, well-fed,'' <PERSON> Betancourt </PERSON> said. Neighbors said Mrs. <PERSON> King </PERSON> rarely left the two-bedroom house since the family moved in a few months ago. Her husband attended two neighborhood Crime Watch meetings, and the children frequently were seen playing outside. Judge <PERSON> Seymour </PERSON> <PERSON> Gelber </PERSON> said the agency's handling of the matter was appropriate. `` It appears HRS did what it should have done,'' he said. `` So this was not a case where HRS failed to follow up.'' The state agency went to court Wednesday for custody of the 8-year-old and his 6-year-old brother after the father refused to allow medical and psychological evaluations of the boys, <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> said. The judge granted the agency custody, and the boys were placed in a temporary state shelter, <PERSON> Betancourt </PERSON> said.

 A jury Wednesday began deliberating the fraud and conspiracy charges against <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> founder <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> and must decide if he is the `` world-class'' con man prosecutors contend, or the victim of circumstance his lawyers say. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> is accused of diverting more than $ 3.7 million in <ORGANIZATION> PTL </ORGANIZATION> money to live in high style, buying Rolls-Royces, lavish homes, raw diamonds, an air-conditioned doghouse and furnishings ranging from mirrored walls and gold-plated swan bathroom fixtures to motorized bedroom drapes and gigantic walk-in closets. `` I feel fine,'' <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> said as he and his wife, <PERSON> Tammy </PERSON> <PERSON> Faye </PERSON>, left the federal courthouse. Asked if he was worried about the outcome, <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> responded, `` No I'm trusting God.'' `` Last night, we had a great dinner together,'' he said. `` We slept like babies,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> added. The jury returned to the courtroom several times after getting the case Wednesday morning. One of the jurors' requests was for evidence relating to wire fraud charges. The jury also asked <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Potter </PERSON> for clarification of a charge, two boxes of government exhibits and an explanation of federal statutes relating to mail and wire fraud and conspiracy. The jury recessed its deliberations at 6 p.m. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>, 49, is charged in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> with 15 counts of wire fraud, eight counts of mail fraud and one count of conspiracy to commit wire and mail fraud. Prosecutors contend that <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> solicited money for `` lifetime partnerships'' at his <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> USA </ORGANIZATION> retreat near <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mill </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> S.C. </LOCATION>, but used the the money for projects other than the lodging he promised. Lifetime partners typically paid $ 1,000 for the promise of three nights and four days annually at the theme park. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> raised $ 158 million through partnership sales. He resigned from the ministry in 1987 amid a sex and money scandal. <PERSON> Potter </PERSON> instructed the jury Tuesday night after closing arguments. `` You ca n't lie to people to send you money _ it's that simple,'' prosecutor <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> told the jury. `` You ca n't tell half-truths. If you do it, if you use the postal service and the public airwaves you will find yourself in federal court answering charges of mail and wire fraud. That's why we're here today, because that's just what Mr. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> did.'' <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON>'s attorneys said he was a victim of circumstances and a minister worried about the survival of his church. `` I think 95 percent of the evidence in this case by the government is circumstantial,'' said defense attorney <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON>. `` The government must prove beyond a reasonable doubt that the defendant had specific intent to commit fraud,'' <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said. `` He was conducting a ministry. He was doing what he thought was vital to the survival of his ministry.'' <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> insisted that the case was about money, not religion: `` What unfolded before you over the past month was a tale of corruption _ immense corruption. ... What was revealed here was that Mr. <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> was a world-class master of lies and half-truths.'' If convicted on all counts, <PERSON> Bakker </PERSON> faces up to 120 years in prison and more than $ 5 million in fines.

The 12,000 troops are `` going about their normal business'' to the extent possible under the restrictions, put in place Tuesday when rebel forces within the Panamanian <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> tried unsuccessfully to depose Gen. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. Meanwhile, <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials said the routine military exercises have been conducted all week on thoroughfares in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. `` We're exercising our troops,'' said one official, asking to remain anonymous. The exercises include convoys and troop workouts. As required, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials always notify the Panamanian <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> about the movements, the official said. Reconstructing events of Tuesday, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials confirmed that the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> had moved `` forces in a position to secure'' a causeway and a bridge on the Pan American Highway, which leads to the area where both the Panamanian <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Southern Command are located. The command's headquarters at Quarry Heights is about one-half mile from the main PDF barracks, the scene of gunfire and mortar attacks during Tuesday's coup attempt. `` We did move forces in a position to secure the causeway and the bridge of the <LOCATION> Americas </LOCATION> as a means of protecting <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> citizens who were on the base. Those are the major access routes to our base,'' said <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON>. The primary mission of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> is the protection of American citizens. The action also was taken to protect the American-built <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION>, the main reason <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops remain in the country. Under the 1977 <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> treaties, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is to maintain the neutrality of the waterway, which is to be turned over to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> at the end of the century. Armed American troops took up positions, including in front of the Defense Department-operated <ORGANIZATION> Balboa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, which was closed Wednesday. <PERSON> Wood </PERSON> said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops had also blocked the road that leads to <ORGANIZATION> Howard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> to the west of the command's headquarters. Under the terms of the canal treaties, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is to turn over to the Panamanians on Dec. 31, 1999, all its military sites along the 50-mile waterway.

 A jury recommended Wednesday that convicted `` Night Stalker'' <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> die in the gas chamber, and the devil-worshiping serial killer snarled: `` Big deal, death always went with the territory, see you in <LOCATION> Disneyland </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON>, convicted of 13 savage murders, rocked in his chair and peered around at courtroom spectators seated behind him as Superior Court Judge <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tynan </PERSON> read aloud the jury's recommendations, count by count. Jurors found <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> deserved the death penalty on 19 special circumstances attached to felony convictions that included multiple murders, burglary and sex crimes. State law requires a separate jury finding of special circumstances before the death penalty can be imposed. As of Oct. 2, there were 265 inmates on death row in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Tynan </PERSON> will consider the jury's recommendations before he formally sentences <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> on Nov. 7. The facts of the case, however, made it unlikely the judge would reduce the sentence to life in prison without the possibility of parole, the only other possible sentence. Under <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> law, the death sentence will be automatically appealed. <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> made no comment in the courtroom but uttered his `` Disneyland'' remark to reporters while being taken back to jail. He apparently was referring to his lawyer's contention to the jury that life in prison was sufficient. `` He will never see <ORGANIZATION> Disneyland </ORGANIZATION> again,'' lawyer <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> had said. The judge thanked the jurors profusely for the year they had spent on the case. `` I'm very proud of you,'' he told them. `` I know you had a tough time of it. ... It was a very emotionally charged case. I want to thank you for the public. God bless you.'' `` I have nightmares all the time about the crimes,'' said juror <PERSON> Cynthia </PERSON> <PERSON> Haden </PERSON>. `` I'll get over it, but I'll never be the same. I'll never look at people the same. `` How are you going to return to a normal life after going through something like this?'' asked another juror, <PERSON> Bonita </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>. The jury's deliberations lasted five days in the death penalty phase of the trial. The jurors did not look at <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> as the word `` death'' was pronounced 19 times by <PERSON> Tynan </PERSON>, but they answered in firm voices, `` Yes, your honor,'' when the judge polled them individually. Juror <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Carrillo </PERSON> said there was little dissension among jurors over whether to recommend the death penalty. The panel took its time simply because there were so many counts. `` It took a lot of thinking,'' he said. He added about <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON>, `` I think he's a pretty crazy man.'' `` He got what he deserved,'' said Deputy District Attorney <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Philip </PERSON> <PERSON> Halpin </PERSON>, who had urged the death penalty, describing <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> to the jury as `` a miserable human being'' who killed for self-gratification. Defense attorney <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> had pleaded for mercy. `` I think all human beings are deserving of our sympathy and should not have their lives taken in the streets, in the courts or in the gas chamber,'' said defense attorney <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Hernandez </PERSON>, adding he does not think <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> wants to die. `` There's no punishment that could fit this crime,'' <PERSON> Judi </PERSON> <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON>, daughter of Night Stalker victims <PERSON> Maxon </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lela </PERSON> <PERSON> Kneiding </PERSON>, said tearfully after the verdicts. She said <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> should die. `` I have to live the rest of my life seeing my parents -LRB- as murder victims -RRB- and what Mr. <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> did to them.'' Jurors ruled Sept. 20 that the 29-year-old native of <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paso </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, was the demonic killer who broke into homes through unlocked windows and doors in the summer of 1985. As the pattern of satanic crimes unfolded, investigators found men murdered in their beds, and women raped and beaten as the assailant demanded money and jewels. <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> was convicted of 13 murders and 30 related felonies ranging from rape and sodomy to burglary. In one murder, a victim's eyes were gouged out In another, a woman was raped beside the body of her murdered husband. Satanic symbols were left at some murder scenes and some victims were forced to `` swear to Satan'' by the killer, who held <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> in a grip of terror during his rampage. At a preliminary hearing <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON> held up a hand inscribed with a pentagram, a symbol of devil worship, and said, `` Hail Satan.'' For jurors, the penalty recommendation ended more than a year of jury service during which they endured the murder of one of their own panel members, likely to become a point of appeal. Juror <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Singletary </PERSON> was found slain at her home Aug. 15 in the midst of jury deliberations on <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON>'s guilt or innocence. Her live-in boyfriend committed suicide a day later and left a note admitting he had killed her. <PERSON> Ramirez </PERSON>, sullen through most of the trial, usually hid his eyes behind dark glasses. At the end of the guilt phase he refused to be present in court and was allowed to listen through a speaker in a nearby cell. Confronting photographers after his conviction, he flashed a two-fingered `` devil sign'' and muttered the word: `` Evil.''

 The <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> seized a ship carrying 11,500 pounds of cocaine _ the largest maritime cocaine seizure in history, <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> officials said Wednesday. The Zedom Sea, a 185-foot offshore supply vessel reportedly headed from <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> but flying the <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> flag, is being escorted to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Orleans </LOCATION>, said Rear Adm. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Merlin </PERSON>. Nine people aboard were arrested and will be turned over to the <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, he said. `` We are not sure we have found all the cocaine,'' <PERSON> Merlin </PERSON> said at a news conference at regional <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> headquarters here. `` We are turning it over to Customs.'' The vessel was seized Monday when the crew of the cutter Cushing boarded it in the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, off the <LOCATION> Yucatan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Peninsula </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Merlin </PERSON> said. It was expected to dock early Thursday. The cocaine was hidden on the deck in huge shipping containers the size of railroad box cars, <PERSON> Merlin </PERSON> said. It was mixed among a cargo of portland cement and in fake walls of the containers, he said. <PERSON> Merlin </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> has been patrolling the western Gulf on the lookout for possible smugglers and found the ship headed due west about 60 miles northwest of Progreso, a port on the <LOCATION> Yucatan </LOCATION>. `` All ships in the <LOCATION> Yucatan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Channel </LOCATION> are suspect to us at this time,'' <PERSON> Merlin </PERSON> said. He said the boarding crew became suspicious because the vessel was listed as hauling cement and gelatin, described as an unusual cargo. In addition, he said, the ship's registry gave its destination as <PERSON> Vera </PERSON> <PERSON> Cruz </PERSON> but the captain said it was going to <LOCATION> Tampico </LOCATION>. The ship was reportedly coming from <LOCATION> Baranquilla </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>, said Lt. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Philbin </PERSON>. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> Lt. Cmdr. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> called it the `` largest maritime cocaine seizure in history'' and added, `` This gives us a pretty good run.'' Last weekend, he said, the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> seized 2,000 to 2,500 pounds of cocaine in a ship near <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> and, on Monday, seized about 1,000 pounds of the drug from an air drop near that island. `` In this fiscal year,'' which began Sunday, `` we've gotten about as much as we got all last year,'' he said. In fiscal 1989, the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> seized a total of about 12,000 pounds of cocaine, he said. `` We had a real lull after things in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION> went crazy,'' <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> said, referring to the <LOCATION> Colombian </LOCATION> government's crackdown on drug traffickers that began Aug. 18 after the assassination of a leading presidential candidate. `` For a long time, we did n't see anything,'' he said, until Sept. 10, when the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> seized about 1,200 pounds of cocaine offshore from <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>. `` After a long lull, things are moving again.'' The latest seizure follows by less than a week the largest cocaine seizure in history _ about 20 tons found in a warehouse in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. The only seizure close to that was nearly 12 tons in <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>. The largest previous maritime seizure of cocaine occurred in November 1987 in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lauderdale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, where officials found more than 8,700 pounds of cocaine in hollowed-out lumber that had been cut for patio furniture.

 Officers trying to depose Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> held him hostage for up to five hours, but let him go after loyal forces told his captors they would `` face the consequences'' if any harm came to the general, a <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> aide said Wednesday. Lt. Col. <PERSON> Arnulfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Castrejon </PERSON>, director for the <ORGANIZATION> Panamanian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, told journalists that during the coup attempt on Tuesday, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> `` had tried to calm his captors during the time he was held, trying to avoid a bloodshed.'' Lower-ranking officers attempting the coup were defeated after loyal forces surrounded <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> headquarters and counterattacked. `` The surrender came when the loyal officers took command of the combat units and gave the rebels a last chance to release the commander and members of his staff or face the consequences,'' <PERSON> Castrejon </PERSON> said. `` The general was a hostage for four hours.'' Later <PERSON> Castrejon </PERSON> said <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was held for five hours. It was not clear if <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was released before or after the final violent assault on the headquarters that led to the rebel forces' surrender. `` He was confident that elite forces and the special forces and rest of the officers and soldiers of the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> were going to solve the problem immediately, as it happened,'' <PERSON> Castrejon </PERSON> added. <PERSON> Castrejon </PERSON> spoke briefly to reporters in front of <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> headquarters Wednesday and did not say who coordinated the rescue and counterattack operation. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials, speaking on condition of anonymity in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said they were mystified by the decision to let <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> go. `` <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was in their clutches,'' said one <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official Wednesday. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has been trying to oust <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> since February 1988, when he was indicted on drug trafficking and money laundering charges in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. If things had gone right for the rebels, `` <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> would have been at night court in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> listening to a judge telling him he was being detained without bail,'' one <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said wistfully. However, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Secretary of Defense <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials did n't know how long <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> had been held and told reporters, `` Clearly they -LRB- his captors -RRB- were not of a mind to turn him over to us.'' In <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, neighbors said they saw <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> enter Defense Forces headquarters with members of his staff Tuesday morning, and that the shooting began about 10 minutes later. They spoke on condition of anonymity. During the fighting <PERSON> Castrejon </PERSON> made a television announcement saying <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was in an undisclosed location and was in radio contact with his troops. Later, Maj. <PERSON> Edgardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> had personally taken the rebels' surrender, meaning he was on the spot when the fighting ended. The headquarters building is a four-story structure that occupies an entire city block. The Urraca company, whose soldiers were involved in the coup attempt, is located in barracks across a small patio in the same Defense Forces compound that extends for several hundred yards along <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bay </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Blandon </PERSON>, a Panamanian defector once close to <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, said in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> he had been told by a coup leader over the telephone during the uprising that the general had been wounded, but when <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> appeared before television cameras later there was no sign of an injury. Asked why the rebels would decide to free <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, one <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said, `` It's crazy. I do n't understand it.'' The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said they are concerned that the rebels face a bleak future in detention. The sources said some of the insurgents involved in the March 1988 uprising are still being tortured. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have refused to comment on reports that some of the rebels took refuge at <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> Quarry </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heights </LOCATION>, a few hundred yards from the fighting. Asked if anything positive occurred during Tuesday's events, the officials said <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> had tried hard through purges to ensure the loyalty of the Defense Forces but was still unable to head off an uprising. Tuesday's coup attempt also was much closer to succeeding than the 1988 insurrection, the officials said, adding that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s own behavior Tuesday evening indicated how close he had come to being deposed <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was ebullient after riding out the earlier coup and was far more subdued this time, they said. By Wednesday, however, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> leaned out a window to wave to a cheering crowd of supporters outside his bullet-pocked headquarters.

 The <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> refused Wednesday to block the extradition of a juvenile facing a possible death sentence in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> in connection with a 1988 firebombing that killed a 14-month-old boy. A three-judge panel of the court ruled that the district must honor an interstate agreement governing the extradition of juveniles, despite the district's own ban against capital punishment. `` If our city, through its courts, does not respect its obligations to other jurisdictions, then they will not respect theirs to us,'' Associate Judge <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwelb </PERSON> wrote in a concurring opinion. `` Under the compact, the district's word is its bond. The youth, identified only by the initials O.M., has been held by district authorities since last December, when he was arrested in connection with a warrant issued by <LOCATION> Gadsden </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, authorities, charging him with arson and murder in the death of <PERSON> Tamel </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>. The infant was killed when a firebomb was hurled into a <LOCATION> Gadsden </LOCATION> apartment. <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> authorities also have charged two uncles of O.M. with arson and murder in the case. One of the uncles, another juvenile identified by the initials <LOCATION> S.T. </LOCATION>, was arrested by district authorities in August and is fighting extradition. The appeals court ruling dissolves an order that had been blocking O.M.'s extradition. One of the boy's lawyers, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Klein </PERSON> of the district's public defender's office, declined to comment on whether new legal challenges will be filed. Detective Lt. <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Gadsden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said he will make travel plans to pick up O.M. and return him to <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> as soon as the department is notified officially of the ruling. The case has attracted widespread attention because of contentions by O.M.'s lawyers that he can not get a fair trial from the predominantly white judicial system in <LOCATION> Etowah </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, where both his father and another relative died while in police custody.

<HEAD>Teacher Claims He Was Demoted For Having Band Play Willie Nelson

<TEXT>
 The former chairman of the high school music department has sued claiming he was demoted because the band played <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>'s romantic ballad `` Always On My Mind'' in a town Memorial Day parade. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> was teaching Wednesday and could not be immediately reached for comment. He contended in his <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> lawsuit that his demotion `` constitutes unlawful intimidation, coersion and harassment.'' <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> is suing for back pay and restoration as chairman. <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Riley </PERSON>, an attorney for the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teachers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which is representing <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>, said the dispute stemmed from <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>' choice of the ballad for the 1988 Memorial Day parade. `` He was criticized at the time by school officials as the tune was felt not to be appropriate military marching music,'' <PERSON> Riley </PERSON> said. `` We felt it was appropriate music and this reprisal violated his rights to academic freedom.'' Superintendent of Schools <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelley </PERSON>, whose memos criticized the selection `` an embarrassment,'' did not return telephone calls to his office. School attorney <PERSON> Spencer </PERSON> <PERSON> Tobin </PERSON> said <PERSON> Harris </PERSON>' demotion had nothing to do with musical selection. `` We are all <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> fans here,'' <PERSON> Tobin </PERSON> said from his <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> office.

 <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>'s provisional president on Wednesday blamed the aborted coup against Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> on a small group of disgruntled soldiers backed by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. In remarks to reporters, Provisional President <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> asserted Tuesday's attempted coup `` was fostered and supported by the government of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>'' but that it `` found no resonance of any kind within the ranks of the defense forces or citizens.'' He asserted there was no widespread dissatisfaction in the Panamanian military. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, the Defense Forces chief, uses his official position to maintain de facto control of the government. In Tuesday's coup attempt, rebel forces attacked and seized the Defense Forces headquarters in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and claimed to have ousted <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. But forces loyal to <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> counterattacked and took back the compound several hours later. The Panamanian military said about 65 rebel soldiers were detained. In his comments, <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> claimed videotapes show <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> tanks and `` <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> contingents in combat readiness blocking roads in our country in order to prevent contingents of the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> from having access to the headquarters.'' He said film and photographs would also be release as proof. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has denied the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> engineered the attempt to overthrow <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, but <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials had advance knowledge of it. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials said <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> forces moved into positions near the fighting for security reasons. <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> was asked why a superpower like the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would not be able to topple <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> if it really wanted to support a coup. `` It is clear that overt aggression backed by actual troops of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> would make everything too clear, and they really wanted to cover up their ambitions in this area. But there is clear evidence, photographs and so on, that there was support from the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> stationed in our country,'' said <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>. He said his provisional government will `` evaluate'' whether to hold national elections some time after March but that <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> can not hold free and fair elections until the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> ends its `` military and economic aggression.'' The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government has been trying to force out <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> since two federal grand juries in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> indicted him on drug-trafficking and money-laundering charges last year. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> efforts have included diplomatic pressure and trade and economic sanctions against <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. But the steps have not budged <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, whose government annulled May 7 presidential elections. International observers said opposition candidate <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Endara </PERSON> won the presidency by a landslide. <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON>, a longstanding associate of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, was installed as a provisional president after the election was nullified.

 Tens of thousands of <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Machinists, angered by what they called a stingy wage offer from the aerospace giant, hit the picket lines Wednesday and said they would remain on strike until they got a better offer Pickets walked in 45-degree weather outside one of <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> plants, waving signs as motorists and truck drivers honked horns `` The attitude's good,'' said Machinist <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> McTighe </PERSON>. `` People are willing to picket, willing to do whatever it takes. The attitude seems to be militant.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union, which represents 43,000 <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> workers in the Puget Sound area, 12,000 at <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Wichita </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION>, plant, 1,700 in <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, and smaller numbers in a half-dozen other locations, struck at 12:01 a.m. PDT when its contract expired. Federal mediator <PERSON> Douglas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hammond </PERSON>, who joined the talks over the weekend, said he wanted negotiations to resume quickly between the two sides because of the number of people affected and the potential impact of a long strike at <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s largest private employer. No talks were announced, although both sides indicated Tuesday they were willing to resume negotiating. Members of other unions reported to work Wednesday, and <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> continued production work in the <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> area with management and non-union employees. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Russ </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said the strike began peacefully with no reports of friction at any of the company's plants. However, at the request of <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> lawyers, a federal judge in <LOCATION> Wichita </LOCATION> issued an injunction limiting the number of pickets at <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> gates and prohibiting pickets from speaking in an abusive or intimidating manner to employees trying to report for work. The order was granted after pickets stopped each vehicle headed toward the plant, attempting to persuade the occupants to honor strike lines. Traffic was snarled, with delays of three hours or more reported. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>'s contract offer included an immediate raise of 4 percent with 3 percent raises in both 1990 and 1991, plus annual bonuses of 8 percent of a worker's gross earnings this year and 3 percent the next. Workers have n't had an increase in base wages _ which determine pensions and other benefits _ for six years, although <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> paid bonuses of 12 percent in 1986 and 5 percent in 1987 and 1988. The proposal also would have reduced compulsory overtime from 200 hours a quarter to 160 hours and boosted some benefits and the cost-of-living adjustment. For the average Machinist making $ 13.39 per hour, the offer would have meant an additional $ 13,800 in income over the next three years. The Machinists have declined to disclose their exact bargaining position. However, members have indicated they were disappointed by the proposed pay raise from <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>, which is enjoying record prosperity, and were upset the offer did not end mandatory overtime. `` Most people we talked to were basically insulted by the contract,'' said picket <PERSON> Bryce </PERSON> <PERSON> Bushby </PERSON>. Worldwide, <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> employs 144,725 people, including 106,000 in western <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The company posted a profit of $ 614 million on $ 16.96 billion in sales last year. The strike hits <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> in its fifth consecutive year of record jetliner orders as airlines update aging fleets. The wave of orders has caused huge backlogs, pressuring <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> to maintain delivery schedules and forcing workers to put in heavy overtime. Although Pentagon cutbacks have reduced military business for <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>'s other divisions, <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commercial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airplanes </ORGANIZATION> has a backlog of nearly 1,600 jets worth about $ 70 billion and deliveries extending well into the mid-1990s. The <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union represents the bulk of the company's production workers, who perform tasks ranging from riveting, wiring and plumbing in aircraft to quality inspections and machine-tool maintenance Young declined to say how the strike would affect <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>'s aircraft deliveries and said there were no immediate plans to bring in outside workers

 <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Democrats put the brakes on a bill to ban flag desecration late Wednesday, saying a pair of Republican-sponsored changes in the wording would leave it vulnerable to a <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> challenge. `` The one thing we are required to avoid doing, or giving the court an excuse to suggest we are doing, is to proscribe any communicative ideas ... any speech,'' Sen. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Biden </PERSON>, D-Del., said as the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> postponed action He said, however, that the court might well interpret the proposed changes as an effort to limit freedom of speech. Sponsors had expected to pass the bill Wednesday afternoon but instead ended up hoping to win approval on Thursday. The bill is a response to the uproar that followed a decision by the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> that overturned a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> flag-burning ban last June. Lawmakers also acknowledged that the bill represents a move to head off a proposed constitutional amendment against flag-burning, set to come before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in mid-October. A number of senators, mainly Democrats, say amending the Constitution is not the proper way to deal with the issue, but many other lawmakers say it is the only way to get around the court decision. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has called for a constitutional amendment against flag burning, as have many congressional conservatives. At issue were only three words that Republicans sought to add to the House-passed legislation. One amendment offered by Minority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, R-Kan., would make it clear that flag desecration was banned only if it occurred `` publicly. The other, sponsored by Sen. <PERSON> Pete </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, R-Calif., would make it illegal to `` physically defile'' the flag The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> case ruled in effect that flag-burner <PERSON> Gregory </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> was convicted not for setting a flag afire but because he was engaging in political protest. It said that limited his freedom of speech and overturned the law on that ground. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> sponsors want the measure to avoid that problem by banning any flag desecration, regardless of whether it involves political protest. Debate over exactly what the Republican amendments would do meandered into semantic thickets unusual even for the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor. <PERSON> Biden </PERSON> said drily it was too bad former Sen. S.I. <PERSON> Hayakawa </PERSON>, R-Calif., a noted authority on semantics as well as a politician, was not still around to help out with the debate The bill differs only slightly from an existing federal law against flag burning. Current law bans any action that `` knowingly casts contempt upon any flag of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> by publicly mutilating, defacing, defiling, burning or trampling upon it.'' It provides for penalties of up to a $ 1,000 fine and a year in jail. The <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> law had a similar wording. `` The statutory approach in my opinion is a futile and ineffective gesture which will not pass the constitutional test at all,'' <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON> said. Some critics said that there is no wide outbreak of flag burning in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and that the bill would encroach on freedom of speech as a means of fighting a danger that does not exist. `` It's not needed for the maintenance of democratic freedom,'' Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerrey </PERSON>, D-Neb. said. `` Of all things, today in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> we need to encourage our people to be less afraid, speaking what they believe, letting their minds and hearts give rise to what they truly think ought to be done,'' <PERSON> Kerrey </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> also said provisions of the measure designed to make sure it would not be interpreted as an attack on dissent would be difficult to deal with. For example, the measure would ban flag desecration in private. `` It will criminalize a great deal of relatively trivial behavior,'' he said. `` It will change the flag from a treasured symbol to a government-regulated icon.'' Lawmakers made it clear from the outset, however, that the bill was popular enough to guarantee overwhelming approval. `` I am going to vote for this,'' Sen. <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Sanford </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.C. </LOCATION> said. `` The people of my state are for it.'' `` The flag represents the very heart of what it means to be an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> and it would be a tragedy for us to let its power be undermined through legal desecration,'' Sen. <PERSON> Howell </PERSON> <PERSON> Heflin </PERSON>, D-Ala., said

 Anger mounted on Capitol Hill Wednesday among both Democrats and Republicans at President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s handling of the failed coup attempt in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>, with one senior <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> lawmaker saying: `` We blew it.'' But others, after being briefed by <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON>, said they agreed with the administration's caution in the face of weak intelligence flowing in from <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> during the uprising on Tuesday. Rep. <PERSON> Ike </PERSON> <PERSON> Skelton </PERSON>, D-Mo., likened the situation to the failed attempt by exiled Cubans to invade at the Bay of Pigs in 1961, when <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> support was withheld at the crucial moment `` Why have 12,000 troops in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> who are highly motivated and trained, and not use them in either a military or a paramilitary manner?'' asked <PERSON> Skelton </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. `` We had full knowledge they were going to do this. I'm afraid it's a matter of cold feet,'' <PERSON> Skelton </PERSON> said in an interview. `` It was a conscious decision -LRB- by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> -RRB- not to assist ... I'm furious about it.'' On his way to the briefing, <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> told reporters the administration believes <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was in the control of the rebels for a time, though it had not been clear during the uprising this was the case. `` Clearly they were not of the mind to turn him over to us,'' <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is under federal indictment in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> for drug trafficking. Later, after the hour-long <LOCATION> Cheney </LOCATION> briefing, <PERSON> Skelton </PERSON> said the administration's doubts were n't sufficient justification for inaction. `` They wanted certainty. Well, you do not get an engraved invitation to a coup ... They just lacked boldness.'' `` We look indecisive, vacillating and weak,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hyde </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ill </LOCATION>. `` The consequences from this could be profound. `` We blew it,'' said Rep. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Broomfield </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, the senior Republican on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's a major setback for our foreign policy. It raises questions whether people down there can ever have confidence in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Broomfield </PERSON> said if the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> had advance knowledge of the coup plans and had called in senior congressional leaders, the administration would have found ample support for a limited military response to the uprising. Sen. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Sasser </PERSON>, D-Tenn., who attended the closed briefing conducted by <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> and Gen. <PERSON> Colin </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Staff </ORGANIZATION>, for members of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, raised questions about the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>' intelligence capability in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> `` It would appear to me that we would have better intelligence sources in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> than we have,'' <PERSON> Sasser </PERSON> told reporters. `` The fact that this coup materialized, we do n't have notice of it sooner than we did, we could not have reacted quicker to it, I think it's some indication that our intelligence sources in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> are not as adequate as we have a right to expect them to be given our long presence in that country.'' Asked after the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> briefing what the coup attempt means for <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> said: `` If I was in General <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s shoes, I'd be a very nervous man tonight. Here's a guy whose got to have doubts given the fact that one of his close supporters tried to run a coup on him. That ca n't give him great confidence about his own security.'' There were some lawmakers supportive of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s decision, as well. `` The president was absolutely correct,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> McDade </PERSON>, R-Pa. `` We're not an invading force We'd like to see General <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> out, but I support the president in what he did.'' `` They deserve credit for the coolness and calmness they displayed under very difficult circumstances,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Solarz </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N </LOCATION>. Opponents of <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s inaction were far more vocal. <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Les </PERSON> <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON>, D-Wis., said the administration apparently has decided on a policy of not using force in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> `` Any disturbance like this should have provided the necessary cover and opportunity to move with military force against <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON> said. `` We ought to be ready at any opportunity ... They did not seize the moment.'' `` This is laissez-faire diplomacy and it's outrageous,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> McCurdy </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Okla </LOCATION>., a member of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> He said it would apparently have been relatively easy to support the rebels, but the administration `` blinked.'' `` Yesterday makes <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> look like a man of resolve. There's a resurgence of the wimp factor,'' <PERSON> McCurdy </PERSON> said. `` There is a role for force in our foreign policy. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would have come off as a hero in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, and probably throughout <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Now, instead, we have a major credibility problem.'' Lack of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> support for the rebels makes it even more remote that any members of the Panamanian military will risk another uprising, he said. `` Who's going to volunteer to do this now?''

 Human rights activists and the leaders of democratic forces in communist <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> were high on the list of 90 candidates for the Nobel Peace Prize, to be announced Thursday. The Peace Prize is given by a five-member committee chosen by the Norwegian parliament and the other Nobels are awarded by the prize committee in <LOCATION> Stockholm </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>. Candidates included <PERSON> Abbe </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierre </PERSON>, a French Roman Catholic priest nominated for humanitarian work; <PERSON> Bruno </PERSON> <PERSON> Hussar </PERSON>, who set up an Israeli-Palestinian peace village in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> <PERSON> Mandela </PERSON>, the imprisoned black South African leader, and the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scout </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Movement </ORGANIZATION>, celebrating its 100th year. Sources who have been reliable in the past said the <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON>, exiled god-king of Tibetan Buddhists, had a chance of being chosen, but the ferment in eastern <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> caused speculation that the prize would go a democratic leader in the region. Often in recent years, the Peace Prize has been used to encourage trends considered worthy and to build international support for peace efforts. The 1987 award to President <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> was considered a major boost to his Central American peace plan, which was adopted by the five presidents involved. Last year, the prize went to the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping forces. Dagbladet, an <LOCATION> Oslo </LOCATION> newspaper, put two Czechoslovak dissidents, writer <PERSON> Vaclav </PERSON> <PERSON> Havel </PERSON> and <PERSON> Jiri </PERSON> <PERSON> Hajek </PERSON>, foreign minister in the reformist government of <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Dubcek </PERSON> at the time of the 1968 Soviet-led invasion, among the leading candidates for 1989. They were signers of the Charter 77 human rights manifesto in communist <LOCATION> Czechoslovakia </LOCATION>. Members of <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>'s parliament collectively nominated the Baltic republics of <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>, which were independent when the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> absorbed them in 1940. President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and former President <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> were early nominees for their 1987 agreement to eliminate medium-range nuclear missiles. Nominations close on Feb. 1 and the accord came too late for last year's prize. The first Peace Prize was awarded in 1901, but in 19 years none was given. Nobel prizes this year are worth three million Swedish kronor _ $ 469,000 at the current exchange rate. Prizes for peace, chemistry, literature, medicine and physics were established by the estate of <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Nobel </PERSON>, who invented dynamite and made a fortune. A sixth prize, in economics, was added later and financed <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>'s central bank. Members of the Norwegian committee are <PERSON> Egil </PERSON> <PERSON> Aarvik </PERSON>, a retired journalist and <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> minister; former Prime Minister <PERSON> Odvar </PERSON> <PERSON> Nordli </PERSON>; history professor <PERSON> Francis </PERSON> <PERSON> Sejersted </PERSON>, the Rev. <PERSON> Gunnar </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Staalsett </PERSON>, a Lutheran minister, and author <PERSON> Gidske </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 Security forces arrested three members of Gen. <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s general staff and about 35 other soldiers after a failed coup, according to a `` war communique'' read over national radio Wednesday. Panamanian officials also said rebelling troops held <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> for several hours during the attempted coup Tuesday but that the coup's leader was killed during the fighting The communique did not give any reason for the arrests of Col. <PERSON> Guillermo </PERSON> <PERSON> Wong </PERSON>, the head of state security, and two other members of the 20-member High Command, the Panamanian equivalent of a general staff. If members of the High Command were implicated in the coup, however, it would mean the plotting against <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> extended much higher than the lower-level officers involved in the rebellion. In those clashes, rebel soldiers captured the headquarters in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, but troops loyal to <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> recaptured the compound several hours later. Wednesday's government communique said 10 rebels were killed in the fighting and 26 people were wounded. There were 18 wounded in forces loyal to <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>, three from the rebel forces and five civilians, it said. The communique also said five coup leaders had taken refuge at <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clayton </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> base a few miles from <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials have refused comment on that report. The other two arrested members of the High Command were Col. <PERSON> Julio </PERSON> Ow Young and Col. <PERSON> Armando </PERSON> <PERSON> Palacios </PERSON> <PERSON> Gondola </PERSON>. Both had recently served as <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> representatives when the Noriega-controlled government held talks with the civil opposition in August. In addition, <PERSON> Palacios </PERSON> was a member of the combined staff of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Panamanian officers that deals with <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canal </LOCATION> security and defense issues. Defense Forces spokesmen were not available for comment on the arrests, according to people who answered phones at headquarters. The communique read by an announcer did nothing more than list the names and ranks of those arrested, wounded or killed. Earlier, Maj. <PERSON> Edgardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said at least 60 soldiers and four of five officers had been arrested shortly after the fighting. The arrest of Ow <PERSON> Young </PERSON> was puzzling because the officers who mounted Tuesday's coup effort had named him as an officer to be forcibly retired. One report said the lower-level officers who rebelled were disgruntled over not being promoted. In their only communique, the rebels said they were discarding the entire high command. That communique was signed by a major and tw captains. The other 20 officers arrested ranged in rank from second lieutenant to captain. About 15 sergeants, corporals and enlisted men were also under arrest, the communique said. The communique also said 10 rebels, including nine officers, died in the shooting Tuesday. It said the dead included Maj. <PERSON> Moises </PERSON> <PERSON> Giroldi </PERSON> <PERSON> Vega </PERSON>, commander of the <LOCATION> Urraca </LOCATION> company, which was blamed for the revolt. The unit is in charge of security at defense headquarters. Around <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, government troops patrolled lightly traveled streets Wednesday while <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> helicopters watched from overhead. `` The gringo piranhas want to do away with me,'' the general said during a brief tour of the street outside <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> Defense Forces headquarters. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has accused the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> of supporting the attempted coup. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has been trying to oust <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> for almost two years, but the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration denied any involved in Tuesday's coup attempt Later in the day, several thousand people, many of them public employees, demonstrated in front of the building to show their support for <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>. The general leaned out a second-story window and waved through iron bars. A <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> aide said Wednesday that rebel officers trying to depose <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> captured him and held him for several hours Tuesday but released him after loyal forces warned the rebels would `` face the consequences'' if he was harmed. Lt. Col. <PERSON> Arnulfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Castrejon </PERSON>, director for the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, told reporters that while being held Tuesday, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> `` had tried to calm his captors ... trying to avoid bloodshed.'' `` The surrender came when the loyal officers took command of the combat units and gave the rebels a last chance to release the commander and members of his staff or face the consequences,'' <PERSON> Castrejon </PERSON> said. `` The general was a hostage for four hours.'' Later, however, <PERSON> Castrejon </PERSON> said <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was held five hours. It was not clear if <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was held when the final assault was made by loyal troops. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials, speaking on condition of anonymity in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said earlier Wednesday they were mystified by the decision to let <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> go. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has been imposed economic sanctions and tried other measures to oust <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> after he was indicted on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> drug trafficking and money laundering charges in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> in February 1988. <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> denies the charges. In <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, neighbors said they saw <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> enter Defense Forces headquarters with members of his staff Tuesday morning, and that the shooting began about 10 minutes later. They spoke on condition of anonymity. During the fighting, <PERSON> Castrejon </PERSON> made a TV announcement saying <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> was in an undisclosed location and was in radio contact with his troops. Later, <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, said <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> had personally taken the rebels' surrender, meaning he was on the spot when the fighting ended. Many Panamanians chose to stay home Wednesday and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bases were shut under condition <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION>, which restricts movement of personnel. About 12,000 American soldiers are stationed in <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. The uprising `` aggravated the Panamanian crisis in every dimension and makes it more dangerous,'' opposition leader <PERSON> Ricardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> <PERSON> Calderon </PERSON> told a news conference. He said the military regime `` is divided against itself and rejected by the great majority of the people.'' Civilian foes of <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> denied involvement. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sanctions have damaged the economy, but <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> remains. He annulled the opposition's election victory May 7 and has put down two coup attempts. After the battle Tuesday, <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> replaced the 350-member Urraca company, with the <ORGANIZATION> Machos </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> de </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monte </ORGANIZATION>, or Wild Boars, a unit that joined the counterattack. At the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, President <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> told a news conference the coup was attempted by a small group of soldiers `` fostered and supported by the government of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> ... that found no resonance of any kind within the ranks of the Defense Forces or citizens.''

 Dr. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Wybran </PERSON>, the leader of <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>'s Jewish community, was shot to death in a hospital parking lot in what the justice minister on Wednesday called an act of terrorism. Police said <PERSON> Wybran </PERSON>, 49, was shot once in the head from close range at about 6 p.m. Tuesday as he approached his car outside <ORGANIZATION> Brussels </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, where he headed the immunology department. He underwent emergency surgery but died early Wednesday. No one claimed responsibility. Wybran, head of a coalition of Jewish groups, was a moderate in the Israeli-Arab conflict. He campaigned for removal of a Roman Catholic convent from the site of the <LOCATION> Auschwitz </LOCATION> concentration camp in <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>. Justice Minister <PERSON> Melchior </PERSON> <PERSON> Wathelet </PERSON> told a radio station Wednesday, `` This cold-blooded murder committed with such efficiency points to a terrorist act, probably linked to the role Dr. <PERSON> Wybran </PERSON> played at the head of the Jewish community _ even worse, because of his moderation.'' There were no witnesses. Police made a nationwide appeal for information. Police were investigating whether the killing was anti-Semitic or political. Prime Minister <PERSON> Yitzhak </PERSON> <PERSON> Shamir </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> said <PERSON> Wybran </PERSON> would `` go down in history as an example of a Jew who fought for the sake of his people.'' A statement from the <ORGANIZATION> Israeli </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> said <PERSON> Wybran </PERSON> had no personal enemies, and `` it is therefore evident'' that he `` was assassinated in cold blood because he was a Jew.'' <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Peytier </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> prosecutor's office, said, `` Given the nature of his activities, it can not be excluded that this was a political attack. He added that `` at first sight it is very unlikely, not to say beyond probability'' that <PERSON> Wybran </PERSON> was killed for private reasons. Prime Minister <PERSON> Wilfried </PERSON> <PERSON> Martens </PERSON> issued a statement expressing `` indignation at violence and intolerance.'' Wybran headed the <ORGANIZATION> Coordinating </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jewish </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organizations </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, which represents about 30,000 Jews in this overwhelmingly Catholic country of 9.9 million. He also served as chairman of the Belgian chapter of the <ORGANIZATION> Auschwitz </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, which has pressed for removal of an order of Carmelite nuns from the site of the former <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> death camp. On a recent visit to <LOCATION> Poland </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Wybran </PERSON> urged authorities to publicly oppose anti-Semitism and other forms of racism. Jewish leaders say the convent and its religious symbols are offensive at place where 2.5 million Jews were killed. The church has said it will move the convent to an interfaith center to be built nearby. Israeli Ambassador <PERSON> Avi </PERSON> <PERSON> Primor </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> Israeli </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> army </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> radio </ORGANIZATION> Wednesday that neo-Nazis might have been behind <PERSON> Wybran </PERSON>'s murder because of his involvement in the <LOCATION> Auschwitz </LOCATION> matter. In 1980, one youngster was killed in a grenade attack in <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> on 50 Jewish teen-agers bound for summer camp. Three people were killed the next year when an explosives-laden van blew up outside an <LOCATION> Antwerp </LOCATION> synagogue and, in 1982, attackers sprayed a <LOCATION> Brussels </LOCATION> synagogue with automatic weapons fire, wounding four people.

<HEAD>New Wire Transfer Regulations in the Works</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is planning regulations aimed at money-laundering by international wire transfer, a <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> official said Wednesday night. Another initiative soon will require banks to report domestic currency deposits of more than $ 10,000 on computer tapes, this official said. The current reports of those large deposits are made on paper forms. The banks `` file millions of those, year in and year out. It creates an avalanche of paper'' that is extremely difficult to handle by law enforcement agencies trying to track drug profits, the official said. The official, who spoke on condition of anonymity, said he was summarizing testimony earlier in the day by <PERSON> Salvatore </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Martoche </PERSON>, assistant secretary of the treasury for enforcement, before the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Foreign Relations subcommittee on terrorism, narcotics and international operations. Just as they report large domestic deposits, banks report transfers of large sums of cash to and from foreign banks. But there is no requirement to report international wire transfers, used increasingly by drug traffickers to move profits to safe havens. `` It is very difficult to draft regulations in this area,'' the official said. `` We will be looking very carefully at what can be done.'' The official declined to say what the substance of international wire transfer regulations might be. `` We had meetings six weeks ago with foreign countries in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. We do have some discussions under way and further discussions will be held. As to what comes out of them, you will have to check back in a few months,'' he said.

<TEXT>
 Prosecution and defense attorneys rested their cases Wednesday in the 3-year-old McMartin preschool molestation trial, setting the stage for closing arguments to begin next week. Superior Court Judge <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Pounders </PERSON>, who often expressed fear that the case would end in a mistrial, scheduled lawyers' summations to begin Oct. 12 and said he expects the matter to go to the jury by Nov. 1 <PERSON> Pounders </PERSON> said he expects the balance of the case, including jury deiberations, to take up to three months. `` I've got three months to keep 12 jurors together and that makes me nervous,'' he added. The trial is the longest criminal proceeding in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> history. Its cost of $ 15 million has made it the most expensive case ever tried in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> Buckey </PERSON> 31, and his mother, <PERSON> Peggy </PERSON> <PERSON> McMartin </PERSON> <PERSON> Buckey </PERSON>, 62, are charged with 64 counts of molestation and a shared count of conspiracy involving alleged molestations of 11 children at their family owned school. `` This is almost as exciting as the day we started jury selection,'' Deputy District Attorney <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Gunson </PERSON> said after both sides had rested. Defense attorney <PERSON> Danny </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> said he believed the case could have been tried in four months if the prosecution had trimmed the number of charges and witnesses. He said that by now jurors probably do not remember much of the voluminous evidence. But he predicted a swift verdict acquitting the Buckeys. `` My prognosis is within two weeks after we submit it to the jury we'll have a verdict. You ca n't come to the same room for two years and not form an opinion on what you're going to do.'' The case began in 1983 as the largest child molestation prosecution ever. Seven teachers at the prestigious <ORGANIZATION> McMartin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pre-School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION> were arrested and it was alleged that hundreds of children had been molested during a five-year period. But after an 18-month preliminary hearing, charges were dropped against five defendants by District Attorney <PERSON> Ira </PERSON> <PERSON> Reiner </PERSON>, who said there was insufficient evidence to prosecute them. By then, the number of children allegedly involved had also dropped. Since the trial began in April 1987 the jury of 12 with a backup panel of six alternates has dwindled due to illness and employment problems. The last alternate was used recently to replace an ailing juror. A panel of 12 is required for a verdict in a criminal case. The prosecution's initial presentation of evidence took 14 months and the defense took 10 months. The prosecution also presented about a month of rebuttal testimony. In April, the trial became the longest in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> history, surpassing the two-year record of the Hillside Strangler case.

 More than 100 <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> personnel were joined by park rangers Wednesday in the search for eight people missing after a fishing boat struck a gas pipeline and exploded in the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. Three people were killed and three others injured in the accident, which happened just before dark Tuesday. The 20-square-mile search was hampered by the suspected presence of hazardous chemicals. `` If they were presumed dead, we would n't be searching,'' <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> Lt. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> LaRochelle </PERSON> said. `` The probability is high but there is still a possibility -LRB- of survivors -RRB-. There's always a hope.'' Two hazardous waste material experts boarded the boat later Wednesday but found no missing crew members or dangerous chemicals, officials said. The search was suspended later Wednesday but was expected to continue Thrusday. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Benson </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said the agency was sending a team to investigate. The five-member team was expected to arrive in nearby <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arthur </LOCATION> late Wednesday. A small fire continued to burn 18 hours after the 160-foot `` North Umberland'' apparently hit the 16-inch natural gas pipeline, triggering a spectacular blaze that sent flames hundreds of feet into the air, <PERSON> LaRochelle </PERSON> said. The main fire burned itself out Wednesday morning after the pipeline was turned off. Officials speculated that nets being trawled by the boat snagged the submerged pipeline and ruptured it, triggering the explosion. As divers stood by to inspect the ruptured pipeline and burned boat, <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> officials kept everyone 700 yards away from the wreck. They were concerned about the possible presence of anhydrous ammonia, a flammable coolant used on board fishing boats to preserve the catch. The <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> dive team of hazardous material experts was sent from Mobile, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, with equipment to test the air and water in the area. <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Parks </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wildlife </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> personnel, meanwhile, inspected 5 miles of beaches because prevailing currents would send survivors or victims toward the shore, the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> said. `` We're hoping to find some concrete evidence that will give us some hope that some people are still alive,'' <PERSON> LaRochelle </PERSON> said. Two victims and three survivors were spotted by private helicopters Tuesday night. A third was found just after noon Wednesday. The three injured survivors remained hospitalized in nearby <LOCATION> Beaumont </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Lori </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerr </PERSON>, a spokeswoman at <ORGANIZATION> Baptist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, said names of the victims were not being released immediately. She identified them as a 53-year-old man from Sulphur, <LOCATION> La. </LOCATION>, with burns over 68 percent of his body. His condition was listed as critical. The other two, both in good condition, were identified as a 28-year-oid from <LOCATION> Cameron </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La. </LOCATION>, suffering burns to his face and arms, and a 31-year-old from <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Charles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> La. </LOCATION>, suffering from shock. The <PERSON> Cameron </PERSON>, La.-based `` pogy boat'' caught pogy or menhaden, fish used for poultry feed and fertilizer, said <PERSON> Barney </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, spokesman for Houston-based <ORGANIZATION> Zapada </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Heynie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which owns the boat.

<HEAD>Soviet Union To Continue Suspension of Arms Shipments to Nicaragua</HEAD>

 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> will keep withholding arms shipments to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> to encourage the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to take similar steps in <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, officials announced Wednesday. The announcement was made in a Nicaraguan government statement at the end of a 24-hour visit by Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>. The Soviet official told reporters it amounted to a joint statement. The communique said the suspension `` is a contribution <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> are making toward a total solution to the conflict in the region and a decided support of the Central American presidential agreements.'' President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> and the presidents of four other Central American countries signed an agreement Aug. 7 calling for demobilizing the U.S.-backed Nicaraguan rebels based in border camps in <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. In exchange, the leftist <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> government agreed to make democratic reforms, including allowing free campaigning by the opposition for elections advanced to February 1990. The temporary halt to weapons shipments `` opens great opportunities,'' <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> said. He said a total and permanent suspension in weapons shipments would have to be `` reciprocated'' by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. However, he said the region also needs a way of setting limits on combat forces in the Central American countries. Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> told President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> in May that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> had suspended weapons shipments to <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> at the end of 1988. Soviet aid totaled $ 11.2 billion from 1980 to 1988, half of it in military assistance. Though it says it has cut off supplies of weapons, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has still sent <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>'s government $ 500 million in various forms of military aid this year. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has supported the Nicaraguan Contra rebels, who have fought to overthrow the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION>. However, it halted weapons shipments to them in February 1988 while continuing such aid as uniforms, food, vehicles and other supplies. However, the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> want the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to cut off all aid to the rebels. <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> also provides military and economic aid to the Salvadoran government in its 10-year-old war against a leftist insurgency. On the battlefront, <PERSON> Contra </PERSON> rebels attacked a military patrol in western <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> on Wednesday, killing six soldiers and wounding six, the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said. In a news release, the ministry said the attack occurred near the village of <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, 110 miles west of <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>. It gave no details of the fighting. The government radio, the Voice of <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, called the attack `` cowardly and treacherous,'' noting that the government has called a unilateral cease-fire in an effort to end the war. Also Wednesday, the <ORGANIZATION> Interior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said two election officials were kidnapped by Contras near the town of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nicolas </LOCATION>, about 80 miles north of <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION>. Its news release gave no details.

 British comedian <PERSON> Graham </PERSON> <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON>, a founding member of the `` <PERSON> Monty </PERSON> <PERSON> Python </PERSON>'s Flying Circus'' TV series, died Wednesday of cancer at <ORGANIZATION> Maidstone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>, aged 48, the hospital announced. <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Epstein </PERSON>, <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON>'s manager, said in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> that <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON> was rushed to the hospital from his home near <LOCATION> Maidstone </LOCATION> in southeast <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, 30 miles from <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, on Tuesday. The hospital announced the death in a statement early Thursday. The 6-foot-2, pipe-smoking star told reporters in August that he had been diagnosed as having cancer of the tonsils which apparently spread to his spine. <PERSON> Epstein </PERSON> said family members and friends, including other members of the <PERSON> Monty </PERSON> <PERSON> Python </PERSON> team, were with <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON> when he died. <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON> was educated at <ORGANIZATION> Cambridge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> and began his career as a physician before the <PERSON> Monty </PERSON> <PERSON> Python </PERSON> group was created in 1969, bringing together the talents of <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Cleese </PERSON>, <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Idle </PERSON>, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Palin </PERSON>, <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> and <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilliam </PERSON>. It was a fast-paced revue of sketches and blackouts pegged on absurd themes with a distinctly British bent. The show premiered on <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> television on Oct. 5, 1969, in a slot previously filled by a Sunday religious discussion. The last original show in the weekly TV series was broadcast in December 1974. The group's zany and often violent brand of comedy was an international hit, including in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, and influenced many other comics. Last February, Idle, <PERSON> Jones </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gilliam </PERSON> attended the opening in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> of the <ORGANIZATION> Museum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION>'s 20th Anniversary Salute to <PERSON> Monty </PERSON> <PERSON> Python </PERSON>, a 10-day retrospective marking the comedians' first appearance on British TV. <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON> played the leads in the troupe's first and second films: King Arthur in `` <PERSON> Monty </PERSON> <PERSON> Python </PERSON> and the Holy Grail'' issued in 1979, and <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> in `` Life of <PERSON> Brian </PERSON>,'' a parody on the life of <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> issued the same year that shocked many Christians. One critic wrote of `` Life of Brian'' at the time: `` This Monty Python religious parable will probably offend every denomination equally, but it should n't. The story of a man whose life parallels Christ is the funniest and most sustained feature yet from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s bad boys.'' The group's last film, `` <PERSON> Monty </PERSON> <PERSON> Python </PERSON>'s Meaning of Life,'' was released in 1983. The group celebrated its 20th anniversary three weeks ago by filming a television special to be released later this year. In an interview with the British newspaper The Sun two weeks ago, <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON> said he believed he had beaten cancer. `` It's just a matter of time before I'm fully well again,'' the paper quoted him as saying then. He said earlier that his loss of weight to 168 pounds was due to a healthy diet.

It was canceled Wednesday morning when it became apparent <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON> was seriously ill, said <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Lewis </PERSON>, who represents the Pythons in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Since `` <PERSON> Monty </PERSON> <PERSON> Python </PERSON>'s Meaning of Life,'' the members had gone their separate ways. <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON> starred as a cranky old knight in an English comedy television show called `` <PERSON> Jake </PERSON>'s Journey.'' Recently, <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON> had been writing for television and film in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Epstein </PERSON> said, and a comedy film <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON> produced and wrote was about to go into preproduction. <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON> is survived by a son who lives in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, a brother and nephews.

 His work does n't appear in glossy architectural magazines and he draws no raves reviews for his timber frames, collar beams and squat designs in bare concrete. But the American <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Beynon </PERSON> wins praise in <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> for designing schools that can stand up to cyclones, floods and earthquakes. `` No regrets,'' said the 53-year-old `` disaster architect'' when asked if he ever thinks about skyscrapers and glamorous homes he might have created. `` Here, we're dealing with very real, urgent problems and these you find in the poorest and remotest areas. There's more work than one can handle in a lifetime.'' Over the last few years a greater and more organized effort has been made in <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> on minimizing the blows of natural forces. Part of the impetus has come from massive disasters as the 1985 cyclone that killed 10,000 people in <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> and last year's earthquake in <LOCATION> Armenia </LOCATION>, where 25,000 people died. `` As someone pointed out after the Armenian earthquake, ` Earthquakes do n't kill people, buildings do,''' <PERSON> Beynon </PERSON> said. `` There are very few natural disasters which should inevitably destroy a building.'' The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Educational </ORGANIZATION>, Scientific and Cultural Organization -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> UNESCO </ORGANIZATION> -RRB-, where <PERSON> Beynon </PERSON> serves as principal architect, is focusing on disaster-proofing school buildings in nearly 20 Asian nations including <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> India </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>. `` When there is a cyclone, go to the school,'' <ORGANIZATION> UNESCO </ORGANIZATION> advises Asians in villages where the school building is a safe structure and homes tend to be flimsy. If it survives a natural disaster, the school _ often the largest building of the community _ serves as the obvious center for shelter and relief. Conversely, rural children may suffer disproportionately high casualties in classrooms when natural disasters strike because the most densely populated area in an <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> village is likely to be the school, and it's often not safe enough. `` We do n't like to talk to officials in the capitals,'' <PERSON> Beynon </PERSON> said. `` We go to the end of the line.'' In <LOCATION> Nepal </LOCATION> this meant trekking for days to remote Himalayan hamlets where he learned that while iron and concrete may make for the best earthquake-proofing these are hardly the materials to be carried in on the backs of porters. Material available in the area has to be used. `` My first approach is to listen and learn from the people,'' <PERSON> Beynon </PERSON> said. `` During the first week you forget everything you know and look at the problem through their eyes and skills and then you try to improve on this. The greatest disaster is the instant expert.'' <PERSON> Beynon </PERSON> tries to persuade planners that for only a little added to a school's total cost _ 3 percent to 15 percent in the case of cyclone protection _ they can save lives as well as money in the long term. He tries to get local `` barefoot architects'' to provide ideas and skills. <ORGANIZATION> UNESCO </ORGANIZATION> gives assistance and training in the concepts of disaster architecture. To resist cyclones, a general term for typhoons, hurricanes and tropical storms, structures must be designed from the top down. The great wind force of a cyclone tends to lift buildings upwards so a system of special attachments running from roof to foundation must be incorporated to figuratively chain them down. To minimize earthquake damage, schools are designed to move with, rather than against, the various motions unleashed by seismic disturbances. Structures must be flexible yet also held together by encompassing `` bands'' of iron, wood or other materials. Schools in flood-prone regions are best set above the ground. They should include a waterproof room where equipment can quickly be secured as well as cooking and toilet facilities for those who take shelter. Since the school could serve as a final refuge and a platform for relief supplies from the sky, the roof must be built flat and strong. <PERSON> Beynon </PERSON> accumulated his skills at the <ORGANIZATION> Massachusetts </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION>, where he studied architecture, and while working for an American foundation sponsoring innovative work in educational design. He joined <ORGANIZATION> UNESCO </ORGANIZATION> in 1964 in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, moving in 1980 to its <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> where his team includes another architect, a civil engineer and a furniture designer. <PERSON> Beynon </PERSON> was called to the island of <LOCATION> Tonga </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> in 1982 after more than 10 percent of its schools were razed by Tropical Cyclone <PERSON> Isaac </PERSON>. Since cyclones strike <LOCATION> Tonga </LOCATION> in 20-year cycles, there had been little sense of urgency. With <PERSON> Beynon </PERSON>'s help cyclone-proof schools were designed and put up. Prefabricated construction was used for schools on outer islands that lacked skilled craftsmen. `` We'll have to wait another 15 years to see how good our work was,'' he said, referring to the 20-year cycles.

<HEAD>Despite Oil, Saudis Look to More Abundant Sunshine for Power</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The Saudis have oil reserves that will easily last 100 more years, but they're looking for a more abundant resource for their energy _ sunshine. The sun, which raises temperatures to 120 degrees in summer, disappears behind clouds only a few days a year and that's mainly in some of the higher plateau regions. A $ 26 million `` solar village'' with 160 photovoltaic solar generators each containing 251 solar cells is operating in the desert 32 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Riyadh </LOCATION>, the capital. Built in 1982 as part of a $ 100 million Saudi-U.S. solar research cooperation agreement called Soleras, it is the largest facility of its kind in the world and one of 10 in existence. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> involvement in the project ended two years ago, but <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> solar research continues. <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, the world's largest oil exporter, is hardly desperate for an alternative energy source, but it is trying to lessen its economic dependence on oil. Solar energy is still prohibitively expensive and relatively inefficient. Current technology can convert only about 12 percent of the sun's energy to electricity. Storage of the energy in solar batteries, which last five to seven years, adds about 30 percent to the production costs. But officials at <ORGANIZATION> King </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Abdul-Aziz </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Science </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION>, a quasi-governmental organization that spearheads solar research, are not discouraged. `` We knew it would be expensive at first,'' said <PERSON> Fahad </PERSON> <PERSON> Huraib </PERSON>, the center's solar research program director. `` But most of the money went into research. It helped in promoting this type of technology. To develop an energy source takes from 50 to 100 years.'' The solar village contains a sophisticated solar laboratory, where environmental effects on the efficiency of solar energy can be simulated and measured. The village's original purpose was to use a concentrated photovoltaic system to convert the sun's rays into 350 kilowatts of direct current electricity a day. The beneficiaries are the 4,000 residents of three nearby villages. They received solar-generated electricity for five years, their first source of reliable power. The villages are now hooked into <LOCATION> Riyadh </LOCATION>'s main power grid, which is also suppled by the solar village. Saudi authorities hope that, in time, solar energy will be used to bring electricity to all isolated villages. <PERSON> Huraib </PERSON> said that could encourage people to stay in their villages and help curb mass migration to the cities. In other parts of <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, solar projects are already running. They include a water desalinization plant in the <LOCATION> Red </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> industrial city of <LOCATION> Yanbu </LOCATION>. `` It produces 200 cubic meters -LRB- 52,600 gallons -RRB- of water a day from indirect freezing techniques using solar energy,'' <PERSON> Huraib </PERSON> said. Concentrated heat from the sun produces steam that powers the refrigeration equipment for the system. As seawater is chilled, fresh water crystallizes and forms ice which is then washed and melted. In southern <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, highway tunnels through mountains are illuminated by on-site photovoltaic collectors. <PERSON> Huraib </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> is studying the possibility of lighting all remote tunnels in this manner. The kingdom's giant oil company, <ORGANIZATION> Saudi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aramco </ORGANIZATION>, is using solar energy to provide cathodic protection for some of its pipelines in the eastern province. At the <ORGANIZATION> King </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Abdul-Aziz </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Riyadh </LOCATION>, solar thermal water heaters service all staff housing. <PERSON> Yassen </PERSON> <PERSON> al-Saedi </PERSON>, site manager at the solar village, said that next year the center will begin experimenting with solar-generated irrigation on a half-acre vegetable plot. But the most ambitious of the center's plans is a Saudi-West German research and development project to produce hydrogen through solar energy. `` Hysolar will be the largest project of its kind in the world,'' <PERSON> al-Saedi </PERSON> said. Financed by the center and several West German government organizations, the project will use the solar village's photovoltaic solar generators to produce hydrogen by splitting water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen `` It's the fuel of the future,'' <PERSON> Al-Saedi </PERSON> said. Three major <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> universities are also participating in the research. The plan is to experiment with several possible consumer applications, such as running internal combustion engines and as a fuel cell to produce electricity. <PERSON> Huraib </PERSON> does not rule out the possibility of exporting hydrogen. `` It could be transported through the pipeline as a natural gas,'' he said.

 The members of Flash Cadillac have worked hard for their Ph. Ds in fun `` We've been going to every college in the West for 20 years but never go to class,'' said <PERSON> Kris </PERSON> <PERSON> Moe </PERSON>, the keyboard player. They abandoned the traditional quest for national rock stardom after six miserable years in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, even after hitting gold and platinum with the soundtrack to `` American Graffiti,'' because <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> just is n't their kind of town. `` When we left <LOCATION> Boulder </LOCATION> for <LOCATION> L.A. </LOCATION>, I called my mom,'' said <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Knight </PERSON>, the bass guitar player. `` She said, ` Do what you want to do, but do n't go out there and become one of those people.' We did n't.'' Knight's mom, by the way, has been known to occupy her time protesting nuclear weapons and calling her kids for bail money. So Flash Cadillac left <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> in the mid -'70s and moved back to While they're not getting rich, they're getting by, and just about anybody who attended a college in the <LOCATION> Rocky </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> during the past 20 years knows who they are. So does the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasters </ORGANIZATION>, where Flash recently did a gig, and the <ORGANIZATION> Beach </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Boys </ORGANIZATION>, who've tried to take back a crowd after Flash warmed up. And so does American Bandstand. But getting back to <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> was the band's goal. They, like many other residents of the mountains, figured the tradeoff of less money for a better life was an easy call. `` It's great to spend all day in the recording studio and walk out into paradise instead of on a street corner in <LOCATION> L.A. </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Moe </PERSON> said. Their headquarters is a ranch above <LOCATION> Woodland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Park </LOCATION>, about 30 miles west of <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION> in clear view of <PERSON> Pike </PERSON>'s Peak. They call it <LOCATION> Freedonia </LOCATION>, The Ranch, a name taken from the <PERSON> Marx </PERSON> brothers' movie `` Duck Soup. The place has a main house, extensively remodeled, a trout pond, state-of-the-art recording studio and other homes as well. <PERSON> Moe </PERSON> and <PERSON> Linn </PERSON> <PERSON> Phillips </PERSON> live there, while the other four members live in <LOCATION> Colorado </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Springs </LOCATION> to be closer to offspring. There's a duck or two in the pond and a neighbor grazes some cows on the property. Flash Cadillac used to own livestock _ a cow by the name of <ORGANIZATION> Pot </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roast </ORGANIZATION> _ but ducks and pet fish are easier. The band plays rock' n' roll _ anybody's rock' n roll _ and has a reputation for being about the best party band around. Even <ORGANIZATION> Rolling </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stone </ORGANIZATION> magazine once gave them that honor. They do have fun. They talk of how they really do n't remember what their first official appearance was in 1969 in <LOCATION> Boulder </LOCATION>, because their rehersals were so much fun they ca n't distinguish between those and their stage acts. They made headlines in <LOCATION> Boulder </LOCATION> almost right off the bat when they were banned from that hard-partying college town in 1971. The ban came at a time when the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colorado </ORGANIZATION> was ranked as the nation's top party college by <ORGANIZATION> Playboy </ORGANIZATION> magazine. `` It was n't that we were really gross or out of line, but they decided we did n't put in enough effort to keep things under control,'' <PERSON> Moe </PERSON> said. The band had been playing bar gigs in <LOCATION> Boulder </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Tulagi </PERSON>'s, a saloon of some note in those years, initially booked Flash Cadillac for a `` drown night,'' allowing students to drink unlimited amounts of beer for $ 1.75. A few weeks later, Tulagi's compounded the problem by holding a `` drown night'' the same time as `` gross night,'' and things got out of hand. Police had to be summoned. <ORGANIZATION> CU </ORGANIZATION> grads say there was beer an inch deep in the place. The prizes for the `` no skin, no win'' dance project were, in a word, gross. Flash has cleaned up its act since then, but not the fun quotient. `` That's why we left <LOCATION> L.A. </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Moe </PERSON> said. `` All anybody does out there is spend all day yelling and screaming and arguing. So you waste all your time and they end up calling the shots. They take all of the credit and most of the money. `` If you really want to play music, you have to get away and do it. We were all going nuts in <LOCATION> L.A. </LOCATION>'' <ORGANIZATION> Flash </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cadillac </ORGANIZATION> has n't given up trying for national success. The band is working on a couple of recordings, one aimed at what they believe is a budding country-rock blend suited to their style. `` If we operate at a reasonable regional level, we can stay in business and play music,'' <PERSON> Moe </PERSON> said. `` We're living where we want to live. Go national? Sure, but not at the expense of living in <LOCATION> L.A. </LOCATION> or traveling around the country as an itinerant jukebox.''

 They no longer speak of their task as `` the white man's burden,'' but some missionaries, perhaps influenced by a decade of self-indulgence and national boosterism, are said to be exporting self-righteousness with religion. The organizer of a conference on racism and ethnocentrism among missionaries said mission officials have noticed some evangelists are heading overseas with a diminishing respect for native cultures and beliefs. `` The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> years, I do n't know how else to say it, have lessened the sensitivities and commitment to this,'' said <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Yount </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Churches </ORGANIZATION>. `` We'd thought we'd made some headway into this, but now we're not so sure.'' <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Romero </PERSON>, a mission director for the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christ </ORGANIZATION>, recalled being shocked when a missionary couple referred to Third World people as `` heathens.'' `` To have that terminology used now, I think, is an insult to the religious communities around the world,'' said <PERSON> Romero </PERSON>, general secretary of the mission program of the <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Christ </ORGANIZATION>.

Member churches of the national council had some 4,300 missionaries overseas in 1985, slightly more than 10 percent of the total 43,000 Protestant missionaries, according to <PERSON> Yount </PERSON>. <PERSON> Yount </PERSON>, director of overseas personnel for the council, noted that many early missionaries took stands against colonial authorities and that missionaries have translated the Bible into almost every language and dialect. `` I would stress that the missionary heritage in this is both positive and problematic,'' he said. The conference was called because many mission officials felt the new generation of missionaries lacked sensitivity toward native cultures, <PERSON> Yount </PERSON> said. `` The climate has changed,'' <PERSON> Yount </PERSON> said. `` There is not the more widespread concern about the racism within our own culture, classism within our own culture.'' <PERSON> Romero </PERSON>, however, said he thought it was some older missionaries who `` still carry some overtones of the past in which there is a bit of that white superiority that comes creeping in.'' He recalled, for example, how several such missionaries had joked about the odd names they had encountered overseas, despite being in the presence of natives of those countries. `` I do n't think they had the slightest notion it affected the people sitting there,'' he said. <PERSON> Julie </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, vice president of the Division of Overseas Ministries for the <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- Disciples of Christ -RRB-, said her experience had been different. `` I think the missionaries that the Disciples are sending out today are less racist than the missionaries we were sending out 20 years ago,'' she said. She said many missionaries from her church, appointed for specific terms and specifically invited by overseas organizations, speak not in terms of `` making a tremendous impact'' on the places they visit but of enriching their local churches when they come back. Missionaries who say their only reason for going overseas is that they feel called by God `` are the first people we weed out. It usually means they have a paternalistic attitude,'' she said. <PERSON> Romero </PERSON> sees hope for the future in the recruitment of younger missionaries and more minority missionaries. `` There is great value to having people who have lived with racism, who have lived with oppression in their own countries,'' he said. In addition, churches are adjusting to vast shifts in membership, with congregations swelling in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Latin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> as branches in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> remain merely stable or, in some places, wither. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> noted that the Disciples of Christ will have more members in <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION> than in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> by the year 2000, and that the denomination has cut its corps of overseas missionaries in half, to 110, over two decades. Such changes have prompted new attitudes toward mission work, <PERSON> Yount </PERSON> said. Participants at a recent meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Churches </ORGANIZATION> agreed, he said, that `` if we're really going to have the sending of missionaries, we really need to have the exchange of missionaries.''

<HEAD>Arts Controversy Could Lead to Election-Year Reprisals</HEAD>
<HEAD>An AP News Analysis</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By WALTER R. MEARS</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 After months of controversy and hours of debate, an angry congressional argument over federal art subsidies could boil down to 30 seconds _ the standard length of a campaign ad on television. `` We live in fear of how someone could portray our vote in a 30-second political ad,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON>, D-Wis., who nonetheless voted against sweeping restrictions proposed by Sen. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.C. </LOCATION>, on the use of funds by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Endowment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arts </ORGANIZATION> But for the threat of election-year reprisals, <PERSON> Kohl </PERSON> said, <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>' proposal would n't have been treated as serious business. <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> said the issue was whether taxpayers should be forced to help pay for dirty pictures advertised as art. His opponents said it was censorship versus artistic freedom. As is customary, both sides overstated the case, at great length. `` The definition of art is an issue for the academy, not the legislature,'' Sen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Coats </PERSON>, R-Ind., had said when the issue arose last summer The legislature proved that point. Coats supported the <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> restrictions, saying the question was one of controlling the use of tax dollars, not deciding what is or is n't art But <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> did take a role in that determination 25 years ago, when the art subsidy system was created, although it delegated the job of defining art to panels of experts in the hope it would be insulated against politics. The arts endowment has made about 85,000 grants, and only about 20 had been called into question before. The insulation broke down four months ago over a $ 30,000 <ORGANIZATION> NEA </ORGANIZATION> subsidy to help finance a showing of 150 photographs by <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Mapplethorpe </PERSON>, among them pictures of homosexual acts and of naked children. The exhibit was assembled by a <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> arts group after <PERSON> Mapplethorpe </PERSON> died of AIDS early this year. A second controversy arose over a $ 15,000 grant to another photographer whose works included a picture of a crucifix in a jar of urine. With those incitements, some congressional punishment was inevitable. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> voted to cut a symbolic $ 45,000 out of the $ 171 million NEA budget for next year. They set up a commission to study changes in the way the arts agency decides who should get subsidies. And they voted a ban on federal aid to art that is obscene. The latter provision will make it more difficult for the religious right to proceed with its threat to tell voters that members who voted against the sweeping <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> amendment are on record in support of subsidized pornography. <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> complained last week that the system has the government support artists whose work the taxpayers wo n't support in the marketplace. That's exactly what the system does. Advocates say that is why it is needed. But this argument is not about support for starving artists, it is over government aid to exhibits, in this case photographs, most voters would consider at least vulgar, possibly obscene, in any case offensive. Nobody in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> defended the photographs that stirred the dispute. Defenders of the NEA system called support for those works mistakes in an operation that generally works well. `` We fully recognize that no government can call artistic excellence into existence,'' President <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> said when the agency was created. `` It must flow from the quality of the society and the good fortune of the nation. Nor should any government seek to restrict the freedom of the artist to pursue his calling in his own way.'' The measure was designed to put the artistic decisions in the hands of outside experts, not government. But Sen. <PERSON> Claiborne </PERSON> <PERSON> Pell </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-R.I. </LOCATION>, one of the sponsors of the original act, said <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> meant freedom, not license. The line between the two always has been hard to find. <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> wanted <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to ban arts aid to anything denigrating religion _ or even `` nonreligion'' _ and to works deemed indecent or obscene. Those are difficult words to define, but <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> is a master at reducing complex issues to black and white test votes. When his amendment was adopted on July 26, without a recorded vote, <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> said that any senator who wanted the government funding pornography should vote against him. When it was scrapped in negotiations with the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Helms </PERSON> revived the issue last Thursday night and forced it to a roll call. `` All I wanted was for the senators to look at the pictures and then vote as they please and then answer to the folks back home,'' he said. `` ... Some day, if you vote against this amendment,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON>, D-Vt., who did, `` ... somebody is going to run that 30-second ad and say ` Senator So-and-so supports pornography, Senator So-and-so wants your tax dollars spent on pornography ...'' <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>' amendment was defeated 62 to 35, and a morning-after version was revised into the obscenity ban That leaves an issue and sends a message. From now on, the panels that decide who gets federal arts subsidies are likely to do their erring on the side of caution.

<HEAD>MTV's Colin Quinn Stars in Comedy Special `Back to Brooklyn'</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN HORN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 `` Well, it's not ` Long Day's Journey into Night' or anything.'' Comedian <PERSON> Colin </PERSON> <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON>, the star of <ORGANIZATION> MTV </ORGANIZATION>'s `` <PERSON> Colin </PERSON> <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON> Back to <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>,'' is n't after high art. His comedy special, airing Saturday at 11 p.m. and Sunday at 7:30 p.m., just wants to have fun, any weird way it can. `` Back to <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>'' is composed of a series of sometimes bizarre sketches, most of them mocking pop culture icons. The half-hour show opens with a parody of the pretentious rock documentary `` Rattle and Hum,'' about the Irish band U2. `` The show was a fantasy thing because there was so much freedom in what we could do,'' <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON> said in an interview. `` MTV is not like the networks. They just let you do what you want to do. If you went to a network and said, ` We want to parody `` Rattle and Hum,''' they'd say, ` What's that?' And then they'd say, ` Well the people in so-and-so do n't know what that is.' `` <ORGANIZATION> MTV </ORGANIZATION> is not like that.'' <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON> is one of the co-hosts on `` Remote Control,'' <ORGANIZATION> MTV </ORGANIZATION>'s irreverent, off-the-wall game show that is also a hit in syndication On `` Remote Control,'' <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON> badly sings pop songs that contestants have to finish. In `` Colin's Wheel of Torture,'' another of the game's fixtures, players must undergo such tortures as a Wet Willie -LRB- <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON>'s wet finger is stuck into the player's ear -RRB- to win points. Like `` Remote Control,'' `` Back to <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>'' revels in poking fun at entertainers. The skits include a spoof of a rap rock video and a performance by a combination lounge act-Catholic priest. `` Like the robe?'' the priest says of his vestments. `` Got it at the <LOCATION> Italian </LOCATION> restaurant at the corner. Used to be a tablecloth. Ouch!'' In another brief sketch, <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON> returns to his <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> home, only to be upstaged by an unusual wake for his Uncle <PERSON> Dermott </PERSON>, laid to rest with his glasses on. And in a parody titled `` I Dream of <PERSON> Gina </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON> delivers a fairly accurate but weird imitation of <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Niro </PERSON> as a man convinced his wife is casting magic spells on all the men she meets. `` Everything is getting so serious. There are not enough people out there trying to break down things,'' <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON> said. `` I think audiences are dying for it. I do n't know anybody anymore who watches regular TV and does n't have a lot of complaints about it, saying, ` I ca n't believe how bad it is.' It's like everything getting's so moralistic and formulaic.'' He acknowledged, `` There are a lot of things in this special that people wo n't get. But some people will get some things, and some people will get other things. The beauty is we do n't have to worry about that.'' `` Back to <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>'' is presented with the same false seriousness that has become a trademark of many documentaries these days. `` Basically, what the special is it's me going back to <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION>, coming back in contact with my roots, you know, this kind of thing,'' <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON> says at the show's start. `` My agent did n't want me to do it.'' His fictional talent agent -LRB- played by the show's director, <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Stiller </PERSON> -RRB- is a misguided wheeler-dealer whose clients include diver <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Louganis </PERSON>, actor <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> <PERSON> Cameron </PERSON> and every no-talent in between. The agent's ideas include a new movie based on `` Batman'' and `` Do the Right Thing.'' The title: `` Do the <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Thing </PERSON>,'' where the Boy Wonder is stuck delivering pizzas. `` I just want to do that stuff that's funny. If I could just do a few more of these, that'd be fine,'' <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON> said. `` We hardly even made money on this. But I did n't care. I just want to do good stuff.''

<HEAD>Poverty Politics Misses The Mark</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JOHN CUNNIFF</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Analyst</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 In politics, one of the safest, popular, commendable and perhaps rewarding stances is to be for the poor, especially through government transfer programs. Politically speaking, it is an assumption not to be questioned that transfers of money from the rich to the poor will, over time, improve chances of the poor obtaining a larger percentage of the nation's income. But it might not be so. In that respect, the safe, popular and commendable political stance might also be one of the least effective, says Professor <PERSON> Dwight </PERSON> <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> in a paper for the Center for the Study of <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>'s position will create controversy, but that's what every unpopular notion does in the world of economics. It may be true also that he will never be able to prove the case, but it certainly will get an airing. Indeed, one reason why <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> challenged the assumption was its casual acceptance not just by politicians and economists, but by other segments of economic society and the general public. And the cost, of course, was another reason. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, who teaches at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION>, contends that if government transfer programs were helping the poor then income distribution would have become more equal as spending on poverty programs rose over the years. It has n't happened, he says. He refers to studies showing that income distribution has remained almost stable over the past four decades. He cites one study of income between 1950 and 1970 that showed: _ Households in the lowest 20 percent of income distribution received 6.4 percent of the national net income in 1950 and 6.7 percent in 1970 _ Households in the top 20 percent of income distribution received 39.9 percent of national net income in 1950 and 39.1 percent in 1970 That, says <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, is very little impact for the billions of dollars spent. It is so little, he maintains, that you might also assume that to drastically reduce such spending might do little to worsen poverty. How could this possibly be? He believes the answer lies in the nature of politics and the marketplace. Poverty, he says, is thought to result from a marketplace driven by competition among self-seeking individuals who have little concern for broad social outcomes. If so, he says, the same is true in politics. `` Is it not at least a plausible assumption,'' he asks, `` that people are as self-regarding in one setting as another?'' The political process, like the market process, `` is driven by competition between individuals who are interested in promoting their private objectives,'' he says. Some of those objectives, it seems, do n't always help the poor. Even altruistic people, <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> claims, too often simply lobby for or against existing government programs that provide specific benefits _ rather than the objective of reducing overall poverty. They might see no alternative. Sometimes the poverty advocates are made up of those whose employment is tied to programs, leading him to point out that: `` Poverty professionals have an overriding interest in their incomes and job security and favor the continuation and expansion of funding for poverty programs for reasons completely divorced from any benefits the poor receive.'' In short, as <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> sees it, the motivation in politics is the same as in the marketplace. If elimination of poverty is the goal, few seem interested in determining whether programs do indeed work to reduce poverty. Why do n't the poor themselves have more input? For one thing, the group is always changing; relatively few households remain in poverty for a decade or so. As a political constituency, poverty lacks permanency. The very small percentage of permanently poor, he says, often are incapable of being competitive politically, and for the same reasons they are n't competitive economically. They do n't have the skills, he says.

<TEXT>
 Another kind of combat _ kite fighting _ draws hundreds of Afghans to the fields on the edge of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> on Friday afternoons. They call it `` the game'' and some bet the equivalent of $ 10 _ the monthly wage of a starting government employee _ on the outcome. Kites fly over <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION> all the time, especially in the strong winds that follow a rainstorm. They are the favorite of most children because other toys are too expensive and kites are cheap. All it takes to make a kite are some bright paper, bamboo sticks and string, usually costing a dollar or two. Those who ca n't afford the favored paper from <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> make do with plastic bags. `` School children invented kites,'' said <PERSON> Mohammid </PERSON> <PERSON> Nabi </PERSON> <PERSON> Delaghah </PERSON>, 43, one of the kite sellers around the <PERSON> Shor </PERSON> <PERSON> Bazaar </PERSON> who promote the idea that Afghan children were the first to make kites. Told that other accounts have it that kites originated in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> around the time the Great Wall was being built, he concedes that maybe Afghans only invented fighting with them. `` Two people with kites had a war 90 years ago,'' said <PERSON> Delaghah </PERSON>. `` A guy named <PERSON> Osman </PERSON> <PERSON> Bijo </PERSON> got a medal after he won the fight.'' The rules for `` the game'' call for the competing kites to be the same size with string from the same country _ supposedly to assure that both will be of the same strength. But the specialists say the real strength comes in the amount of crushed glass that is glued onto the string: too much makes it inflexible; not enough makes it weak. `` It's my specialty, but I wo n't show anybody how to make good line,'' said <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> <PERSON> Shareen </PERSON>, a recognized expert on the string. When the kites get 900 to 1,200 feet up, the battle starts with a nod or a shout between the duelers _ men usually in their 30s and 40s. A cry goes up from the spectators: `` They're fighting! They're fighting! A fight takes about 15 minutes. <PERSON> Qari </PERSON> <PERSON> Gholam </PERSON> <PERSON> Samih </PERSON>, 35, said he has not lost a kite in two years of fighting. He said he spent five years just getting ready. The trick, he said, is `` to be brave, to have no fear.'' The real war occasionally intercedes. Last winter a helicopter came roaring over the field and took down about 50 kites. Kites are even part of Afghan literature. A famous short story, `` Word of Honor'' by <PERSON> Akram </PERSON> <PERSON> Osman </PERSON>, made into a movie, centers around a kite maker from the <PERSON> Shor </PERSON> <PERSON> Bazaar </PERSON> who wants to marry his cousin. `` It would've been wonderful if the kites had eyes like yours,'' the kite maker says in the opening scene. The cousin's father, however, opposes the union, keeping his daughter at home and even changing houses when the kite maker successfully lands a kite that says `` Happy Holidays'' into their courtyard. Then the story takes a certain Afghan twist _ the kite maker takes up body building and beats the woman's brother at wrestling. Only then is he allowed to marry the cousin.

<TEXT>
 Nearly two centuries after <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON>'s forces routed them, the Knights of <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> are returning to the island they got from an emperor in exchange for a falcon and ruled for 268 years The `` monks in armor'' will be here Oct. 17-22 for a gathering their leadership hopes will help bolster <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION>'s economy. Officially named the Sovereign Military Order of the <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> John </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jerusalem </ORGANIZATION>, of <PERSON> Rhodes </PERSON> and of <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION>, the knights are the oldest order of chivalry and the fourth oldest religious order in the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>. They ruled this rocky and almost barren <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> archipelago from 1530, when Emperor <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> V </PERSON> gave it to them for the price of one trained falcon a year, until 1798 when <PERSON> Napoleon </PERSON> sent them packing without the treasures they acquired during centuries of plundering the Ottoman Empire. Fra <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Bertie </PERSON>, the 78th grand master of the 900-year-old order, has summoned the knights back and has urged them to help <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> improve its economy. For centuries, membership in the knights required proof of generations of nobility. Although some ranks today are open to those without noble ancestry, the rolls are still crowded with the wealthy and influential. The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> financier <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Grace </PERSON> is a member, as are former <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Secretary of State <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Haig </PERSON>, Premier <PERSON> Giulio </PERSON> <PERSON> Andreotti </PERSON> and President <PERSON> Francesco </PERSON> <PERSON> Cossiga </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Giovanni </PERSON> <PERSON> Agnelli </PERSON>, chairman of the Italian automobile company <ORGANIZATION> Fiat </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Bennett </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> attorney and owner of the <ORGANIZATION> Baltimore </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orioles </ORGANIZATION> major league baseball team who died in August 1988, also was a member. Such men are one reason the order's Maltese association asked <PERSON> Bertie </PERSON> to call the knights back to <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION>, which in 25 years of independence from <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> has found the economic road as rocky as its coastline. <PERSON> Bertie </PERSON>, a long-time former resident of <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION>, encourged knights worldwide to attend the first world gathering of the order and openly solicited their help. `` I also urge those of you who are directly or indirectly interested in facilitating contacts with the development of the economic life of the island to do so,'' <PERSON> Bertie </PERSON> told the knights earlier this year in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Giorgio </PERSON>, president of the Maltese association of the ancient order now based in <LOCATION> Rome </LOCATION>, said about 500 of the 10,000 members are expected to travel to <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION>. `` We want knights from around the world to exchange ideas about our hospital work and to rediscover <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Giorgio </PERSON>. `` During the 268 years the knights were here, they introduced new thinking in architecture, law, medicine and merchant shipping.'' The knights made <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> a thriving center of Christianity and trade. <PERSON> De </PERSON> <PERSON> Giorgio </PERSON> said the knights also gave <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> the legal codes that are the basis for much of its modern law. In 1575, they built and then operated what then was one of the largest hospitals in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. They gave <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION> an architectural heritage of massive fortifications and magnificent palaces and churches. The knights today operate about 200 hospitals and first aid centers in 90 countries, especially in the Third World and war zones. The order was founded in the late 11th century with the opening of a hospice for pilgrims in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>. Its centuries-old dedication to hospital work began when it treated the sick and wounded after the army of the First Crusade captured <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> in 1099. It first took up arms in the 12th century to defend the pilgrim routes to the Holy Land. In the late 13th century, after the Holy Land fell to the Moslems, the knights moved first to <LOCATION> Cyrpus </LOCATION> and then to <LOCATION> Rhodes </LOCATION> where they built a navy to fight the Moslem Ottoman Empire. <PERSON> Sultan </PERSON> <PERSON> Suleiman </PERSON> the Magnificent defeated the knights and forced them to leave <PERSON> Rhodes </PERSON> on Jan. 1, 1523, although with huge losses to his troops. Seven years later, the knights resumed the fight from <LOCATION> Malta </LOCATION>. Once again <PERSON> Suleiman </PERSON> attacked. This time 600 knights, 1,230 mostly Spanish soldiers and about 6,000 Maltese militia defeated an Ottoman army of 40,000. That victory in 1565 marked the beginning of the end for Ottoman seapower and earned the knights the gratitude of a threatened <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.

 More than two centuries after their expulsion by the Spanish crown, <PERSON> Jesuit </PERSON> priests are back in this tropical outpost to champion the rights of Indians and a shrinking wilderness. `` I always try to think in terms of how the Jesuits of 200 years ago would have handled a problem,'' said the Rev. <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON>, a leader in the local Indians' battle with timber companies exploiting the mahogany forests. `` We try to follow that <PERSON> Jesuit </PERSON> heritage in our fight with the woodcutters,'' he told a visiting <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> reporter. `` <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ignacio </LOCATION> is where the Jesuit tradition is best preserved, and where it is replanted in terms of modern problems.'' <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ignacio </LOCATION> de Moxos, on the vast eastern <LOCATION> Bolivian </LOCATION> savannah called the <LOCATION> Beni </LOCATION>, was founded by Jesuits in 1689 as part of the religious order's missionary penetration of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s heartland during <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>'s colonial period At the mission the Jesuits brought 14 Indian communities together in a communal society and taught them weaving, carpentry, cermanics, music and agriculture. They introduced cattle ranching and coffee and peanut farming. One Jesuit priest, <PERSON> Francisco </PERSON> <PERSON> Eder </PERSON>, described the Indians' life in an 18th century book as one of `` peace and tranquility, with an abundance of food and clothing.'' In 1768, the missionaries were forced to abandon <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ignacio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Moxos </LOCATION>, expelled with all members of their order across <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> by a <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> crown that considered their motives and technique subversive. The outpost survived but even now, with 6,000 inhabitants, it remains remote. A dirt road winds northeastward for 270 miles to the capital city of <LOCATION> La </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Paz </LOCATION> high in the Andes mountains. It is impassable in the rainy season and always treacherous. `` This town has become a crossroads for lumbermen, merchants, cocaine traffickers and ranchers,'' <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON>, 50, said. His order returned to <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ignacio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Moxos </LOCATION> in 1982 with three priests. They function from a whitewashed church with elaborately carved altars and furniture painted red, yellow and purple, all dating back to the Jesuits' original stay. They also observe some of the founding traditions, including the annual procession in which a statue of <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ignacio </LOCATION>, the town's patron saint, is carried around the square by the priests, town officials, prominent citizens and Indians of the local Moxo tribe Some Indians wear feather headdresses, wooden masks or other colorful costumes and march to the accompaniment of long bamboo woodwinds, playing a music taught to their ancestors by the original Jesuits. When the ceremony ends, the European-descended townspeople and the Indian descendants go their separate ways. This unofficial but deeply entrenched racial discrimination is as abominable to the Jesuits now as it was in the 1600s, when they were sharply critical of the Spaniards' treatment of Indians. `` There are two worlds in this town,'' <PERSON> Jordan </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON> said. `` They go to school together, but then the whites go to their social club and the Indians go to their social and spiritual center. `` One notices a great deal of discrimination and hostility between the white and Indian communities,'' he said. Many Indians are used as poorly paid laborers by white landowners and merchants. The church has published books and pamphlets detailing the rich cultural heritage of the Moxo Indians and recently helped organize a national conference on tropical forests and Indian rights that attracted hundreds of delegates here. `` The legacy of the Jesuits is a better civilization and for people to care for each other as brothers,'' said <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Coseruna </PERSON>, the 36-year-old president of the Moxo Indian Council. `` The Jesuits are now teaching us how to defend our rights, and to demand better pay,'' he said. `` The white men do n't like the Jesuits because ... before it was easy for the white men to cheat us.'' The government has given seven timber companies rights to the vast forests around <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ignacio </LOCATION>. But in response to a Jesuit-sponsored public campaign, it now is considering a law that would declare part of the wilderness an Indian reservation and regulate the harvest of mahogany and other valuable hardwoods. For years, standard practice has been to remove worthwhile timber then let settlers burn off the rest of the forest for farming, which quickly exhausted the thin layer of topsoil. Left behind are huge tracts of worthless, barren land. `` In 10 years, there will be no forests and animals left,'' <PERSON> Coseruna </PERSON> said. Not all whites resent the return of the Jesuits. They get high praise from <PERSON> Ana </PERSON> <PERSON> Maria </PERSON> <PERSON> Ruiz </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Antelo </PERSON>, 30, president of the town council and member of a prominent cattle-ranching family, who has worked to revive the Indian tradition in handicrafts that languished after the Jesuits were ousted. `` The Jesuits,'' she said, `` have returned to awaken and defend indigenous people because they have nobody else to protect them.''

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Amid the morning rush of commuters, the white Ford Taurus blended well with the hundreds of other cars on <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>'s traffic-clogged six-lane Beltway. But as the sedan passed an 18-wheeler at 60 miles an hour, the driver flicked a switch just below the dashboard and the Taurus became like no other car on the busy highway. It was now running on propane instead of gasoline. As <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> moves toward enacting tougher laws to combat urban pollution and other environmental concerns, including global warming, the word is out: The 1990s may well become the decade in which the alternative-fuel automobile with its fewer pollutants will challenges the conventional gasoline-powered car. President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has proposed legislation calling for a phase-in of thousands of alternative-fuel vehicles beginning in 1995 and for production of at least 1 million such cars a year by 1997 in urban areas with the worst smog. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, says there is no other way to attain a significant reduction in urban smog and still acknowledge Americans' love of their automobiles than to phase in large numbers of cars that use cleaner fuels than gasoline. As a result, there has been a rush to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> by almost every conceivable maker and promoter of alternative fuels in an attempt to carve out a niche in that yet-to-be-defined future market of motor vehicles. The parking lots on Capital Hill were dotted one day recently with vehicles powered by various fuels from propane to hydrogen. Among then were: _ A transit bus with a specially designed engine powered by natural gas _ A <ORGANIZATION> Mercedes-Benz </ORGANIZATION> sedan powered by an experimental solar-hydrogen system _ Vehicles from beer and pizza trucks to mid-size sedans all fueled by propane The propane-powered sedans _ including the white Taurus _ were equipped with duel-fuel systems that allowed with a touch of a switch to shift from unleaded gasoline to propane, even at highway speeds, with hardly a notice. But the alternative fuel most talked about for passenger cars _ and cited specifically by <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> _ is methanol, a liquid that comes from methane, the main component of natural gas. Methanol is in large supply, requires no pressurization and could be dispensed from service station pumps alongside those offering gasoline. Methanol has been so widely discussed that producers of other alternative fuels have sent their representatives to <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> to complain that it is the only substitute fuel the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> and the White House are interested in. `` What we're striving for with the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> and the legislative -LRB- lobbying -RRB- is a level playing field,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Meyers </PERSON>, executive vice president for marketing at <ORGANIZATION> Petrolane </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the country's largest retailer of propane He said there is clear evidence of a `` bias'' toward methanol in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Top <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> officials do tilt toward methanol and <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> counsel <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyden </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> has made no secret of his views on the fuel. He has been driving a Chevrolet Citation that runs on alcohol for several years. `` Many people have portrayed the administration as being dominated by methanol junkies,'' <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s director of congressional liaison, told a propane industry group, insisting that such a characterization is not true. In an interview, <PERSON> Quinn </PERSON> acknowleged that methanol appears to be a `` fuel of choice'' as an alternative to gasoline for most passenger cars. But he said the agency plans to establish pollution standards for other fuels as well and envisions both propane and compressed natural gas as eventually gaining significant niches, especially in such areas as fleet vehicles and transit buses. There already are an estimated 350,000 propane-powered vehicles in use nationwide, almost exclusively in fleet operations. Among them are more than 250 taxis in <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>, 160 school buses in <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION>, sheriff's department cars in <LOCATION> Sarasota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, and a variety of delivery trucks. Propane has been used in farm vehicles for years. But propane still is primarily used for heating, with only about 3 percent of sales going to vehicles. `` What we see now is a golden opportunity -LRB- for expansion -RRB-. The niche we see is really in the fleet industry,'' says <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmitt </PERSON>, a marketing consultant for <ORGANIZATION> Ferrellgas </ORGANIZATION>, a major propane retailer. But all this talk of substitute fuels for gasoline has not escaped notice of the petroleum industry. <ORGANIZATION> Atlantic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Richfield </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> recently announced it would begin offering a reformulated, cleaner-burning leaded gasoline for older cars. Other oil companies reportedly are developing cleaner-burning unleaded gasoline and plan soon to put them in test markets in light of the expected tighter air pollution standards being debated in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. Meanwhile, the oil industry has unleashed a public relations assault on methanol, including newspaper ads saying that it is highly toxic and even small amounts could be fatal if swallowed; that it releases formaldehyde, an ozone-causing and probably carcinogenic pollutant; and that it would likely be more expensive than gasoline. The <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> responded with a report on methanol saying that the fuel remains a sound alternative, that its expected price will be competitive with gasoline and that its safety risks are no greater than with other fuels, including gasoline.

<HEAD>Nissan Axxess: Two Sliding Doors Make It a Dream for Parents</HEAD>
<HEAD>With LaserPhoto, LaserGraphic</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ANN M. JOB</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>For The Associated Press</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Good news for harried parents of toddlers. The 1990 <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Axxess </ORGANIZATION> minivan is especially for you. The Axxess is the first small van with a sliding passenger door on each side of the vehicle, and that makes it easy for parents to extricate little ones from the back seat. Forget about folding yourself in two and climbing inside to get at the kids. With the Axxess' handy doors, you can just reach in from either side. Imagine how this could cut down on wailing time. And no need to worry about the young ones opening the doors as you drive. Both doors are fitted with child-proof locks that allow opening only from the outside. This vehicle also should appeal to buyers who want the versatility of a van and the safety of a car; as <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> notes, the Axxess is the first minivan that meets safety standards for passenger cars. Vans are categorized as trucks under federal regulations and therefore need not meet the more rigid car safety The Axxess, however, has 5-mph bumpers, a high-mounted rear brake light, side-door beams for protection in side crashes, passive seatbelts up front and three-point seat belts in back _ all standard equipment. Although available in front-drive mode, the <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Axxess </ORGANIZATION> offers even better traction with its all-wheel-drive version, which was the test vehicle. In a sudden thunderstorm, the Axxess all-wheel-drive offered surefooted control and peace of mind. Because of its size _ bigger than a sedan but smaller than other minivans _ the vehicle also maneuvered easily. The all-wheel-drive test model was powered by the standard 2.4-liter, four-cylinder engine that produced 138 horsepower and was paired with a four-speed automatic overdrive transmission. The Axxess would n't win acceleration derbies, and I noticed a couple of jerks as I put it through some paces and the transmission sought the right gear. But the fuel economy of 18 mpg in the city and 22 mpg on the highway is close to that of other, two-wheel-drive minivans. For example, <ORGANIZATION> Mazda </ORGANIZATION>'s MPV with automatic transmission is rated at 19 mpg in the city and 24 mpg on the highway, while the Plymouth Voyager automatic with four-cylinder engine gets 21 mpg in the city and 23 mpg on the highway. <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> expects Axxess buyers to fit the young family profile. The targeted median age for buyers is the mid-30s, and they are likely to have some college education. With a household income of around $ 38,000, they will be on a fairly tight budget, said company spokesman E.C. <PERSON> Mueller </PERSON>. `` They're not looking for something faddish, they want quality and style,'' he said. `` <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> wanted to give them something that's comfortable, fun to drive, where you do n't feel you're stuffed in a box. That's why the Axxess has so much glass. The dashboard area is expansive, and there are even tiny windows alongside the curving dash. The sunroof on the test model added a feeling of space, as did the headrests with holes cut in the middle. I noted, however, that all that glass lets in a lot of sunlight and could quickly make for a hot interior on 90-degree summer days. That's where the air conditioning came in handy. The test vehicle had seating for seven. But rather than the typical minivan arrangement where two people sit in the middle and three in the back, the Axxess had a three-passenger seat in the middle and a two-passenger bench in back. To reach the rear-most seat, you must fold forward the seatback at one end of the middle seat, then lift the entire folded middle seat forward against the front seat. It took a little getting used to but worked well once I got the hang of it. The rear door opened easily and offered access to a space behind the third seat big enough for several grocery bags. To get more cargo room, you must remove the rear seat headrests, flip the seat cushion forward and the rear seatback down. That, too, took a little practice. Minimum legroom for the rear-most seat made this position best-suited for children. The middle seat was better, although the backs of the front seats still hit my legs if they were pushed all the way back and reclined a bit. <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> expects <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> sales of about 18,000 in the 1989 and 1990 model years combined. The Axxess made its <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> debut in late March, and sales through the first six months totaled more than 2,000. The Axxess has been sold as the Prairie in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> since September 1988. Because the Axxess is a new vehicle, Consumer Reports magazine does not list an owner's trouble report.

 <PERSON> Harold </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> is a busy billionaire, but he needs to be to reach his goal of leaving more money for medical research than <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>. `` Money brings a lot of responsibility as to what you're going to do with it, and I've given quite a bit of thought to that,'' <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> said in an interview during which he gave a rare insight into the thoughts and actions of one of the nation's wealthiest investors. `` Basically my decisions have been largely to funnel most of the funds that I have available for discretionary giving to medical research,'' said <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>, who suffers from arthritis, a painful inflammation of the joints. Last year, he gave $ 41 million to the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> for cancer and arthritis research and his goal is to at least match the <ORGANIZATION> Howard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hughes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>, the reclusive industrialist who died in 1976, had created the institute 23 years earlier and given it sole ownership of <ORGANIZATION> Hughes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aircraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co </ORGANIZATION>. In the mid-1980s, the institute sold <ORGANIZATION> Hughes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aircraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> to </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> for $ 5.2 billion. Today, the institute's endowment is about $ 6.5 billion, making it the nation's largest private philanthropic foundation. `` I wo n't cry if I do n't make it, or I wo n't boast if I get over that,'' <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> said. `` I think that's a nice round figure. It's realistic. <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON>, 58, is well on his way, increasing his wealth at an average of almost $ 14 million a month in the 12 years since he cashed the stock he received from selling his <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> drug store chain to <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Eckerd </PERSON> <PERSON> Corp </PERSON>. He began the chain with $ 5,000 in cash and a $ 95,000 loan to buy a drug store near <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Methodist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. Through a series of acquisitions, he built up to 100 stores before selling to <ORGANIZATION> Eckerd </ORGANIZATION> for stock worth an estimated $ 50 million. Restrictions on that stock, however, prevented him from selling immediately. The stock had declined to about $ 12 million before he could unload it. With that $ 12 million, the son of two rural <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> school teachers has built a fortune bumping $ 2 billion through a combination of takeovers and stock plays involving some of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION>'s biggest companies. Lately, <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> has become a more public figure, granting interviews and disputing his past image among some of his targets as a bad guy. `` I do n't think I have a black hat image,'' he said. `` I think that I'm certainly feared and dreaded, and maybe not highly regarded by management of public companies that do n't own very much stock in the company. `` I'm not trying to change an image, I'm just trying to make sure that the facts match the image. The facts are basically that I'm a builder. I have not dissembled any company nor split up any companies, nor do I ever buy any companies with that intent.'' While other high-stakes investors are either dormant or prowling overseas, <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> has at least two major plays under way. He continues to buy stock in <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, now holding more than 10 percent, and is awaiting <ORGANIZATION> Georgia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gulf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> management's response to his almost 10 percent stake in the company. `` I think the thing that I've done well, the thing that I've been able to make money on, is simply evaluating the public information ... of public companies,'' <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> said `` And based on that information, I've made some decisions and taken some actions that have resulted in most of my wealth, so I think that's what I have a talent for. It's a fairly narrow talent, and you're not always right.'' <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> claims to be lazy, arriving at the office late and leaving early. He also likes to play tennis, ride dirt bikes and fly in his private jet, although in person he displays none of that energy. Instead, he barely moved during an interview at his <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> office, discussing in subdued tones his life as corporate takeover strategist and unabashed capitalist. Since 1977, <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> has bought and sold stock in 16 companies, taking profits of $ 328.9 million, holding the stock from as short as a month to as long as three years. His biggest absolute gain came in 1987 when he sold his 17.9 percent stake in <ORGANIZATION> GAF </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> for $ 197.9 million three years after investing $ 58 million. <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> denies he has ever been a greenmailer. `` Greenmail is when you threaten a company and you go sell your stock to the company so they'll get rid of you and nobody else gets to sell their stock,'' <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> said, whereas all stockholders benefit from his activity. `` I definitely have a shareholders' perspective,'' <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> said. `` I'm not doing that altruistically. I'm doing that because it's in my own self interest to do it. I think that's good for my other shareholders because they go along with me: If I do well for myself, then they do well for themselves.'' <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> also has kept a fair share of his holdings, the most valuable stemming from his 1986 purchase of <ORGANIZATION> NL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> for about $ 300 million. The investment now is worth an estimated $ 1.2 billion. Another key play was the 1982 buyout of <ORGANIZATION> Amalgamated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sugar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in a $ 35 million deal. He later sold an unprofitable joint venture for $ 30 million giving him a total cost of about $ 5 million for the company. He said he recently turned down more than $ 330 million in cash for the sugar beet processor. <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> said his decisions to keep or sell, and whether to take a company private or leave it public are based on money. `` If I had all the money in the world, I would n't have any public companies. The minority interest in <ORGANIZATION> NL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> would cost about $ 650 million to $ 700 million ... so I've got to evaluate that alternative vs. the alternative of just buying something else. In this case, my decision is to leave the minority interest in there. Let them be partners, let them prosper if I do.'' As for operating a company, `` I very seldom buy, take a major stock position in, any company that I would not be willing to buy all that company at the price I'm paying for it,'' <PERSON> Simmons </PERSON> said. `` Many people think you just decide there's a company you want to buy, period, and you want to buy it regardless of what it costs. I do n't. `` I want to buy a company if I can buy it for what I think is less than it's worth to me,'' he said. `` If it gets higher than that, I'll sell.''

<HEAD>CEO Survey: Most Top Corporate Execs Conservative, White Men</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By VIVIAN MARINO</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The typical top corporate executive is a conservative, white, <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION> male, with a traditional family life and a military background, according to a nationwide survey. The survey by the <ORGANIZATION> Wall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Journal </ORGANIZATION> also found that corporate leaders believe their business practices are more ethical now than a decade ago, generally would hesitate to promote a homosexual to management level and believe it's lonely at the top. The survey looks at the personal lives and habits of 351 chief executive officers of the nation's biggest companies and offers a profile of who's running corporate <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. Detailed results will be published this month in `` The Wall Street Journal Book of Chief Executive Style.'' The typical profile of a successful chief is a conservative one, according to the survey. Results were based partly on interviews with the chief executives by a team of Journal reporters over the past year. Most of the nation's corporate honchos have three children, have been married to the same stay-at-home woman for 20 years and have served in the armed forces, according to the survey. One in four grew up in the <LOCATION> Mid-Atlantic </LOCATION> states of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>. They're mostly college educated but only 35 percent have masters degrees, and 12.5 percent earned doctorates _ generally at a non-Ivy League school. About 5 percent have no degree at all, like <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Lazarus </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Toys </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> R </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Us </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Howard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sells </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> F.W </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Woolworth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> or <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Davis </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Amerada </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hess </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The CEOs usually work 10 to 12 hours a day, plus weekends, and take at least three weeks of vacation each year, usually in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. Only 2.8 percent of those surveyed took no vacation in 1986. An overwhelming majority, 71 percent, believe that in general CEOs of major corporations are more ethical in their business practices today than they were 10 years ago. Reflecting their apparent conservatism, some 66 percent said they would hesitate to promote a homosexual to management-committee level. Although the survey dealt with weighty questions such as ethics and minority promotions, the Journal book makes only a brief mention of those issues. <PERSON> Norm </PERSON> <PERSON> Pearlstein </PERSON>, editor-in-chief of the Journal, said those issues were not explored further because the thrust of the book was on CEO lifesytles and working habits. Despite their salaries and perks, the executives say their everyday behavior in many areas tends to be similar to that of the average, middle-class <PERSON> Joe </PERSON>. <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Munro </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Time </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> commutes to work in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> every day on the crowded 6:02 a.m. train out of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canaan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, an area where many CEOs live to avoid the income taxes of neighboring <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. He also speaks fondly of the pleasures derived from mowing his own lawn. <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> admits that he likes to eat fast food with the masses. `` Sure we go to <ORGANIZATION> McDonald </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION>. I like <PERSON> McDonald </PERSON>'s hamburgers,'' he says. But socializing with subordinates is another story. Many said that after they made it to the top they felt limited in the number of personal relationships they could maintain, preferring to socialize with other chief executives. `` If you're socializing with one executive and not others, you're sending messages to those you do n't see that they should not be getting,'' said <ORGANIZATION> DuPont </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Irving </PERSON> <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON>. CEOs tend to meet each other at private clubs, where they're likely to dine on seafood instead of red meat and drink as much wine as they do scotch About 92 percent of those surveyed said they drink, but only 3 percent will imbibe at lunch. Although 59 percent play golf, only 6 percent cited it as their favorite sport. For clothing, navy blue suits, white shirts and red power ties were the surveyed executives' preferred attire. Black pinstripe suits, paisley ties and pink, pastel and yellow shirts are least favored. Many CEOs also have their own brand of `` diplomatic doubletalk,'' the survey says. For example, `` Let me know if I can help,'' could be translated to, `` Do n't bother me.'' And, `` My door is always open,'' may mean, `` You can try to see me, but it will cost you some respect and brownie points.''

 <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> has announced software for supercomputers based on a patented breakthrough by a mathematician at <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> T </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> T </ORGANIZATION> introduced its own package of hardware and software based on the so-called <LOCATION> Karmarkar </LOCATION> algorithm last year and it appears that <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>'s entry Tuesday puts the two technology giants in direct competition. An <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> press release made no mention of <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T and simply said that part of its software's power `` stems from a new programming method which drew worldwide attention when it was introduced a few years ago.'' <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Denis </PERSON> <PERSON> Arvay </PERSON>, who mentioned the <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T connection, said <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> was entitled to use the <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T patent through a cross-licensing agreement between the companies. <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T spokesman <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> said he could not find anyone at <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T who knew of the <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> product and thus the company had no comment on it. The Karmarkar algorithm, invented in 1984 by <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T's <PERSON> Narendra </PERSON> <PERSON> Karmarkar </PERSON>, is a programming method for solving resource-allocation problems that involve huge numbers of variables, such as scheduling daily crew assignments for a major airline. <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> said its software was able to obtain the best solution to an airline scheduling problem in less time than a <ORGANIZATION> Cray </ORGANIZATION> 2 supercomputer from <ORGANIZATION> Cray </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> reportedly took to solve a problem one-tenth the size. <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>'s software, known as the Optimization Subroutine Library, runs on big 3090 mainframe computers that have add-on equipment to make them work as supercomputers. But <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> said versions of it can run on smaller <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> computers, even its personal computers. The chief creators of <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>'s software were <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Tomlin </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Almaden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jose </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Forrest </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Thomas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> J. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Watson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Yorktown </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heights </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T's hardware-software product, Korbx, was introduced in August 1988 at a price of $ 8.9 So far there are two customers willing to have their names publicized, the <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlift </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>.

 Former Secretary of State <PERSON> Alexander </PERSON> <PERSON> Haig </PERSON> and former <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker Tip O'Neill do n't usually see eye to eye, but they do agree on the benefits of flying the Trump Shuttle, according to a new advertising campaign. <PERSON> Haig </PERSON> and <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON> are one of several odd couples seated together in the television and newspaper ads for the Northeast airline.

Trump Shuttle, which developer <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Trump </PERSON> bought from strikebound <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> in early June and renamed, has been in a fierce battle for market share with the rival shuttle run by <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Am </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>.

 <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, are the best metropolitan areas in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> businesses, according to rankings in a Fortune magazine survey. The business biweekly said Tuesday it ranked the top 10 of the nation's largest metro areas based on such factors as labor force, cost of doing business, economic base, infrastructure and quality of life. <LOCATION> Dallas-Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> emerged on top based on its 28 percent commercial real estate vacancy rate, large pool of `` talented workers,'' surging population and active night life. `` The so-called Metroplex, embracing the suburbs and the area between the cities, is today's dream location for business, largely because of surplus office and factory space in the wake of the oil bust,'' <PERSON> Fortune </PERSON> said. The survey results appear in the Oct. 23 issue of the magazine, which hits newsstands on Wednesday. The ratings were based on the magazine's opinions and a statistical profile compiled by the corporate location consultants <ORGANIZATION> Moran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stahl </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Boyer </PERSON>, <PERSON> Fortune </PERSON> said. It also factored in the opinions of chief executives of big companies as compiled by business real estate firm <ORGANIZATION> Cushman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <LOCATION> Wakefield </LOCATION>. Among the statistical factors were labor supply growth since 1983, rate of growth in taxes, government bond ratings and local government debt per capita. Fortune said No. 2 <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> rated highly because of its appearance, low salaries and other business costs, and because it has available land for expansion. Drawbacks included a high cost of living and high crime rate. <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> scored for its fountains, museums, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> houses and midtown Country Club Plaza shopping area, as well as good center city housing and an ample supply of technical and professional labor.

 <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> says it will make available a program that checks for viruses in personal computers, responding in part to customer worries about an impending attack. News reports about the so-called Datacrime virus, which is programmed to attack after Oct. 12, have caused widespread alarm even though experts say the virus is rare and a relatively small number of personal computers will be harmed. `` Up until the recent press hype, our customers had not expressed any tremendous interest over and above what we already do in terms of security products and awareness,'' said <PERSON> Art </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION>'s manager of secure systems industry support. Small companies in the anti-virus field expressed support for the step Tuesday by the world's largest computer maker. `` It's about time one of the big boys realized what a problem this is and did something about it. To date, all the anti-virus activity is being done by the mom and pops out there,'' said <PERSON> Ross </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenberg </PERSON>, a New York-based consultant and author of Flu-Shot Plus. `` It's a very important and responsible step,'' said <PERSON> Pamela </PERSON> <PERSON> Kane </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Panda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Systems </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Wilmington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Del. </LOCATION>, and author of a new book, `` Virus Protection.'' <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> said its IBM Virus Scanning Program for computers that run <ORGANIZATION> Microsoft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s DOS base-layer software would spot three strains of the Datacrime virus as well as more common viruses that go by such names as the <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Lehigh </ORGANIZATION>, Bouncing Ball, <ORGANIZATION> Cascade </ORGANIZATION> and Brain. The program is available for $ 35 directly from <ORGANIZATION> IBM </ORGANIZATION> or from dealers, marketing representatives and remarketers. <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> said the program will detect but not eradicate viruses. Some other companies say they have products that will eradicate viruses, although others say such programs are not reliable. <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> said installing a virus checker is not a substitute for safe-computing practices such as making backup copies of programs and data and being cautious about software of unknown origin. The Datacrime virus cripples personal computers' hard disks, where programs and data are stored, by wiping out the directory sections known as the partition table and file allocation table. Experts who have dismantled copies of the virus say it is set up to attack computers when their internal calendars go past Oct. 12, the traditional date for Columbus Day.

<HEAD>Timberland Investments Touted as Hedge Against Inflation</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GORDON FAIRCLOUGH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW HAVEN, Conn. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Timberland is drawing increased attention from investors who are rediscovering its value as a relatively low-risk investment that provides a good hedge against inflation, experts say. `` There is a growing interest by non-traditional investors in timberlands _ pension funds and individuals _ who are looking at timber as another asset to diversify their portfolios,'' said <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Binkley </PERSON>, a professor at <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s forestry and business schools. `` The conventional wisdom -LRB- has been -RRB- that timber stands are risky investments because of forest fires, insect infestations and a volatile demand linked to fluctuations in the housing market,'' <PERSON> Binkley </PERSON> said. `` But the reality is that you can store timber on the stump until demand goes up and only a miniscule percentage will be lost to fires and disease.'' Because timberland does not tend to fall prey to the same market forces as stocks and bonds, <PERSON> Binkley </PERSON> said, it can be a useful tool in building a diversified portfolio. Investments in timber also can offer comparable rates of return to stocks and bonds with considerably less risk, he said. Southern pine timberland, for example, has had an annual return of about 10 percent since 1955. Investors are being drawn to timberland because of `` the diversification and low risk coupled with what we consider very good returns,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON>, the Atlanta-based vice president and manager of timberland for <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wachovia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION>, a division of the <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wachovia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON> said that pension funds have invested $ 600 million to $ 700 million in timberland. While some pension funds, like <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s, own thousands acres on their own, most of these non-traditional investors join with other investors in timberland investment funds. The largest fund is run by <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hancock </PERSON>, the Boston-based insurance and financial services company. Other insurance companies, including Mutual of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, also manage timber funds, as does <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wachovia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, which is based in <LOCATION> Winston-Salem </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wachovia </ORGANIZATION> runs the country's only open-ended fund, which allows investors to increase or decrease the size of their investments and allows new investors to join each quarter. Other funds are closed-ended, with participants investing a fixed amount and remaining committed to the fund until a pre-set maturation date. <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wachovia </ORGANIZATION>'s fund has seven investors and owns about 33,000 acres of forest in <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Chambers </PERSON> said. He said he expects `` substantial growth'' over the next three to five years for timberland funds as they become more accepted by pension fund managers. <PERSON> Binkley </PERSON>, a forestry professor who also has an appointment at <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION>, has been working to quantify the risks involved in timber investments. `` We need to be able to explain timberland to potential investors in exactly the same terms as stocks, bonds and other investments,'' he said in a recent interview. <PERSON> Binkley </PERSON> said his research shows that <LOCATION> Maine </LOCATION> timberland presents the least risk to investors, while Southern woodland is slightly more risky and timberland in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION> is the most risky. Investments in <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Northwest </LOCATION> timberland seem to be the most volatile because of the federal government's controls on the sale of timber there. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> sets sales levels for timber in the region every year, so lumber prices are not simply a function of market forces, <PERSON> Binkley </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Binkley </PERSON> said, however, that as risk increases, so does the potential for investment return. `` I'm not saying that every individual or pension fund manager should rush to invest in timber. I am trying to provide the tools they can use to assess whether the investment is right for them,'' he said.

<TEXT>
 Troubled <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, striving to rebuild as a smaller carrier, has received permission to dip into $ 75 million held in escrow and to sell a $ 30 million note that it owns. At a hearing Tuesday, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Bankruptcy Judge <PERSON> Burton </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lifland </PERSON> granted <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s request to use the $ 75 million, which came from asset sales, to help run its operations through the end of the year. Miami-based <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, which was struck by its unions and filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in early March, is selling about $ 1.8 billion in jets, routes and other assets. In a separate action Tuesday, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> voted to cut off debate on long-stalled legislation that would require creation of a commission to investigate and recommend solutions to the Eastern strike, which has entered its eighth month. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON>, the court-appointed bankruptcy examiner for Eastern, told <PERSON> Lifland </PERSON> he supported <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s request for the funds on the grounds that it needed the cash to keep operating. After the $ 75 million is withdrawn, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> will have about $ 300 million left in escrow from which to repay its creditors or cover operating expenses. The $ 75 million is necessary for and will be sufficient to support <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s fourth-quarter operations, said <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Zirinsky </PERSON>, an attorney for the airline. He reiterated the company's assertion that it is exceeding the financial projections made in an operating plan it released in April. In July, <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> asked for $ 100 million from the escrow account for running operations in the third quarter. <PERSON> Lifland </PERSON> agreed to the release of $ 75 million at that time. <PERSON> Lifland </PERSON> also ruled Tuesday that <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> could sell an unsecured $ 30 million note that it acquired in 1986 from sister carrier <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. The note was originally issued by now-defunct <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, a no-frills carrier that was absorbed by <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>. The judge also postponed until Dec. 15 a hearing on the unions' request for a special trustee to be appointed to run Eastern in place of current management Consideration of the request by the Eastern pilots, <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union members and flight attendants has been put off several times by the judge. <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON> requested that the trustee issue be postponed until he can finish an in-depth financial investigation of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> and their parent <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Shapiro </PERSON> said he and more than 20 associates are interviewing current and former officers of the companies, union leaders and others The examiner told the judge he expected to complete the investigation by early December, and said his schedule has been delayed several times by lawyers for the parties involved. <PERSON> Bruce </PERSON> <PERSON> Simon </PERSON>, an attorney for the pilots union, which supports appointment of a trustee, said there was `` informal talk'' that the investigation could take until next spring. <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> Zweibel </PERSON>, a lawyer representing the committee of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>'s major creditors, said that group did not believe a trustee should be named at this time Also Tuesday, <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Investors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> said it had lowered its credit ratings on securities issued by <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION>, reflecting the `` high leverage, weak debt protection and decreasing financial flexibility of the parent and its subsidiaries.'' The credit-rating agency said <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>'s ability to support <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> has been diminished by the bankruptcy of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION>, its other main subsidiary.

<HEAD>Automakers Expect Tighter Market in 1990</HEAD>
<HEAD>Eds: Lead prospects uncertain.</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By FREDERICK STANDISH</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Auto Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>DETROIT (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 As the 1990 model year debuts, automakers are predicting a smaller <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> car and truck market, more players in it and the likelihood of more buyer incentives. Nearly 80 million vehicles have been sold during the last five model years in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, or nearly one new car or truck for every three people in the country. There has been some concern that the market has been saturated. But demand that flagged during the 1989 model year, which officially ended Saturday, may get a boost in the 1990 model year as the vehicles on the road get older and closer to trade-in time. `` A lot of pessimists love to make the statement that we seem to be selling cars at a pretty brisk clip for eight years now and who needs a new car?'' said analyst <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Oppenheimer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` If we replace just one of three of the cars 10 years or older, we'd sell 10 million vehicles,'' he said Final sales figures, due out today, probably will show that just under 15 million cars and trucks were sold during the 1989 model year. Experts predict that figure wo n't be reached this model year. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, vice president and general manager of the <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> Division of <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> U.S.A. </LOCATION>, this week predicted 14 million vehicles will be sold this year. <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> is on the high side of 1990 predictions at about 15 million, a slight change from the 1989 model year. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> expects about 14.2 million vehicles will be sold in the 1990 model year, while <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> has said the figure will be lower than the 14.8 million it believed were driven off dealership lots in the 1989 model year. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> has declined to make a formal prediction for 1990 sales. During the past year, about two cars were sold for every truck, and analysts predict that ratio will remain about the same, or perhaps lean a little heavier toward trucks. Like <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION>, analyst <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Merlis </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stanley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> is forecasting 14 million cars and trucks will be sold in the 1990 model year if incentives remain constant. He said that without the rebates that stretched through much of 1989, automakers would have sold 1 million fewer vehicles. `` That would have been an 11 percent drop instead of a 5 percent drop,'' he said, referring to the 15.8 million vehicles sold during the 1988 model year, the third best year in auto history. As the size of the market shrinks, the number of models offered continues to grow. In the popular minivan segment, <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> is introducing a trio of models _ its first minivans with front wheel drive _ that <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> admits will dent its dominance of that market. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> is striking back in part with an upscale version of its vans. On the luxury end of the car market, Japanese companies are introducing two new lines to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> this model year. <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION>'s Infiniti and <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION>'s Lexus are marketing two cars each, ranging in price from just over $ 20,000 to nearly $ 40,000. <ORGANIZATION> Jaguar </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> also is introducing a new car to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market, priced lower than its others at $ 39,700. On the less-expensive end of the market, <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Chevrolet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Division </ORGANIZATION> is heavily promoting its Geo line of three cars and a sport-utility vehicle made either entirely or partly by Japanese companies. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s dated Omni-Horizon models will continue, but with less marketing emphasis, while <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> will introduce its new generation of Escort-Tracer cars in mid-1990.

<HEAD>FTC Accepts Tobacco Firm's Settlement on False Advertising Claim</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> R.J. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reynolds </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> has settled a federal false advertising claim by agreeing `` not to misrepresent in future advertisements'' the results of a study that linked smoking and heart disease. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> was divided 3-1 over accepting the settlement, which was termed `` conspicuously weak'' by the dissenter, Commissioner <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Azcuenaga </PERSON>. She said the acceptance `` demonstrates a modicum of interest, at most, in important issues related to smoking and health'' and indicates a double standard for deceptive advertising and lenient treatment for Reynolds. Commissioner <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Strenio </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> defended the agreement, calling it `` both justified and commensurately strong.'' He said it provides `` appropriate disincentives'' against recurrence of the allegedly unfair and deceptive claims. In a statement, the tobacco firm said Tuesday it remains convinced its advertising message `` constituted an exercise of free speech'' but that it felt there was no purpose in continuing its fight with the <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION>. `` We have decided therefore to accept a settlement that puts the matter behind the company,'' <PERSON> R.J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> complained that a Reynolds advertisement made false and misleading claims about a long-term study funded by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>. `` <PERSON> Reynolds </PERSON>' advertisement falsely claimed that -LRB- the study -RRB- provided scientific evidence that smoking is not as hazardous as the public has been led to believe,'' the <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> complaint said. Also, said the <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION>, the ad falsely maintained that the study `` tends to refute the theory that smoking causes heart disease.'' The consent agreement is not an admission that the law was violated and it can become final, after more commission debate, after a 60-day comment period by the public. Commission chairman <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Steiger </PERSON> did not vote on the order.

 Two Texans credited with revolutionizing electronics with their co-invention of the semiconductor microchip were named the first winners of the Charles Stark Draper Prize, the world's largest award given exclusively for engineering achievement. <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kilby </PERSON>, chief technical officer of the <ORGANIZATION> Houston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Area </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, and <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Noyce </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Sematech </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION>, will share a $ 350,000 cash award and each will receive a gold medal, officials announced Tuesday. The Draper prize, awarded for the first time this year, is directed by the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineering </ORGANIZATION>, a private organization affiliated with the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION>. The prize will be awarded every two years. `` We believe that the <PERSON> Draper </PERSON> prize will focus world attention on the important contributions of engineers in the same way that the Nobel Prize now focuses attention on the accomplishemnts of scientists,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Engineering </ORGANIZATION>. White said <PERSON> Kilby </PERSON> and <PERSON> Noyce </PERSON> are credited with the independent, co-invention of the single crystal microchip. The microchip has led to a revolution in electronics and has become a vital component in machines used in communications, manufacturing, transportation and computing. `` Very few things have changed the world as dramatically as the integrated circuit,'' <PERSON> White </PERSON> said. `` Like the invention of the telephone, the light bulb, or the automobile, the creation and widespread practical application of the integrated circuit has fundamentally changed our lives.'' The microchip is used in electronic circuits that are at the heart of such equipment as calculators, digital watches, telephones, automatic cameras, personal computers, compact discs and in the electronics of satellites, airplanes and military weapons. Before the microchip was invented in the 1950s, electronic circuits depended on transistors, resistors and capacitors that had to be soldered and wired together to create a desired function. Microchips, however, are made from a single silicon crystal and the functions of thousands of electronic components can be built into a chip about the size of a matchhead. <PERSON> Noyce </PERSON>, 62, is president and chief executive officer of <ORGANIZATION> Sematech </ORGANIZATION>, a consortium conducting fundamental research in electronics and computers. <PERSON> Kilby </PERSON>, 66, joined <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Instruments </ORGANIZATION> in 1958 where he conducted the research that led to his co-invention of the microchip. He is now an independent consultant in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> and chief technical officer for the <ORGANIZATION> Houston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Area </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, a technology development concern. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Stark </PERSON> <PERSON> Draper </PERSON>, for whom the engineering prize is named, was the inventor of inertial navigation, a guidance system that helped Apollo astronauts navigate to the moon.

<HEAD>FDA Says Generic Drug Review Results in One Recall</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> says its ongoing review of the 30 top-selling generic drugs has resulted so far in the recall of one drug. <ORGANIZATION> Pharmaceutical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Basics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION> recalled its antifungal nystatin tablets because they were found to be below potency, the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday. Five other companies have recalled drugs since the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> began investigating allegations of fraud and corruption within its generic drug division and among some generic drug makers. None of the recalled has posed a major safety problem, the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> said. The <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> said the Sept. 27 recall by Pharmaceutical Basics was `` the first recall'' stemming from the testing. It did not say whether further recalls would be required. The <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> said it has analyzed 1,827 samples of the 30 leading generics for potency, dissolution, composition and other specifications, and nearly all were found to be within acceptable specifications. About 1.6 percent of the samples were found to be deficient in potency or dissolution, which the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> said is about the rate it usually finds under normal industry conditions. The agency said it has more testing to do, and its findings are to be released at the end of the month.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> early Wednesday defeated a proposed cut in the capital-gains tax and on a tie vote approved a substitute saving-incentive plan that would allow all workers to have tax-deductible Individual Retirement Accounts. Nearing final action on a bill whose main purpose is to cut the federal deficit by about $ 8 billion in the fiscal year that began Sunday, the committee formally approved a 63 percent increase in the amount older Americans may earn without losing any of their Social Security benefits. The $ 1-billion-a-year change would benefit only the most affluent 10 percent of Social Security beneficiaries. On a 10-10 vote nearly along party lines, the committee retained a proposal in the bill by Chairman <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, to liberalize IRAs. The same vote rejected a cut in capital-gains tax offered by Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Packwood </PERSON>, R-Ore., along lines recommended by President <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> Only Sen. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Boren </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Okla </LOCATION>., broke party ranks, siding with the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> proposal <PERSON> Packwood </PERSON>'s amendment also included some <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> provisions, allowing workers to contribute to an account without any immediate tax deduction, but exempting interest from ever being taxed. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said that would simply shift the costs of IRAs to a future generation. He portrayed his own plan as superior to <PERSON> Packwood </PERSON>'s and to a different capital-gains reduction approved by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>. Republicans made clear they will renew the capital-gains fight on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor as early as this week. Most of the spending cuts in the bill would affect <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> reimbursements to hospitals and doctors. One provision would save money by overhauling the fee schedule for reimbursing doctors, basing fees on the time, training and skill required to provide a particular service. Also added to the bill, over objections of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration, was a provision removing the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> from the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> and creating it as an indepenent agency. A similar change is awaiting final action in the House. The change in the Social Security earnings limitation, which the panel had tentatively approved Monday, would benefit only the most affluent retirees between ages 65 and 69 _ those who earn more than $ 8,880 a year in retirement. That would be about one of every 10 Social Security beneficiaries in that age group. The committee agreed without discussion or dissent to boost the limit to $ 11,700 next year and then to $ 14,520. On the next $ 5,000 of earnings _ to a total of $ 19,520 _ the <ORGANIZATION> Social </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> recipient would give up $ 1 in benefits for each $ 4 earned. Once earnings pass $ 19,520, the penalty would be $ 1 for each $ 3 earned above the limit. Present law requires a retiree between the ages of 65 and 69 to give up $ 1 in Social Security pension for each $ 2 earned above the $ 8,880 earnings limit. The penalty is scheduled to drop next year to $ 1 for each $ 3 earned above the limit. A separate $ 6,480 limit affecting beneficiaries under age 65 would not be changed by the committee's proposal. Those 70 or older could continue to earn an unlimited amount without penalty. The House has agreed to a more modest increase in the 65-69 earnings limit, to $ 9,720 next year and $ 10,440 in 1991. The <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> voted to pay for the increase by requiring that deferred compensation, such as earnings set aside in a 401 -LRB- k -RRB- retirement plan, be included in the formula that determines `` average total wages'' for Social Security purposes. The short-run effect is to increase the amount of wages subject to Social Security taxes. In the long run, the change would cost the government more than it brings in, by forcing up Social Security benefits. The committee added to the bill a requirement that, starting in 1995, the government each year send a statement of Social Security benefits earned sto every person 60 and older. Starting in 1999, statements would have to be mailed to every worker.

<DATELINE>KIRKLAND, Wash. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 After pounding for three months on <ORGANIZATION> LIN </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s front door, <ORGANIZATION> McCaw </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cellular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> is trying a side entrance in its takeover attempt. <PERSON> McCaw </PERSON> said Tuesday it would acquire a half-interest in a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> cellular franchise whose other half is owned by <ORGANIZATION> LIN </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION>. At the same time, <ORGANIZATION> McCaw </ORGANIZATION> said it would sell its interests in 13 mobile-telephone franchises in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kentucky </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> to <ORGANIZATION> Contel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cellular </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> McCaw </PERSON>, the nation's largest cellular telephone company, said in a statement that the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> deal involves an agreement to pay $ 1.9 billion in cash for <ORGANIZATION> Metromedia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>'s one-half interest in <ORGANIZATION> Metro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> One </ORGANIZATION>, one of two <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> cellular franchises LIN, which owns the other half, would have a 45-day right of first refusal to the deal. The <ORGANIZATION> Metromedia </ORGANIZATION> deal would give <ORGANIZATION> McCaw </ORGANIZATION> a 50 percent voting interest and 45.67 percent equity interest in the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> franchise. LIN holds a 50 percent voting interest and 45 percent equity interest in the franchise, which would be controlled entirely by <ORGANIZATION> McCaw </ORGANIZATION> if its proposed acquisition of LIN goes through. `` It's a pretty savvy move by <PERSON> McCaw </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Reddan </PERSON>, a stock analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Moran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` McCaw is basically challenging LIN to either put up or shut up in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>.'' The most immediate question for LIN officials would be whether they wanted to borrow $ 1.9 billion to buy out <ORGANIZATION> Metro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> One </ORGANIZATION>. Taking on the additional debt could make LIN less attractive in its own efforts to merge with <ORGANIZATION> BellSouth </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in a 50-50 partnership, analysts said. In June, <PERSON> McCaw </PERSON> offered to buy LIN for $ 5.85 billion. LIN rejected that offer, but <PERSON> McCaw </PERSON> persisted, and dropped its offer from $ 127 per share to $ 110 per share after a court decision in July against <ORGANIZATION> LIN </ORGANIZATION>, which had claimed it owned key cellular franchise rights in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ciy </LOCATION>. The $ 110-a-share offer for approximately 53 million LIN shares has been extended to Oct. 13 despite <ORGANIZATION> LIN </ORGANIZATION>'s September announcement that it intended to merge with <ORGANIZATION> BellSouth </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> McCaw </PERSON>, LIN's largest shareholder with a 10 percent stake, has been tendered more than 8 million LIN shares, said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Campo </PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION> Adams </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Rinehart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> public relations agency representing McCaw. The <ORGANIZATION> Contel </ORGANIZATION> agreement would provide <ORGANIZATION> McCaw </ORGANIZATION> about $ 1.3 billion in cash, or about $ 205 a `` pop,'' an industry yardstick obtained by multiplying a market area population by the percentage ownership of cellular systems serving the market. Each market is allowed two cellular franchises, one for the local telephone company and one for an independent operation like <PERSON> McCaw </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> Contel </ORGANIZATION> agreement, which is subject to closing price adjustments, would make the <ORGANIZATION> Contel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> subsidiary the nation's seventh-largest cellular phone company, gaining controlling cellular interests in 13 Southeastern markets, including <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Memphis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Knoxville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Johnson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Chattanooga </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Clarksville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>; and <LOCATION> Birmingham </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tuscaloosa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florence </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Anniston </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gadsden </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Ala </PERSON> The <ORGANIZATION> Metromedia </ORGANIZATION> deal covers about 6.8 million pops, and works out to about $ 275 a pop. The <ORGANIZATION> Contel </ORGANIZATION> deal is about 6.1 million pops. Atlanta-based <ORGANIZATION> Contel </ORGANIZATION> currently has about 14.4 million pops. These are `` two more steps toward achieving our longstanding strategic objective of creating a national cellular network that will give <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> consumers an independent alternative to traditional providers of telephone service,'' <ORGANIZATION> McCaw </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> O. </PERSON> <PERSON> McCaw </PERSON> said. He described <ORGANIZATION> Contel </ORGANIZATION> as `` a fellow independent with whom we have had a long and mutually beneficial relationship.'' <PERSON> McCaw </PERSON>, based in this <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> suburb, operates in 127 areas with a total of 50 million pops in 26 states, including major regional systems along the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> and in the <LOCATION> Rocky </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Northeast </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 The union representing 57,000 <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> employees went on strike early Wednesday in its first strike against the world's largest aerospace company in 12 years. Machinist union members in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wichita </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION>, and elsewhere began the walkout at 12:01 a.m. local time, union officials said. In <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> on Tuesday, the union overwhelmingly rejected what <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> said would be its final contract offer. Union leaders had said they would notify a federal mediator, who joined negotiations last weekend, that they would be willing to consider resuming negotiations. But <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lodge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> 751 </ORGANIZATION>, said the union would not be in favor of extending the midnight strike deadline. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> issued a statement several hours after the strike vote, expressing disappointment but vowing to continue operations with supervisors and non-striking workers. `` Our airline customers have been notified of a strike and our intention to support deliveries to the best of our ability,'' <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> said. `` It is impossible to make a general statement on all defense and space programs since they are at various stages of development and production.'' Union leaders said the members were unified and determined to get a better share of <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>'s recent success. `` I'm pleased that the rank and file are as solid as they are and as united as they are on the issues,'' said <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, adding the union would take a dim view of extending the strike deadline. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said the main reason for the strike vote was a feeling that <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> workers deserved a greater share of the company's record prosperity `` We have gone through the hard times with this company. We just want to go through the good times with them as well as the hard times,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> left a brief news conference with reporters to go to union headquarters where he said he would attend a briefing for picket captains. The rejected offer for the machinists promised an immediate raise of 4 percent with 3 percent raises in both 1990 and 1991. The proposed three-year contract also contained annual bonuses of 8 percent of a worker's gross earnings this year and 3 percent the next, insurance improvements and reduced compulsory overtime requirements. Workers filling more than half of the 65,000-seat Kingdome jeered the proposed contract and folded summaries of it into paper airplanes which filled the air of the indoor stadium throughout a loud meeting.

 `` We would certainly have to have more,'' <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> told reporters earlier as the machinists filed toward the podium to vote. `` We have told the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> what it would take to settle the contract.'' <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>'s stock rose $ 3.12 -LCB- to $ 59.75 a share in <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> trading Tuesday, apparently on expectations that the contract would be ratified. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> machinists voting in <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Wichita </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, and elsewhere were asked to decide whether to accept the contract, which required a simple majority, and whether to strike, which required approval by two-thirds of those voting. The union previously authorized a strike at midnight Tuesday, the same time its three-year contract with <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> expires. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said he expected the eventual settlement to set a pattern for labor talks throughout the aerospace industry. <PERSON> Judith </PERSON> <PERSON> Comeau </PERSON>, an aerospace industry analyst for <ORGANIZATION> Goldman </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sachs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said a strike would not be `` a big issue, provided it does n't go much longer than two weeks. `` Financially the company is very strong with $ 3.2 billion in cash, $ 5 billion in equity and $ 200 million in debts. The impact of a strike probably wo n't even be measurable,'' <PERSON> Comeau </PERSON> said. `` It wo n't make customers happy because there's already been some delays in deliveries, especially 747s. Quite simply, they're just going to have to wait,'' she said Union leaders told the machinists, who last struck <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> in 1977 for two months, the time was right to demand more. `` If you are n't tough enough to secure a decent contract this time you'll never get one,'' said <PERSON> Justin </PERSON> <PERSON> Ostro </PERSON>, general union vice president and bargaining coordinator. `` If you turn tail and run, do n't come back in three years'' expecting great change, he added. `` There is no good time to strike. There is only the right time.'' <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>, the world's largest commercial airplane builder, is enjoying its fifth consecutive year of record jetliner orders, with carriers and leasing companies ordering 736 planes worth $ 38.5 billion so far this year. Though Pentagon cutbacks have reduced military business, <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commercial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airplanes </ORGANIZATION> has a backlog of nearly 1,600 jets worth about $ 70 billion and deliveries extending well into the mid-1990s. For 1988, profits were $ 614 million on $ 16.96 billion in sales. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said a strike could last `` a week. It could be months.'' He said there was some division among <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> workers about the bonuses, with veteran employees content to see all compensation in their paychecks and newer workers preferring the extra check at the end of the year. The proposed contract also includes a cost-of-living adjustment that is 99 percent of actual inflation, which is 17 cents per hour better than the present formula. Worldwide, <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> employs 144,725 people, including 106,000 in western <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 The Fair Trade Commission has raided <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION>'s major authorized dealers to investigate allegations that they pressured magazines to drop advertisements for discount stores selling Apple products, officials said Wednesday. On Tuesday, the <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> raided almost 40 sites, including seven offices of <ORGANIZATION> Canon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sales </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION>, Japanese headquarters of the California-based <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Mitsuru </PERSON> <PERSON> Suzuki </PERSON>, an <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> investigator <ORGANIZATION> Canon </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> denied the allegations. An official at the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION>, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> could warn, but not punish, any companies found to have applied such pressure. <PERSON> Suzuki </PERSON> said one non-authorized retailer of Apple products had filed a complaint accusing <ORGANIZATION> Canon </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> of pressuring some major computer magazines not to publish such retailers' ads featuring discounted <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION> computers. `` It's sabotage to free business activities,'' <PERSON> Suzuki </PERSON> said, `` and we suspect Apple might have been cooperating in the action, which prevents equal opportunity for other competitors.'' Among the popular Apple products involved are desk-top computers such as Macintosh Plus and Macintosh SE, printers including Image Writer II, hard discs and external drives for added memory capacity. <PERSON> Akisuke </PERSON> <PERSON> Fukutomi </PERSON>, an executive of Step, one of about 10 individual importers of Macintosh computers, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> that he filed the complaint with the <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION>. `` Our company is the victim,'' he said. He said `` Mac Life,'' a major computer magazine published by <PERSON> Kawade </PERSON> <PERSON> Shobo </PERSON> and featuring <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION> products, carried one advertisement by Step in April but then stopped. The magazine's editor apologized, explaining that <ORGANIZATION> Canon </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION> pressured the magazine, he said. The editor could not be reached for comment. `` We should be given equal opportunity so that everybody can compete on the same ground,'' <PERSON> Fukutomi </PERSON> said. `` We have no fancy showrooms, nor do we have beautiful brochures. But our low pricing is reasonable, and what's wrong with that?'' he said. For example, a 4-mega-bite Macintosh SE with Japanese language capability costs $ 6,030 through any of the 20 authorized agents, whereas Step sells it for $ 4,200, he said. Since June, another major monthly magazine, <ORGANIZATION> ASCII </ORGANIZATION>, has left blank spaces in Step's ads where there used to be prices. Step also carries <ORGANIZATION> NEC </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Epson </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Toshiba </ORGANIZATION> computers, <PERSON> Fukutomi </PERSON> said, adding that it sells some 110 Macs a month. <ORGANIZATION> Canon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sales </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> was the sole agent for <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION> computers in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> until <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION>'s subsidiary was establisheed in 1983. <ORGANIZATION> Canon </ORGANIZATION> does not import Apple computers, but distributes 80 percent to 90 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computers </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> to about 240 retail stores, said <PERSON> Motoyuki </PERSON> <PERSON> Fujimoto </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Canon </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. `` We are innocent, and there is no evidence to merit such suspicion,'' he said. <PERSON> Takashi </PERSON> <PERSON> Fujimura </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Canon </ORGANIZATION>'s managing director, said in a statement, `` We're in a position to help the <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> investigate, as well as conducting our own investigation internally.'' The <ORGANIZATION> FTC </ORGANIZATION> also accused <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> of refusing to repair Apple products brought in by customers who had bought them from non-authorized retailers. <ORGANIZATION> Apple </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Computer </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Keiko </PERSON> <PERSON> Fukushima </PERSON> said the company had no intention to prevent fair competition. `` The reason we can not fix the machines is that many of the computers purchased through non-authorized dealers do not have serial numbers, which is the most important identification of Apple products for repair,'' she said. While some individual importers have been reported erasing serial numbers to avoid tracing and interference with their supply sources, <PERSON> Step </PERSON>'s <PERSON> Fukutomi </PERSON> said his stores has been using the serial numbers since Sept. 1, ending the repair problem.

<HEAD>Harley Vows to Stay Independent Despite Possible Takeover Bid</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MILWAUKEE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Harley-Davidson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, the only remaining <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> motorcycle manufacturer, says it plans to stay independent despite a possible takeover bid from an investor group holding a 6.24 percent stake in the company. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Teerlink </PERSON>, <PERSON> Harley </PERSON>'s chief executive officer, said the group headed by businessman <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Glazer </PERSON> has had no contact with the company. `` I do n't know him or his intent,'' <PERSON> Teerlink </PERSON> said of <PERSON> Glazer </PERSON> in a statement. However, <PERSON> Teerlink </PERSON> said <PERSON> Harley </PERSON> management, which repurchased the company from <ORGANIZATION> AMF </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in 1981 and later took it public, wanted to remain independent. <PERSON> Harley </PERSON> is the last remaining <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> manufacturer of motorcycles. In a filing Monday with the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Glazer </PERSON> said he had purchased 488,200 shares, or 5.7 percent of <PERSON> Harley </PERSON>'s common stock. The filing said <PERSON> Glazer </PERSON>'s six children each controlled 8,500 shares of <PERSON> Harley </PERSON> for a family total of 6.24 percent. <PERSON> Glazer </PERSON>, of <LOCATION> Rochester </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, is chairman of <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Allied </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which he said has interests in more than 30 companies in 12 states with assets of more than $ 200 million. `` We invest in companies which we feel are significantly undervalued, are leaders in their field, have strong brand name recognition and exhibit tremendous future growth potential,'' <PERSON> Glazer </PERSON> said, adding that <PERSON> Harley </PERSON> had those qualifications. <PERSON> Teerlink </PERSON> confirmed that management controls a 10 percent stake in the company, and he said <PERSON> Harley </PERSON>'s anti-takeover measures include a `` poison pill'' shareholder rights plan. When asked if the company would do anything differently to increase the value of its stock, he replied, `` We think the way we run the business enhances shareholder value well with a longterm view.'' <PERSON> Teerlink </PERSON> said he spoke Tuesday to <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Harley </PERSON>'s largest stockholder with a 12.9 percent interest, but he declined to comment on what was discussed. <PERSON> Harley </PERSON> stock rose $ 3.62 -LCB- to $ 42.75 in <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> composite trading Tuesday. <PERSON> Harley </PERSON> is best known for its heavyweight motorcycles built for highway travel and favored by many law enforcement agencies.

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Stock prices slipped at midday Wednesday as an initial surge was turned back by nervousness over the pound. At 12:15 p.m. local time, the <ORGANIZATION> Financial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times-Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> 100-share index was down 3.8 points at 2,314.9, off its early surge of 2,331.1. Midday volume totaled 316.5 million shares, compared with 338.1 million the same time Tuesday. Dealers said shares were buoyed early by Wall Street's strength on Tuesday, but jitters over the outlook for sterling got the upper hand. Sterling fell against the West German mark, raising concerns that the government would push up interest rates to support the pound. The market is awaiting the outcome of Thursday's meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Deutsche </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bundesbank </ORGANIZATION> central bank council. Many traders are expecting a half-point hike in key West German interest rates to come out of the meeting, although some analysts said such a move already was fully discounted by the market.

<HEAD>Unisys Begins Restructuring</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BLUE BELL, Pa. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said it hopes to see savings in the fourth quarter from a restructuring plan that will reduce the work force by 8,000 and annual costs by more than $ 400 million. The cost-cutting moves, originally announced Aug. 18 and begun this week, are designed to counter weak domestic demand for computers and defense electronics products and stiffer worldwide competition. <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> said Tuesday it plans to cut roughly 1,000 more jobs than originally expected when it first announced the restructuring. The austerity measures involve laying off 6,300 people and eliminating 1,700 positions through attrition and early retirement. That will reduce the work force by nearly 10 percent to about 80,000 worldwide, the company said. <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Blumenthal </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> chairman and chief executive officer, said the restructuring plan was the result of months of planning. `` The actions being announced today will reduce our costs in 1990 significantly, and along with other planned improvements, this will lead to a substantial lowering of our break-even point,'' he said Tuesday. `` By simplifying our organizational structure and shortening lines of communication, we will be better able to meet our customer's needs.'' <PERSON> Blumenthal </PERSON> said the cost of restructuring would be announced later this month with the third-quarter financial results. The company said it expects to take a substantial charge in the third quarter. <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> has been losing ground in the mainframe and minicomputer markets lately. In addition, its big defense business has lagged partly due to slowing growth in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> defense budget and also because of a three-month suspension in its dealings with the government tied to the company's involvement in the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> procurement scandal. <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> is cutting jobs throughout the company, including on the corporate level, according to <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Hynes </PERSON>. This week, the company plans to eliminate 3,200 jobs at 250 sites in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. An additional 1,200 jobs outside the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will be cut by the first quarter of 1990. <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION>, the nation's No. 3 computer company, will continue cutting 1,900 jobs later this year and into 1990. In addition to layoffs, the plan involves eliminating overhead and consolidating administrative and technical support functions, reducing manufacturing overseas and increasing the move toward in-house production of the company's major microprocessor lines. The company said it expects the program to lower the company's break-even point by more than $ 1.5 billion, meaning that if it were to break even on roughly $ 10 billion of sales it expects to post for this year, it would be able to break even on $ 8.5 billion of sales in 1990 Last quarter, the company reported a 67 percent decrease in earnings, blaming a drop in inventory, pricing pressure from competitors and a temporary suspension of <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> work. <PERSON> Hynes </PERSON> said the company's consolidation plans include transferring the manufacture of computer mainframes from <LOCATION> Tredyffrin </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Clear </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, by mid-1990. <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> will close its St. Laurent, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, plant in 1990 and shift its engineering support to <PERSON> Rancho </PERSON> <PERSON> Bernardo </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>. Most of the manufacturing at the <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peripherals </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clara </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, hardest hit with 350 job cuts, will be consolidated into other facilities. In addition, <PERSON> Hynes </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Unisys </ORGANIZATION> is implementing a new plan to strengthen its approach to selected markets and to reallocate support services. The original plan was adopted in 1986 when <ORGANIZATION> Sperry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Burroughs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> merged.

<HEAD>Executive Predicts Braniff Will Survive as Smaller Airline</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ORLANDO, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Deregulation has hurt smaller, independent airlines while favoring larger carriers, a top executive of <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> told aviation executives as his cash-starved airline tries to rebuild as a smaller carrier. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Volz </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION>'s senior vice president for marketing, blamed the carrier's troubles on the government's 1978 deregulation of the nation's airline industry. <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION>, based in <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION>, filed last week for Chapter 11 bankruptcy reorganization and protection from creditors _ its second such filing in seven years. Frequent-flier tickets are a particular source of unfair competition, <PERSON> Volz </PERSON> told about 300 aviation executives attending the <ORGANIZATION> Transport </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aircraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marketing </ORGANIZATION> Symposium in <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION> Tuesday. Although he said he does n't favor a return to tight regulation of the industry, <PERSON> Volz </PERSON> suggested that the government should consider ordering an end to frequent-flier programs, which he said allow unfair competition. Because of its smaller size, <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION>'s frequent-flier program was not started until after those of the larger airlines, <PERSON> Volz </PERSON> said, and was n't able to catch up. <PERSON> Volz </PERSON> said small airlines such as <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> also were damaged by travel agents he described as being `` locked in'' by the suppliers of their computerized reservation systems. Those systems, he noted, either are owned outright _ or jointly _ by the big airlines. Between 1978 and 1988, he said, the number of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airlines dropped from 36 to 28, while the carriers' combined profit fell to $ 600 million from $ 1 billion, and 200 airlines filed for bankruptcy or halted operations. Although <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> has run out of cash, it hopes to remain aloft as a smaller airline with hubs in <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, and reduced service to `` spoke'' cities, <PERSON> Volz </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> will remain the airline's primary hub because of its central location, <PERSON> Volz </PERSON> said, and <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION> will continue as a hub because it is one of the fastest-growing areas in the nation. Passengers from feeder, or spoke, cities will be flown to the hubs to catch connecting flights. A new <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> marketing program will start within two weeks, emphasizing `` a smaller, independent airline with a lower price range,'' <PERSON> Volz </PERSON> said. `` We'll have to be a boutique airline, offering more for less.'' <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> resumed service this past weekend after halting nearly all flights last Wednesday, the day before its bankruptcy filing. The airline announced Tuesday that it operated all 46 scheduled departures in 11 cities nationwide. <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> also said it will continue to offer $ 99 one-way bargain fares to all destinations through Oct. 31. The airline was `` booking up heavily under this deep discount offer,'' <PERSON> Volz </PERSON> said. About 2,000 employees out of <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION>'s pre-strike workforce of 4,800 were on duty Tuesday. The company's <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION> workforce dropped from 1,000 to 275. In 1982, <ORGANIZATION> Braniff </ORGANIZATION> filed for bankruptcy reorganization in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, where it was based at the time. The airline emerged from Chapter 11 protection in 1986.

 The stock market was little changed today, running into some resistance after Tuesday's upsurge to record highs. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up 40.84 points on Tuesday, rose another 2.47 to 2,757.03 by noontime on Wall Street. Gainers and losers ran about even in nationwide trading of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 660 up, 658 down and 519 unchanged. Analysts noted some `` catch-up'' buying by investors who were caught off guard by the market's revived rally this week. The new advance in stock prices was attributed in large measure to persistent strength in the dollar and declining interest rates. Talk began stirring in the financial world early this week that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> might soon find room to relax its credit policy further, prompted by slow-to-moderate economic growth and favorable inflation news. However, interest rates levelled off in the credit markets today, and brokers said a few traders were selling to cash in the recent gains in stock prices. Among actively traded blue chips, <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION> rose 2 to 38 \ and <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> added -RRB- to 58 ~, but McDonald's dropped -LCB- to 30 and <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telephone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Telegraph was down -RRB- at <ORGANIZATION> Microsoft </ORGANIZATION> climbed 4 \ to 73 \ in the over-the-counter The company said it expects to report a 34 percent revenue increase for its fiscal first quarter, ended Sept. 30.

 More than 57,000 Machinists in at least seven states struck <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> today, demanding a bigger share of its record prosperity and threatening production delays at the world's biggest aerospace company The union members, including 43,300 in the <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> area, took to the picket lines after midnight. At <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airplanes </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Wichita </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION>, the second-largest concentration of union members, pickets let non-strikers' cars through one at a time after sometimes heated exchanges. Traffic was backed up about a mile. The wife of a picket who jumped onto a car entering the plant fell and suffered bruises, a sheriff's spokeswoman said. In <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION>, pickets shivered in 45-degree weather outside <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> headquarters. `` People are willing to picket, willing to do whatever it takes,'' said picket <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> McTighe </PERSON>. `` The attitude seems to be militant.'' No new talks have been announced. The strike hits a company struggling to meet delivery schedules in the midst of its fifth consecutive year of record jetliner orders. `` We have gone through the hard times with this company,'' said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lodge </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> 751 </ORGANIZATION>. `` We just want to go through the good times with them as well as the hard times.'' The Machinists voted overwhelmingly Tuesday to reject a three-year contract offer. The union represents the bulk of the company's production workers, who perform tasks ranging from riveting, wiring and plumbing in aircraft to quality inspections and machine-tool maintenance. The Machinists last struck <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> in 1977, for two months. Airlines and leasing companies striving to replace their aging fleets and meet a surge in passenger traffic have ordered 736 planes worth $ 38.5 billion so far this year. Though Pentagon cutbacks have reduced military business, <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>'s commercial division has a backlog of nearly 1,600 jets worth about $ 70 billion, with deliveries extending into the mid-1990s. The backlog has caused embarrassing delays in deliveries of the new 747-400 jumbo jet, <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>'s first in two decades, and forced workers to put in heavy overtime. `` We're working on airplanes,'' said <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Branson </PERSON>, a worker outside the Everett plant. `` We should n't be working fatigued. They push for quantity, not quality.'' <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> promised to meet delivery schedules `` to the best of our ability.'' Spokesman <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Binder </PERSON> said the company was trying to find supervisors to work assembly lines and keep jets rolling out. He said there were no plans to bring in outsiders. `` This is a negotiating position,'' <PERSON> Binder </PERSON> said of the company's latest offer `` It's not a take-it-or-leave-it.'' He refused to comment further on the company's reaction to the walkout. Union spokesman <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Daniels </PERSON> said it would take two to three weeks to shut down operations completely because supervisors could finish some nearly completed planes with parts on hand. A shutdown could worsen the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade deficit. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> is the country's largest exporter. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said union members were determined to get a better share of <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>'s record prosperity. The company earned $ 614 million last year on sales of $ 16.96 billion. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> also holds $ 3.66 billion in cash and short-term notes. The company's three-year offer included an immediate 4 percent raise with 3 percent raises in 1990 and 1991, plus annual bonuses of 8 percent of a worker's gross earnings this year and 3 percent the next. Workers have n't had an increase in base wages _ which determine pensions and other benefits _ for six years, although <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> paid bonuses of 12 percent in 1986 and 5 percent in 1987 and 1988. The proposal also would have reduced compulsory overtime from 200 hours a quarter to 160 hours and boosted some benefits and the cost-of-living adjustment. For the average Machinist making $ 13.39 per hour, the offer would have given an additional $ 13,800 in income over the next three years. Workers filling more than half of the 65,000-seat Kingdome jeered the offer Tuesday and folded summaries of it into paper airplanes that sailed down from the second and third tiers of the indoor stadium. `` If you are n't tough enough to secure a decent contract this time you'll never get one,'' <PERSON> Justin </PERSON> <PERSON> Ostro </PERSON>, general union vice president and bargaining coordinator, told the crowd. Worldwide, <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> employs 144,725 people, including 106,000 in western <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. In addition to the <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> workers, the Machinists represent 12,000 employees in <LOCATION> Wichita </LOCATION>, about 1,700 workers in <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION>, and a few hundred others in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Hawaii </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> and some other states. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> said $ 100 million is available in a strike fund from the parent union, which has been on strike against <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> since March. Strike pay is a flat $ 100 a week per union member, he added.

 In politics, one of the safest, popular, commendable and perhaps rewarding stances is to be for the poor, especially through government transfer programs. tific director since 1985. `` Many of the things that we used to blame on age ... are indeed modifiable -LRB- by lifestyle -RRB- and probably add to the life expectancy and add to the quality of life of people.'' The BLSA, a component of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> on Aging in the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION>, was founded in 1958 by Dr. <PERSON> Nathan </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shock </PERSON>, regarded as the founder of modern research on aging. He started the first NIH section on gerontology in 1941 at <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION>. `` Dr. Shock wanted to measure such things as the rate of aging,'' said <PERSON> Fozard </PERSON>. `` As it turns out, this hope sort of disintegrated and was replaced by a number of more specific questions.'' BLSA researchers have studied aging's effects on more than 1,800 people, who are given physical examinations. Tests are done each visit on all of the organ systems, the condition of the blood, muscles, bones, hearing and vision. Electrocardiograms and tests using radiation are given less frequently. Volunteers also are tested on their memory, reasoning and problem-solving abilities, intelligence and personality, a history of each person's aging that is used in more than 50 studies under way as part of the overall project. Among the findings is that `` there is no single biological master clock which drives all of the physiological aging that we see,'' <PERSON> Fozard </PERSON> said. Volunteers pay their own way to <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> and spend more than two days every 2 -LCB- years undergoing as many as 103 medical and behavioral tests. `` I know of no other study that makes that kind of demand,'' he said. `` We ask them for a lifetime'' of commitment, and many agree to be autopsied after they die. The study pays for lodging and meals while volunteers are here, as well as for the tests, which could total $ 4,000 at a doctor's office or hospital The volunteers range in age from 20 to 97. Sixty-five percent are men, 70 percent are college educated, and half of those have advanced degrees. Most are middle - or upper-middle-class and only 5 percent are black `` In some of the studies the social class definitely makes a difference,'' <PERSON> Fozard </PERSON> said. `` In that sense, the study may not be as representative'' as one with a more varied sample. But `` when you compare all types of biological results, these things do n't vary much on social class.'' Scientists who use data from the <ORGANIZATION> BLSA </ORGANIZATION> say the racial and social structure of the study is one of its weaknesses. `` In an ideal world, we'd have it truly representative of all groups in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>,'' said Dr. <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> at the <ORGANIZATION> Wilmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eye </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> at <ORGANIZATION> Johns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hopkins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION>. `` But you have to be realistic. There is a variety of people there and everybody is going to die. Everybody gets old.'' Researchers say the study's history explains its sociological profile. The first subject, Dr. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Wesley </PERSON> <PERSON> Peter </PERSON>, recruited participants from among family and friends, a practice that continues among volunteers today. The study has a waiting list of about 1,000 people, and researchers have not made an effort to broaden its base, <PERSON> Fozard </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kirby </PERSON>'s grandfather volunteered shortly after the study began. Since then, <PERSON> Kirby </PERSON>, 40, of <LOCATION> Glenwood </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, his father, brother and three sisters became involved. His wife, <PERSON> Pamela </PERSON>, and a sister's husband also have volunteered The involvement of nine members of a single family could help the <ORGANIZATION> BLSA </ORGANIZATION> determine whether heredity determines aging, <PERSON> Kirby </PERSON> said. `` If they can see a trend in different generations of a family, they might find a genetic link.'' That genetic link still has scientists baffled, <PERSON> Fozard </PERSON> said. `` We are constantly looking for ways to measure to get a handle on the genetic component of aging. We think there are only a few genes involved with aging, but where they are and what they are is still a mystery.'' <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Nicholson </PERSON>, 86, of <LOCATION> Mesa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ariz. </LOCATION>, joined the study in 1960. He recently completed his 13th checkup for the study, which he said has `` made me more cognizant of aging and the aging population.'' <PERSON> Nicholson </PERSON> said he also has modified his diet and made other changes in his lifestyle as a result of information gleaned during his visit. Information on any medical problem detected is given to the volunteers, and their family physicians are notified so treatment can be prescribed. `` The longer I have cooperated, the more they are providing information to us,'' <PERSON> Nicholson </PERSON> said. `` They give me good advice and that is very helpful.'' Fifteen scientists work with the <ORGANIZATION> BLSA </ORGANIZATION> full-time, <PERSON> Fozard </PERSON> said. As many as 10 other scientists collaborate periodically through agreements with universities around the country. The study has an annual budget of about $ 3 million. Volunteers say the <ORGANIZATION> BLSA </ORGANIZATION>'s impact on society is enormous. `` The longer it can run, the more value they will get out of it,'' said <PERSON> Nicholson </PERSON>. `` I would certainly hate to see it stopped.''

 The $ 50 billion <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> earmarked two months ago to rescue failed savings institutions may not be enough, <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Chairman <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON> said today `` It is possible that $ 50 billion will prove to be an insufficient amount to deal with potential failures,'' <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON> said in written testimony presented to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. `` But it is really much too early to make a reliable new prediction of loss,'' he added at the first hearing on the savings and loan bailout since <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> passed the legislation Aug. 9. Also testifying were Treasury Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> and Housing Secretary <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, who are members of the oversight board setting policy for the <ORGANIZATION> Resolution </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, created to close and sell failed thrifts. <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON>, whose agency operates the <ORGANIZATION> RTC </ORGANIZATION>, said the government has taken control of 283 failed S & amp; Ls with $ 112 billion in assets. Of the 283, it has closed 24 small institutions and expects to sell five large institutions by next week. Through August 1992, thrift regulators may turn over another 300 S & amp; Ls to the <ORGANIZATION> RTC </ORGANIZATION>, bringing the total failures to nearly 600 with combined assets exceeding $ 300 billion, he said. Those projections `` raise questions about the adequacy of the $ 50 billion in <ORGANIZATION> RTC </ORGANIZATION> funding,'' <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON> said. His written comments throw the strongest doubt yet on whether one installment on the S & amp; L bailout will be enough. However, in his oral presentation to the committee, <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON> changed his tone slightly, saying, `` At this point we have no basis with which to make a different estimate from the -LRB- $ 50 billion -RRB- one you've heard.'' Private analysts have been saying for months that $ 50 billion would amount only to a substantial down payment on resolving the S & amp; L mess. Both <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> and <PERSON> Greenspan </PERSON> told the committee it is too soon to know if the $ 50 billion is enough. `` I think -LRB- it -RRB- is n't the point. Maybe we need 52, maybe we need 48. THe point is we've taken a bonfire and tamped it down to the point where it's embers,'' <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> said. Meanwhile, both <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON> and <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, who heads a cabinet-level oversight board setting policy for the <ORGANIZATION> RTC </ORGANIZATION>, reassured lawmakers they are working to prevent any scandal in the S & amp; L bailout. `` Let us assure you that the oversight board is as anxious as this committee to protect against conflicts of interest, political favoritism and other improper actions by employees, agents, independent contractors and all others who perform services for both the oversight board and the <ORGANIZATION> RTC </ORGANIZATION>,'' <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> said. Members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> alarmed by the scandal at the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> are trying to prevent similar abuses from developing at the <ORGANIZATION> RTC </ORGANIZATION>. `` The potential problems at the <ORGANIZATION> RTC </ORGANIZATION> dwarf the substantial problems the -LRB- Housing -RRB- secretary has thus far encountered at <ORGANIZATION> HUD </ORGANIZATION>,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, D-Mich., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> The <ORGANIZATION> RTC </ORGANIZATION> last week issued an interim ethics code governing the thousands of independent contractors it is expected to hire to manage the real estate and other assets it is inheriting from the thrifts. So far, the <ORGANIZATION> RTC </ORGANIZATION> has spent $ 20 billion: $ 1.8 billion to close the 24 small <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls, $ 8.3 billion to handle five large institutions by next week and five smaller not-yet-completed deals, $ 8.5 billion to replace high-cost deposits and $ 1.4 billion as a reserve fund to handle liquidity problems at thrifts that have failed but are still open, <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON> said. Deputy Treasury Secretary <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robson </PERSON> said inability to close the five big cases by Sept. 30, the last day of fiscal 1989, means the reported federal budget deficit will be $ 8 billion higher in fiscal 1990. However, he said that would not trigger automatic spending cuts under the Gramm-Rudman law. The 1990 budget estimate taken for determining those cuts was made on Aug. 15, he said. Members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> also are looking at the division of the <ORGANIZATION> RTC </ORGANIZATION>'s management, in which <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>'s board sets its policy and <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON>'s agency does the work. `` No joint enterprise of any magnitude is without its healthy frictions, and ours is no exception,'' <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> said. `` But overall we have gotten off to an excellent start.'' Meanwhile, the oversight board announced Tuesday that it has appointed <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kearney </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> pension fund adviser and mortgage-backed securities expert, as its chief staff officer with the title of president. <PERSON> Kearney </PERSON> replaces <PERSON> Robson </PERSON>, who was filling the oversight board post on an interim basis.

<HEAD>Farmers Like `Shoebox' Bookkeeping: Survey</HEAD>

 Farmers may be innovative in their crop and livestock management, but many cling to the old shoebox method when it comes to bookkeeping, an annual survey by the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> has found. Fewer than 3 percent of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> farmers use computers to keep financial records, while 56 percent use general ledgers or notebooks. About 16 percent use some kind of financial records workbook. <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> Willimack </PERSON> of the department's <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said that leaves 25 percent who use `` other methods'' of keeping records, including 14 percent who use the proverbial shoebox or similar way of hanging onto receipts, invoices and bills of sale. Although <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>, county agents and private farm management experts have preached for years about `` the business of farming'' and how accurate records should be kept, relatively few of the nation's 2.2 million farms have entered the computer age. Statistician Willimack based her study on her agency's annual Farm Costs and Returns Survey for calendar year 1987. `` Previously, there had been little documentation of farmers' actual recordkeeping practices, although much has been written about how farmers should keep financial records for tax or management purposes,'' she said <PERSON> Willimack </PERSON>'s study was reported in the current issue of <LOCATION> Farmline </LOCATION> magazine. Some other findings: _ Fewer than 12 percent of farmers subscribe to financial recordkeeping services. Most of those used are provided by accountants. _ Computer usage is not uniform among farmers. Nearly 15 percent of large farms, those with annual sales of at least $ 250,000, used computers, and nearly 40 percent of those used recordkeeping services. _ Use of farm record workbooks was most popular in the <LOCATION> Midwest </LOCATION>, with 20 percent to 30 percent of the farmers in the <LOCATION> Corn </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Belt </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Northern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Lake </PERSON> regions using them. The Extension Service accounted for about 25 percent of the workbooks, and the <ORGANIZATION> Farmers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> 11 percent. _ Computer use was greatest in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> region, where they were used on 4.6 percent of the farms. `` This was probably due to the prominence of corporate farms, and the larger size and greater complexity of farms in this area,'' <PERSON> Willimack </PERSON> said. _ One-third of all corporations used a recordkeeping service, possibly their own paid bookkeepers. <PERSON> Willimack </PERSON> said the consistency of general ledger use by 50 percent to 60 percent of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> farm operators seemed to suggest that records are kept primarily for tax purposes, rather than as aids for making managerial decisions. `` Participants in government programs apparently keep more complete financial records than non-participants,'' she said. Also, <PERSON> Willimack </PERSON> noted the use of more advanced recordkeeping by younger, better educated farm and ranch operators indicates they adopt such practices as they gain the ability or perceive the need to use them. `` It appears that farm operators are moving up the learning curve with regard to recordkeeping practices, but there is still ample room for improvement,'' she said.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> says the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has bought 2 million metric tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corn, the first for delivery in 1989-90 under a long-term supply agreement. Rumors had been circulating in the grain trade that the Soviets were in the market for a large order of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corn. The seventh year of the long-term agreement between the two countries began Oct. 1. Officials said <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> grain sales to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in 1988-89, the sixth year of the agreement were a record of more than 21.7 million tons, including more than 16.3 million tons of corn and nearly 5.4 million tons of wheat. In addition, 1988-89 sales included 442,500 tons of soybeans, 1.35 million tons of soybean meal and 1.02 million tons of grain sorghums. A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 39.4 bushels of corn or 36.7 bushels of wheat or soybeans. The 2 million tons of corn would be about 78.8 million bushels. The sales were made by unidentified private exporting companies, which are required by law to report large sales to the department. No selling prices or further details were released. <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Homann </PERSON> of the department's <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said it was the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s largest single order of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corn in at least three years, although there were several orders of more than 1 million each last year. Corn prices have been averaging about $ 2.22 per bushel at the farm level, according to <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s five-day average, meaning that the latest sale could have a farm value of about $ 175 million. The agreement was extended last year until Dec. 31, 1990. Meanwhile, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> are preparing to begin preliminary talks in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> on Dec. 4 for a new long-term agreement. Under the current agreement, the Soviets are committed to buy at least 9 million tons of grain annually, including a minimum of 4 million tons each of wheat and corn, and 1 million tons that can be wheat, corn, soybeans and soybean meal, or any combination of those commodities. The pact also allows <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> to buy up to 3 million tons of additional wheat and corn annually without further discussions. If more than 12 million tons are wanted, however, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> must be consulted.

Cadence had earlier this year entered a cooperative marketing agreement with Gateway and had offered Gateway's simulation software as part of its overall line of products for electronic design. Cadence said Gateway will operate as a division under <PERSON> Prabhu </PERSON> <PERSON> Goel </PERSON>, Gateway's founder, president and chief executive. <PERSON> Goel </PERSON> will also serve on the board. Cadence said it will issue 4 million shares of stock to buy Gateway. The merger will increase <PERSON> Cadene </PERSON>'s workforce from 750 to about 900 people. Cadence said it hopes to complete the consolidation by year's end. The merger must still be approved by regulatory agencies and Gateway stockholders.

<UNK>World Coffee Price Hits 14-Year Low</UNK>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Coffee prices plunged to 14-year lows on Wednesday after an official expressed pessimism about efforts to restore export quotas. On the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> market, coffee for January delivery fell by $ 81.60 from Tuesday's close to $ 1,062.40 a metric ton, recovering later to finish the day at $ 1,088. The <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coffee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>'s latest indicator of the average price of coffee traded throughout the world, released Wednesday, was 64.31 cents a pound, a level last seen in 1975. After accounting for inflation, the price of coffee in real terms is now at its most depressed level since the 1920s, analysts said. The latest price fall started Tuesday when <PERSON> Jorio </PERSON> <PERSON> Duaster </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s chief coffee executive, said there was no chance of an early return of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coffee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>'s export quota system to keep excess world production off the market. His remarks while attending a <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> meeting of the organization on the problem appeared to dash hopes of early international action to lift and stabilize the market.

 The stock market gained more ground today, following through on Tuesday's upsurge to record highs. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials, up 40.84 points on Tuesday, rose another 18.24 to 2,772.80 by 2 p.m. on Wall Street. Gainers outnumbered losers by about 5 to 4 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed issues, with 820 up, 624 down and 507 unchanged. Analysts noted some `` catch-up'' buying by investors who were caught off guard by the market's revived rally this week. The new advance in stock prices was attributed in large measure to persistent strength in the dollar and declining interest rates. Talk began stirring in the financial world early this week that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> might soon find room to relax its credit policy further, prompted by slow-to-moderate economic growth and favorable inflation news. Interest rates levelled off in the credit markets today. But after hesitating for the first two hours of the session, stocks began forging ahead again. Among the blue chips, <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION> rose 2 \ to 38 -LCB-; <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> 1 -LCB- to 107 -LCB-; <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Roebuck </ORGANIZATION> | to 44 -LRB-, and <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> -LCB- to 59 <ORGANIZATION> Microsoft </ORGANIZATION> climbed 5 -LCB- to 74 -LCB- in the over-the-counter market. The company said it expects to report a 34 percent revenue increase for its fiscal first quarter, ended Sept. 30. The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>'s composite index of all its listed common stocks gained 1.22 to 198.06. At the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the market value index was up 1.35 at 394.37.

<HEAD>Debate Rages Over Reforming Civil End of Racketeering Law</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By STEFAN FATSIS</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> `` Fat Tony'' <PERSON> Salerno </PERSON> and <PERSON> Leona </PERSON> <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> have more in common than a criminal record. <PERSON> Salerno </PERSON> was convicted under the criminal side of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act of running a Godfather-style crime family _ the kind of target the RICO law was written for 20 years ago. After <PERSON> Helmsley </PERSON> was found guilty of tax fraud, the hotel queen was charged in a civil racketeering lawsuit with taking millions from her ailing husband _ the type of case <ORGANIZATION> RICO </ORGANIZATION> opponents say the law was n't necessarily intended for. For the third time since 1986, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is considering a reform of the civil racketeering law, aimed at stripping provisions allowing triple damages and exempting the securities and commodities industries from its scope. One of the most contentious issues in business and legal circles today, the RICO ruckus pits a coalition of big business, labor and securities firms against consumer groups, state prosecutors and securities regulators. A Wall Street Journal editorial called civil RICO `` the most abusive legal invention since the Alien and Sedition Laws.'' Opponents quote cases from a divorce to a dispute over a rabbi. They say the law has been used to bludgeon large settlements from defendants, backlogged federal dockets and slandered businesses. `` You hate to tell your stockholders you're being sued in federal court as a racketeer,'' said <PERSON> Kim </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pearson </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> lawyer representing the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> in a coalition demanding reform. Defenders say RICO combats widespread business and securities fraud by providing a powerful economic deterrent. They reject the argument it encourages frivolous lawsuits. `` Silly RICO cases get thrown out by the courts,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Waldman </PERSON>, director of the consumer group <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citizen </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Watch </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` The issue is money. The issue is white-collar crime.'' `` They do n't want to pay treble damages in the cases in which people are responsible,'' added Notre Dame law professor <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Blakey </PERSON>, who helped draft the original racketeering statute. RICO was enacted in 1970 to attack organized crime. The civil side allows plaintiffs who show two racketeering acts in 10 years to sue for triple damages plus attorneys fees. Nothing limits its use to mobsters. Criminal RICO has received big publicity partly because prosecutors have used it to attack financial crime. Defendants risk minimum 20-year prison terms, $ 25,000 fines per count and forfeiture of assets before trial. A jury recently convicted six defendants in the first-ever use of RICO against securities professionals, the Princeton-Newport Partners tax fraud case. Bond financier <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> and dozens of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> commodity traders also face racketeering charges. RICO reformers are n't quibbling with these prosecutions. They're more concerned about its use in inheritance fights or squabbles between competitors, for example `` Civil RICO has been badly abused,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON>, D-Va., sponsor of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> reform bill `` It was designed to provide a remedy for people who were victimized by organized crime activities,'' he said. `` It has been used, however, almost exclusively in the context of ordinary business disputes.'' Uncertainty over the law limited the number of civil racketeering suits to about 500 until the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in 1985 upheld the statute and cases multiplied. The Administrative Office of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Courts says 1,049 civil RICO lawsuits were filed from July 1, 1988, to last June 30, about as many as in each of the previous two years. Still, that represents less than one-half of 1 percent of the total of 233,293 civil cases. Federal statistics show that in the 1987-88 period, the most recent available, 132 cases were settled without trial. Since 1985, experts say there have been only about 15 civil racketeering jury verdicts. Judges have dismissed the bulk of cases or ruled without a jury. <PERSON> Boucher </PERSON> claims the lure of triple damages `` makes civil RICO irresistible to any plaintiff who can meet the requirements,'' and that state-court fraud cases wind up in federal court. `` What that does is leverage very substantial settlements based on less than substantial allegations from a defendant who fears treble damages and also does n't want to be branded a racketeer,'' he said. It's difficult for RICO reformers to identify settlements reached to avoid a trial or threat of huge awards. Most cases they cited during congressional hearings this year dealt with allegedly abusive filings that were dismissed. In one, an <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> rock concert promoter sued another over use of an arena. Others include a free-lance reporter who sued <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> for failing to give him credit on a story, landlord-tenant disputes and allegations of fund-raising irregularities in <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON>'s presidential campaign. Pending civil cases include a $ 250 million class action suit and $ 1.1 billion government suit against defunct <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>; a $ 1 billion bond issue fraud suit by the <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Power </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supply </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION> against <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>; and suits charging abortion protesters in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> disrupted businesses and damaged property. Large settlements include $ 25 million paid by <ORGANIZATION> Ashland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in a case brought by two former executives who claimed they were fired for protesting alleged bribes to foreign officials, and a $ 15 million settlement by the accounting firm <ORGANIZATION> Laventhol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Horwath </ORGANIZATION> after it was convicted of aiding securities law violations by a financial promoter. Anti-RICO forces maintain that state laws and regulatory guidelines already cover abuses and protect defrauded consumers. `` The securities industry has had this unique case law that has developed over 50 years that has given these people means of recovery,'' said <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON>, senior vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>. `` There is no need for RICO.'' <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Watch </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Waldman </PERSON> countered: `` There is a white-collar crime wave going on in this country. It's hard to imagine how a lobbyist for Wall Street can say with a straight face that the existing laws are working well.'' The reform battle aside, both sides agree the law needs to better define racketeering. `` It's so vague that no one knows until after the fact what they are required to do to avoid violating the law,'' said <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> attorney <PERSON> Jed </PERSON> <PERSON> Rakoff </PERSON>, who represents <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> strikers suing management for racketeering. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> earlier this year practically invited a challenge to the law on grounds of vagueness. In a speech, Chief Justice <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON> criticized abusive filings and called for congressional action. `` Most of the civil suits filed under the statute have nothing to do with organized crime,'' he said. `` They are garden-variety civil fraud cases of the type traditionally litigated in state courts ... `` I think the time has arrived for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to enact amendments to civil RICO to limit its scope to the sort of wrongs that are connected to organized crime, or have some other reason for being in federal court.''

<TEXT>
 It's been 40 years since <PERSON> Kirk </PERSON> <PERSON> Kerkorian </PERSON> refurbished a small twin-engine airplane and began shuttling passengers between a <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> suburb and the fledgling gaming resort of <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>. In the years since then, the shy son of Armenian immigrants has built a billion-dollar business empire while forging grand designs in the desert. Now he's embarking on his grandest yet _ an entertainment theme park and his third shot at building the world's largest hotel. <PERSON> Kerkorian </PERSON>'s announcement Tuesday of plans to build the $ 700 million project on the <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> is a case of promises kept. `` I'll be back,'' Kerkot the eight largest hotels in the world _ three of them with the <PERSON> Kerkorian </PERSON> imprint. <PERSON> Kerkorian </PERSON> said Tuesday his <ORGANIZATION> MGM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grand </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, will build the hotel on a prime Strip corner now occupied by the Marina Hotel and Casino and the <ORGANIZATION> Tropicana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Country </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>. `` I used the word ` bullish' many years ago in talking about <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Kerkorian </PERSON> said. `` I'm still bullish on the city.'' The 115-acre theme park, still in its conceptual and design stage, will be a family attraction aimed at drawing middle-class tourists when it opens sometime in late 1992. MGM Grand chairman <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Benninger </PERSON> said his company is confident the park will cash in on the trend toward family tourism in a town once dominated by high-rolling gamblers. `` I remember the days when <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> lived almost entirely on the high roller,'' <PERSON> Benninger </PERSON> said Tuesday. `` You ca n't do that anymore.'' <PERSON> Kerkorian </PERSON>'s company built the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hotel </ORGANIZATION>, now the <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hilton </LOCATION>, and later built the MGM Grand Hotel, now <ORGANIZATION> Bally </ORGANIZATION>'s. The International had 1,500 rooms when it opened in 1967 as the biggest resort in <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> MGM </ORGANIZATION> surpassed that with 2,100 rooms when it was built in 1973. The Las Vegas Hilton now has 3,174 rooms and is the world's largest hotel That mark will be broken when the 4,032-room Excalibur opens next June, across the Strip from <PERSON> Kerkorian </PERSON>'s new site. The <ORGANIZATION> Hilton </ORGANIZATION>'s sister property, the <ORGANIZATION> Flamingo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hilton </ORGANIZATION>, will have 3,600 rooms when an expansion is completed next year. <PERSON> Kerkorian </PERSON> once owned the Flamingo as well. And he owned the land on which Caesars Palace was built. <PERSON> Kerkorian </PERSON> is expected to spend about $ 250 million on the new hotel and $ 450 million on the theme park, which will include facilities for film making. Some have compared <PERSON> Kerkorian </PERSON> with <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Hughes </PERSON>, the reclusive billionaire who once owned nine <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> hotel casinos and whose <ORGANIZATION> Summa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> still has vast real estate holdings in the <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Valley </LOCATION>. Both men had a penchant for the movie industry, gaming, flying, <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION>, airlines _ and privacy. <PERSON> Kerkorian </PERSON>, the son of poor Armenian fruit farmers in <LOCATION> Fresno </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, dropped out of high school to help support his parents and three brothers. He once attributed his business acumen to growing up during the Depression years. `` I did n't have any really big motivation in my life,'' he once said. `` First it was simply trying to earn enough to get something to eat, then enough to buy a car.'' In the late 1940s he refurbished a small plane and began carrying gamblers, sightseers and wedding couples from the <LOCATION> Hawthorne </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION> airport to <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>. In 1947 he formed his own airline, <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, which he later changed to <ORGANIZATION> Trans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. He sold the airline to <ORGANIZATION> TransAmerica </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in 1968 in a deal that netted him $ 104 million. By then he was in the hotel business in <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>, the city that `` has always been on the plus side for us.'' Today, <PERSON> Kerkorian </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> MGM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grand </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a separate company from his <ORGANIZATION> MGM-UA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, owns an all-frills <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles-New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> airline as well as the Desert Inn. It also retains rights to a stylized version of the famous MGM lion logo. <PERSON> Kerkorian </PERSON>, 72, had sold and bought back pieces of MGM-UA Communications for two decades, a period during which he also traded <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION> hotels the way most people buy cars. Last month, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Qintex </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> agreed to purchase <ORGANIZATION> MGM-UA </ORGANIZATION> _ including the original lion logo _ for $ 1.5 billion. <PERSON> Kerkorian </PERSON> continues to shun the spotlight and is reluctant to talk about his business success. `` I'm just a small town boy who got lucky,'' he says.

<HEAD>Small Service Stations Squeezed By EPA Rules On Storage Tanks</HEAD>

<BYLINE>By JULIA C. MARTINEZ</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 A spray-painted tin sign over <PERSON> Aldo </PERSON> <PERSON> Ranieri </PERSON>'s idle pumps hangs as an epitaph to a once-thriving business: `` NO GAS.'' <PERSON> Ranieri </PERSON> is one of more than 20,000 independent service station owners nationwide likely to go out of business because of new environmental safety rules concerning underground storage tanks. The potential closures represent almost a fifth of all <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> gasoline retail outlets, threatening to significantly narrow competition and raise prices, particularly in rural areas. Federal officials say the rules are aimed at protecting the environment from underground leaks that could contaminate water supplies. That's no consolation to people like <PERSON> Ranieri </PERSON>, who can not afford the enormous cost of replacing and insuring his tanks. `` Help, that's what I need, help,'' <PERSON> Ranieri </PERSON> says. After 25 years of pumping gasoline at the same location in an affluent <LOCATION> Westchester </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Ranieri </PERSON> says state officials forced him to stop selling gasoline four months ago when he refused to have his tanks tested at a cost of several thousand dollars. He has since laid off all but two employees, who continue to repair cars in the garage. The federal regulations require service station owners to replace or upgrade underground tanks by 1998. Before then they must test their tanks, install leak detection devices and prove, through pollution liability insurance or other means, that they can pay damages if there's a leak. Oct. 26 is the deadline for owners of between 100 and 999 tanks to have $ 1 million in insurance coverage to pay for possible leaks. Those who opt not to take the $ 1 million insurance generally must be able to show they have a minimum net worth of $ 10 million to cover the cost of cleaning a leak. With annual premiums more than doubling from an average of $ 25,356 in 1986 to $ 66,064 in 1989, industry officials say many station owners will not be able to comply by the deadline. `` Fifty-five percent of the people who should have insurance by Oct. 26 wo n't and the situation is getting worse,'' says <PERSON> Phillip </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Chisholm </PERSON>, executive vice president of the <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marketers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>. A joint survey by three trade associations representing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> gasoline marketers _ the petroleum marketers, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Convenience </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Society </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Gasoline </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marketers </ORGANIZATION> _ found that about 37,000 retailers with 100,000 tanks will likely miss the October deadline. Smaller owners like <PERSON> Ranieri </PERSON>, who own only a few tanks, have until October 1990 to get coverage. But they face a December deadline for testing tanks and installing leak detectors. <PERSON> Ranieri </PERSON> says he has asked <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> for help, since he sells the company's brand under a franchise, but has been turned down. He's now seeking a buyer. <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> concedes it has no program to help independent tank owners. `` It's their responsibility,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON>. He said <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> is considering assisting wholesalers with insurance costs. The <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marketers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> estimates that at least 26,250 of the nation's 150,000 gasoline stations could close over the next few years as a result of the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> rules. <PERSON> Ranieri </PERSON> says his tanks are at least 30 years old and need replacing. He estimates the cost could exceed $ 200,000 including compliance with state regulations that require installation of anti-vapor safety nozzles. `` I'm a little guy. For me to survive I have to replace the tanks. I do n't have the money,'' he says. Across the street at a <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION> station, business has picked up since <PERSON> Ranieri </PERSON>'s pumps closed. One recent weekday morning, a stream of cars pulled in and out almost nonstop. The few unwary motorists who drove into <PERSON> Ranieri </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> glimpsed the sign then wheeled over to the <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION> pumps. `` They're busy all the time,'' <PERSON> Ranieri </PERSON> says. `` I'm too small to fight. I ca n't fight the big guys.'' Owners of 1,000 or more tanks such as <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which operates the <ORGANIZATION> Mobil </ORGANIZATION> station, had to be in compliance by last January. Most large oil companies already are self insured. Since the rules went into effect last December, all tank owners are required to start testing the estimated 2 million underground oil and gasoline tanks nationwide. Up to half are believed to contain hazardous contaminants such as lead. `` Nobody is questioning the need for this,'' says <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Brand </PERSON>, director of <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s underground storage tank program. `` The issue is who pays, not whether we need it.'' Older storage tanks are made of carbon steel, which corrodes, and have typical design lives of 15-20 years. Products stored in leaky or corroding tanks seep into water and underground wells. Tanks installed since 1985 had to be constructed of protected steel, fiberglass or a sturdy composite, with non-corroding pipes. <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> McCormick </PERSON>, director of <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>'s Policy and Standards Division for underground storage tanks, says that leak damage often is underestimated. `` They're not Love Canals, they're much smaller but there are lots more of them,'' <PERSON> McCormick </PERSON> says. Up to 30 percent of the tanks could be leaking, although there is no reliable estimate of the extent of environmental harm, <PERSON> McCormick </PERSON> says. States such as <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, which started testing earlier than others, have found evidence of widespread leaks that range in size from trickles to thousands of gallons. <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> officials say they are trying to ease the burden of the new regulations by phasing in the rules and giving special consideration to problem cases. One provision, for example, enables <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> Commissioner <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Reilly </PERSON> to suspend enforcement of the insurance deadline for six months if coverage is not available, <PERSON> Brand </PERSON> says. But tank owners should not depend on the provision, <PERSON> Brand </PERSON> says, because `` we do n't have evidence that it's not available.'' The petroleum marketers group has asked the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> to suspend the compliance date for one year, arguing that many insurance companies remain reluctant to provide coverage before tanks are upgraded. Other insurers require $ 100,000 deductibles, <PERSON> Chisholm </PERSON> says. Industry sources say that some banks also are reluctant to lend money for tank upgrades because they consider it a high-risk loan, so many tank owners are in a Catch 22 situation. While some states are coming to the rescue by establishing trust funds to help owners upgrade tanks and cover the major portion of spills, only a few have been approved by the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> so far. `` The way I see it I'm out of business,'' says <PERSON> Ranieri </PERSON>.

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Investor <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Checchi </PERSON> says he wo n't get a new partner to make up the $ 225 million from <ORGANIZATION> KLM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dutch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> that the federal government ruled out as part of the takeover of <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> by a Checchi-led group. The <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> last week gave <PERSON> Checchi </PERSON> six months to cut <ORGANIZATION> KLM </ORGANIZATION>'s investment to $ 175 million from $ 400 million, which had been the largest equity contribution to the deal to buy <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION>, the parent of <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. The department said it was worried that <ORGANIZATION> KLM </ORGANIZATION> could control the airline even though it held only 5 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>'s shares. In an interview with the <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> published Wednesday, <PERSON> Checchi </PERSON> said, `` I'm not entertaining the thought of taking on another partner. That would n't make sense.'' Instead, the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> financier said, he plans to repay <ORGANIZATION> KLM </ORGANIZATION> the $ 225 million from <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION>'s cash flow, or by issuing nonvoting preferred stock, or possibly by letting employees buy into the company. <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> already has reduced its takeover-related debt from $ 3.35 billion to $ 3.1 billion, said <PERSON> Checchi </PERSON>. The group led by <PERSON> Checchi </PERSON>, including <ORGANIZATION> KLM </ORGANIZATION> and other investors, bought <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> for $ 3.65 billion in June. <PERSON> Checchi </PERSON> replaced <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Rothmeier </PERSON> as <ORGANIZATION> NWA </ORGANIZATION> chairman last week.

<HEAD>Skinner Defends Order Limiting KLM's Participation in Northwest Takeover</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT GREENE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Transportation Secretary <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> said Wednesday he was not ushering in new re-regulation of the airline industry with a consent order restricting a Dutch airline's participation in the buyout of <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> Appearing before <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> subcommittees looking into leveraged buyouts and foreign ownership in the airline industry, <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> said his decision to restrict the buyout of <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> by <ORGANIZATION> Wings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Holdings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> _ in which <ORGANIZATION> KLM </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dutch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> has a major investment _ was based on existing law. He defended the influx of foreign capital and the use of buyouts to `` recapitalize'' a company when the value of assets _ such as airplanes and various rights _ exceeds the value of company shares. `` But when they turn to highly leveraged, that's bad,'' he said. In a leveraged buyout, the new owners pay for the company by borrowing against its assets. To pay off the debt, they often have to break up the company and sell off parts of it. <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> said that in highly leveraged buyouts, the debt service can detract from important investments in safety and an up-to-date fleet. Two aviation subcommittees are discussing proposed legislation that would make it more difficult for airlines to be acquired through leveraged buyouts. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> version addresses foreign investments as well. <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON>, although officially undecided on either <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> or <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> proposal, said he felt that the law already gives the department authority to act when it questions the fitness of the airline to operate as a result of a takeover. Although the <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> case `` would procedurally have been cleaner'' had it been done earlier with specific guidelines, too many laws on the books make it easier for lawyers and entrepreneurs to find loopholes, he said. `` It's more difficult to unwind a transaction that has already been put together than it is to be there from the beginning,'' <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> said, but he added that `` it is not our intention'' to reintroduce regulation. He disagreed with a specific proposal in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> bill that would allow no buyout that raised the debt-equity ratio beyond 1:1 in takeovers, saying the ratio had to be examined individually in each instance. That ratio does n't exist with airlines in operation. Foreign ownership of airlines is limited under the Federal Aviation Act. Although the provisions of the KLM-Northwestern deal did not meet the literal guidelines, <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> said it was clear that foreign control was an issue. On Friday, the department announced that the new partners in the deal would cut <ORGANIZATION> KLM </ORGANIZATION>'s interest from 57 percent to 25 percent. <ORGANIZATION> KLM </ORGANIZATION> would keep a seat on the 12-member board but would have to excuse itself from decisions involving competition. Also, the partners agreed to eliminate a three-member advisory committee that <ORGANIZATION> KLM </ORGANIZATION> would have controlled. The $ 705 million leveraged buyout, announced in June, is the largest in the airline industry, <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> said, and proposed a fourfold increase in the company's long-term debt. The foreign ownership provision is to protect the ability of civilian airlines to function in wartime emergencies, such as the transport of troops. `` It is important if not imperative,'' that the foreign ownership rule be enforced because of that consideration, he said. <PERSON> Skinner </PERSON> said he was particularly concerned about the idea of having a <ORGANIZATION> KLM </ORGANIZATION> board member on the <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> board when the two airlines would be technically in competition.

 <ORGANIZATION> Burroughs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wellcome </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> has introduced its anti-AIDS drug in a strawberry-flavored syrup to help patients who have difficulty swallowing. The syrup form of Retrovir _ the brand name for AZT _ is expected to be available in pharmacies within four to six weeks, company officials say. `` This new formulation should provide more flexibility in making dosage adjustments and be particularly useful to patients who have difficulty swallowing capsules for a variety of reasons, including lesions in the throat and mouth,'' said <PERSON> Kathryn </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pattishall </PERSON>, project leader for Retrovir at <ORGANIZATION> Burroughs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wellcome </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Bartlett </PERSON>, a spokewoman for <ORGANIZATION> Burroughs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wellcome </ORGANIZATION>, said the syrup would also help doctors adjust the dosage. AZT capsules were approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> in March 1987, and the syrup received approval last month. AZT was rushed into production in 1986 after only nine months of clinical tests, when preliminary results showed 8 percent of patients died while taking the drug, compared with 40 percent in a similar test group not given the drug. AZT is the only drug approved by the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> that directly combats the AIDS virus. <ORGANIZATION> Burroughs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wellcome </ORGANIZATION> last month cut its wholesale price by 20 percent in response to complaints that the retail price, $ 7,000 to $ 8,000 for a year's treatment, was too high.

<HEAD>Defense Electronics Should Prosper Despite Pentagon Cuts, Study Says</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Within 10 years, <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> spending will return to its level before the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's defense buildup, according to a study by leaders of the defense electronics industry. But defense electronics will still get a healthy cut of defense funds, said officials of the <ORGANIZATION> Electronics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, meeting in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. `` Defense electronics, despite a declining overall budget, is holding its own as a quality enhancer for most weapon systems,'' said <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentley </PERSON>, chairman of an <ORGANIZATION> EIA </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee that compiled the organization's annual 10-year forecast. `` In fact, over the 10-year period, defense electronics will show real growth.'' Industry officials presented the study Tuesday at the conference, which attracted more than 350 defense industry executives and managers from across the country. The 90-page study, drawn from interviews with industry executives, congressional sources, <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> officials, academics and Wall Street analysts, says inflation will outpace the overall defense budget. Although the budget is expected to reach as much as $ 375 billion by the end of the 1990s, it will actually shrink 1.5 percent when adjusted for inflation in 1990 dollars, <PERSON> Bentley </PERSON> said. `` We are looking at 12 straight years of real decline, which will bring us back to the early <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> years and fiscal 1981,'' he said. Officials warned, however, that a loss of power by Soviet President <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and a return by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to policies of the past could result in a change in the entire equation. Barring such a change, cutbacks in big-ticket items such as military personnel, missiles, tanks and aircraft appear inevitable, association officials said. But military spending will remain strong for defense electronics in areas such as space, communications equipment, high-tech improvements in missiles and aircraft and other weaponry.

 The stock market climbed to record highs for the second straight session today, following through on Tuesday's sharp gain. Analysts noted some `` catch-up'' buying by investors who were caught off guard by the market's revived rally this week. The new advance in stock prices was attributed in large measure to persistent strength in the dollar and declining interest rates. Talk began stirring in the financial world early this week that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> might soon find room to relax its credit policy further, prompted by slow-to-moderate economic growth and favorable inflation news. Interest rates levelled off in the credit markets today. But after hesitating for the first two hours of the session, stocks began forging ahead again.

 Sales of North American-built cars and trucks by the nation's Big Three automakers jumped 10 percent in late September, due in large part to a 45.3 percent rise in <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> truck sales, the companies said Wednesday. For the entire model year, which ended Sept. 30, combined sales of cars and trucks assembled in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> by <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> were up a more modest 0.1 percent compared with the previous year, which proved to be the third-best model year on record for automakers as a whole. The companies said they sold vehicles at an average daily rate of 42,407 during the Sept. 21-30 period this year, compared with a daily rate of 38,550 during the same time last year. Car sales rose 7.2 percent and truck sales, fueled by the big <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> increase, rose 14.8 percent. In September, <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> was offering its dealers incentives to sell the company's trucks, including pickups, sport-utility vehicles and minivans. That helped push <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s light truck sales for the entire month up 42.3 percent over September 1988. For the model year, <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> trucks sales were up 6.1 percent over last year. For the model year, which began Oct. 1, 1988, truck sales by the Big Three were up 2.2 percent, offsetting a 1.1 percent decline in car sales. <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> also posted strong late-September car sales figures, rising 13.7 percent to an average daily sales rate of 14,660 during the period this year from a rate of 12,892 last year. For the first nine months of the 1989 calendar year, <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>'s car sales were down 5.6 percent and for the model year, car sales were up 3.2 percent. While <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION> was gaining truck sales in late September, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> was losing. The nation's No. 2 automaker said its late-September light truck sales were off 9 percent. For the calendar year, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s truck sales were down 2.1 percent and for the model year, they were off 1.8 percent. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s car sales were up 6 percent in late September and 0.2 percent for the calendar year. For the 1989 model year, <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s car sales were up 3.2 percent. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>, like <ORGANIZATION> GM </ORGANIZATION>, showed an increase in truck sales, but not nearly as dramatic. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION> said its late-September light truck sales were up 6 percent over the same time last year, and up 0.1 for the calendar year to date. For the model year, truck sales were up 1.6 percent. <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s car sales dropped 12.6 percent in late September, and, through Sept. 30 of this calendar year, the company's car sales were off 11.2 percent. For the just-ended model year, <ORGANIZATION> Chrysler </ORGANIZATION>'s car sales were down 7.5 percent compared with last year.

<HEAD>Coffee Futures Sink To New 14-Year Low</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>

<TEXT>
 World coffee prices sank to new 14-year lows Wednesday amid deepening pessimism about the prospects for a return to the price-support measures abandoned by the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coffee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> in July. On other commodity markets, sugar futures climbed sharply, precious metals were higher, energy futures mostly were lower and grain and livestock futures were mixed. Coffee futures settled 2.5 cents to 3.7 cents lower on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Coffee, <ORGANIZATION> Sugar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Cocoa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> with the contract for delivery in December at 73.03 cents a pound, the lowest settlement for a near-month coffee contract since late 1975. The <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coffee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION>'s latest indicator of the average price of coffee traded throughout the world, released Wednesday, was 64.31 cents a pound, also a 14-year low. Market analysts called the sell-off a continuation of Tuesday's steep slide, which was triggered when <PERSON> Jorio </PERSON> <PERSON> Dauster </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>'s chief coffee executive, said there was no chance of an early return to an export quota system designed to keep excess world production off the market A new coffee agreement is impossible without support from <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION>, the world's largest coffee producer. Coffee futures prices have plunged about 36 percent in the three months since the <ORGANIZATION> ICO </ORGANIZATION> suspended the quotas because of dissatisfaction among its largest consumer members, including the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dauster </PERSON> made his remarks at an <ORGANIZATION> ICO </ORGANIZATION> meeting in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> that is scheduled to end Friday. Key producer members of the 74-nation group reportedly were drafting a resolution Wednesday on how to proceed with negotiations on a new agreement but analysts said they expected no movement in the near future. `` Unless it's radical surgery, it's difficult to see how anything that comes out of the meeting in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> is anything more than window dressing,'' said <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevenson </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Prudential-Bache </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Many analysts predicted prices would drop further. But some said roaster buying for the winter season, when coffee consumption reaches its annual peak, should surface within the next two weeks to slow or halt the slide. World sugar futures soared on the Coffee, <ORGANIZATION> Sugar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Cocoa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> amid indications that <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> had made a major sugar purchase. Sugar settled .31 cent to .75 cent higher with January at 13.85 cents a pound. Gold and silver futures posted modest gains in quiet trading on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Gold settled 10 cents to 20 cents higher with October at $ 367 a troy ounce; silver was 2.8 cents to 3.1 cents higher with December at $ 5.328 a troy ounce. Gasoline led most energy futures lower on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> in reaction to Tuesday's weekly <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> report showing increased <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> supplies of crude, gasoline and petroleum distillates. West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 11 cents lower to 2 cents higher with November at $ 20.15 a barrel; heating oil was .10 cent to .69 cent lower with November at 58.99 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .40 cent to 1.23 cents lower with November at 55.41 cents a gallon. Grain and soybean futures finished mixed on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION> as harvest-related selling offset buying linked to new export sales of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat and corn. Wheat futures settled -LCB- cent lower to 2 cents higher with December at $ 4.09 \ a bushel; corn was 1 -LCB- cents lower to -LCB- cent higher with December at $ 2.39 a bushel; oats were -LCB- cent to 1 -LCB- cents lower with December at $ 1.46 \ a bushel; soybeans were 1 -RCB- cents lower to -RCB- cent higher with November at $ 5.76 -LCB- a Profit-taking pressured pork futures on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> while slack beef demand weighed on live cattle futures. But strong cash markets boosted feeder cattle. Live cattle settled unchanged to .30 cent lower with October at 71.05 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .10 cent to .40 cent higher with October at 83.15 cents a pound; live hogs were .10 cent to .63 cent lower with October at 44.77 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .33 cent to .88 cent lower with February at 48.17 cents a pound.

 The dollar was mixed against major currencies in fairly quiet trading Wednesday with traders cautious ahead of the meeting of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s central bank. Some analysts expect the <ORGANIZATION> Bundesbank </ORGANIZATION> to raise its key lending rates when it meets Thursday in an effort to push the dollar lower. Its discount rate now stands at 5 percent and the Lombard rate is at 7 percent. `` All eyes are watching the <ORGANIZATION> Bundesbank </ORGANIZATION> tomorrow,'' said <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Holzer </PERSON>, chief currency broker for <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> is one of seven industrial nations, including the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, that have joined in a concerted effort to weaken the dollar. Analysts said that if intervention fails the backup plan is for some countries to raise their interest rates. Higher West German interest rates would make mark-denominated assets more attractive than dollar holdings and would tend to boost the mark against the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar. If the <ORGANIZATION> Bundesbank </ORGANIZATION> decides to raise interest rates other central banks probably will follow, analysts said. `` If the Germans do it, it will be a matter of time before <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> does it not only to show coordinated effort politically but also to bolster the yen,'' said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Barbanel </PERSON>, currency analyst with <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Global </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Asset </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION>. Some analysts said the currency markets have already come to expect a half-percentage-point rise so the <ORGANIZATION> Bundesbank </ORGANIZATION> will have to kick rates higher to lower the dollar. `` If they raise it only a half-percentage-point it will take a lot of the sparkle out of the Deutsche mark and other currencies that it has appreciated against,'' <PERSON> Holzer </PERSON> said. Central banks began their intervention more than a week ago after a meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seven </ORGANIZATION> industrialized nations in which they agreed that the dollar's recent rise was `` inconsistent'' with longer-run economic fundamentals. They are the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, the dollar fell 0.05 yen to a closing 140.60 yen. Later, in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, it was quoted at 141.05 yen. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the dollar traded at 141.475, up from 141.20 late Tuesday. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the pound traded at $ 1.6055, unchanged from late Tuesday. In <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> trading the dollar strengthened as the pound changed hands at $ 1.6020, down from $ 1.6045 late Tuesday. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, compared with late Monday's rates, included: 1.8815 West German marks, down from 1.8865; 1.6290 Swiss francs, down from 1.6350; 1.17475 Canadian dollars, down from 1.17495; 6.3825 French francs, down from 6.4000; and 1,376.75 Italian lire, down from 1,379.65 Late dollar rates in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> compared with late Tuesday's prices, included: 1.8770 West German marks, down from 1.8865; 1.6275 Swiss francs, down from 1.6350; 6.3700 French francs, down from 6.4005; 2.1185 Dutch guilders, down from 2.1195; 1,373.50 Italian lire, down from 1,380.50; and 1.1742 Canadian dollars, down from 1.1763. Gold traded in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> late Wednesday at $ 366.25 per troy ounce, up slightly from late Tuesday's $ 365.50. In <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, the bid price was $ 366, up from $ 365.25 late Tuesday. Gold closed in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> unchanged at $ 366.50. On the Commodity Exchange in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, gold bullion for current delivery closed at $ 367 an ounce, up from $ 366.30 on Tuesday. Republic National bank of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> said gold was bid late in the day at $ 366 an ounce, up from $ 365.50 on Tuesday.

 A bill approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> early Wednesday would give more than 100 years of amnesty to fraternal groups, taverns and convenience stores for past-due levies under a little-known tax on liquor retailers. Protests over the tax had grown after a <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> Elks lodge got a $ 9,000 bill for 50 years of non-payment. The measure would prohibit the federal government from collecting unpaid balances and penalties on the 123-year-old tax if they accrued before Jan. 1, 1985, according to Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON>, R-Pa. <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON>, a member of the committee, argued successfully to get the provision included in a sweeping budget bill Both the provision and the bill were approved on voice votes. Although the tax has been in the books since 1866, the <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alcohol </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Firearms </ORGANIZATION> says that up to 40 percent of retailers never heard of it until the agency began a vigorous collection effort last year. The crackdown began after <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> raised the yearly tax 363 percent, from $ 54 to $ 250 for each establishment. <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON> estimated his amendment would cost the government about $ 2 million per year in lost revenues through the 1994 fiscal year. According to bureau spokesman <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Killorin </PERSON>, the list of organizations liable for the tax includes some country clubs, lodges, limousine operators and even bait and tackle shops _ any organization that sells beer, wine and distilled spirits directly to the public. In all, <PERSON> Killorin </PERSON> estimates that 600,000 organizations must pay the `` special occupational tax.'' Responsibility for collections shifted to jthe <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alcohol </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tobacco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Firearms </ORGANIZATION> in 1986 from the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Killorin </PERSON> said in a recent interview that the bureau was working with states to make certain retailers aware of their obligations. He said the agency was willing to negotiate payment plans so retailers can get their debt paid off. Opposition to the collection effort gained momentum in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> after Elks Lodge 109 in <LOCATION> Wilkes-Barre </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, received a bill 11 months ago for $ 9,776.98 from the bureau, representing unpaid taxes and penalties back to 1940 when the lodge got its liquor license. The Elks, who said they had never heard of the tax, complained to Rep. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Kanjorski </PERSON>, D-Pa., who said in an interview Wednesday that he has been fighting for a statute of limitations on the tax because the establishments being dunned include `` the small tap rooms, the private clubs _ people who can least afford to pay a tax they knew nothing about for years and years. <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Dot </PERSON> <PERSON> Koester </PERSON> said Wednesday that the agency was taking no position on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> committee action. `` Whatever <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> passes, we'll enforce. It wo n't be a problem for us,'' she said. The <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> Elks lodge, which is celebrating its 100th anniversary, recently settled with the bureau for $ 844.12, lodge attorney <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Olszewski </PERSON> said Wednesday. The lodge argued that it had not been open and functioning during part of the period for which it was being taxed. But if the committee-passed provision becomes law, <PERSON> Olszewski </PERSON> said the lodge might petition <ORGANIZATION> ATF </ORGANIZATION> for a refund. `` You can call this the ` Elks Lodge Bill.' I think there would be a tremendous amount of satisfaction to see <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> remedy an administrative problem,'' <PERSON> Olszewski </PERSON> said <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON>'s amendment was included in a sweeping bill designed to make changes in the law to achieve the budget target set by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> at the beginning of the fiscal year. <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON> said in a statement Wednesday that the provision `` provides reasonable relief to many retailers, most of whom are small businesses and had no intention of evading a tax.'' The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Means </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> failed to include a provision similar to <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON>'s in its corresponding bill. Assuming passage by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, the matter would be resolved by a <ORGANIZATION> House-Senate </ORGANIZATION> conference committee.

<HEAD>Bond Prices Dip</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Government bond prices finished slightly lower Wednesday as trading slowed in advance of an important economic report later this week on employment in September. The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>'s benchmark 30-year bond lost 1-16 point, or about 63 cents for every $ 1,000 in face amount. Its yield held steady at 8.16 percent, unchanged from late Tuesday. Corporate issues also dipped, but tax-exempt municipals advanced. Market watchers said dealings were listless for most of the day as traders were reluctant to make large commitments to either buy or sell bonds in advance of Friday's scheduled release of the September employment report. Some analysts were looking for payroll growth of about 275,000 compared with growth of about 110,000 in August. That would suggest continued vitality in the economy and some analysts said they doubted that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> would adjust its monetary policy as a result of that type of figure. In the secondary market for <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bonds, prices of short-term, intermediate and long-term governments were all down by between 1-16 point and 3-32 point, the <ORGANIZATION> Telerate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> financial information service reported. The movement of a point equals a change of $ 10 in the price of a bond with a $ 1,000 face value. The <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Bond Index, which measures price movements on all outstanding <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> issues with maturities of a year or longer, lost 0.72 to 1,174.05. <ORGANIZATION> Moody </ORGANIZATION>'s Investment Grade Corporate Bond Index, which measures total return on a portfolio of 80 corporate bonds with maturities of five years or longer, fell 0.08 to 329.70. But in the tax-exempt market, the Bond Buyer index of 40 actively traded municipal bonds rose 3-16 to 92 -LRB-. The average yield to maturity fell to 7.38 percent from 7.40 percent late Tuesday. Yields on three-month <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bills rose to 8.04 percent as the discount gained 3 basis points to 7.78 percent. Yields on six-month bills rose to 8.30 percent as the discount advanced 4 basis points to 7.87 percent. Yields on one-year bills rose to 8.38 percent as the discount rose 2 basis points to 7.79 percent. A basis point is one-hundredth of a percentage point. The yield is the annualized return on an investment in a <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> bill. The discount is the percentage that bills are selling below the face value, paid at maturity. The federal funds rate, the interest on overnight loans between banks, was quoted at 8 \ percent, down from 9 percent late Tuesday But analysts said the relatively low funds rate was due to technical conditions in the short-term market for bank borrowings as Wednesday marked the end of a bank reserve reporting period.

<HEAD>Times Herald Asks FCC to Revoke Belo Station's License</HEAD>

<DATELINE>DALLAS (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> turned to federal regulators Wednesday in its war with rival <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION>, asking them to revoke the license of a television station owned by the parent company of The Morning News. The <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> asked the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> to revoke <ORGANIZATION> WFAA-TV </ORGANIZATION>'s license because of <ORGANIZATION> A.H. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Belo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>'s `` naked and unjustifiable'' actions in stripping the <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> of 26 popular features it had been purchasing from <ORGANIZATION> Universal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Syndicate </ORGANIZATION>. Belo General Counsel <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> McCarthy </PERSON> declined to comment on the action, citing the <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION>'s pending lawsuit on some of the same issues. `` We fully expect to be vindicated in trial,'' he said. As part of a joint venture between <PERSON> Belo </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Universal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>, the larger Morning News won exclusive right in the <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> market to the syndicate's features, which include Doonesbury, <PERSON> Erma </PERSON> <PERSON> Bombeck </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dear </PERSON> <PERSON> Abby </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> has lost previous attempts in federal and state court to block the action, and most of the features have begun appearing in The Morning News. A trial on the <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION>'s antitrust suit against <PERSON> Belo </PERSON> and Universal is pending in state <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> `` Belo has used its newspaper-television combination to engage in conduct that severely undermines competition between the <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> Morning News and the <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION>,'' says the petition to the FCC. The <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> has outlawed joint newspaper-television ownership since 1975, but allowed such ownership to continue in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> and other cities where it already was in place. <ORGANIZATION> WFAA </ORGANIZATION> is the leading television station in the <LOCATION> Dallas-Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> market. Under the joint venture announced in August, <PERSON> Belo </PERSON> and Universal agreed to explore television programming possibilities for some of the syndicate's features, and Belo President <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheehan </PERSON> described the exclusivity clause as `` really secondary.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION> petition said the joint venture `` is nothing more than a sham to cover <PERSON> Belo </PERSON>'s real agenda, the elimination of its only competitor in the <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> newspaper market.'' The petition says <PERSON> Belo </PERSON>'s $ 1 million payment to <ORGANIZATION> Universal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> for the features `` suggests that <PERSON> Belo </PERSON> is paying not for the right to produce new video products, but rather for a monopoly of the <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> newspaper market.'' <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> Publisher <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Buzzetta </PERSON> said the petition was filed reluctantly. `` We like competition, but we want to compete fairly and honestly and insist that our competitor do the same,'' <PERSON> Buzzetta </PERSON> said in a news release. The two papers have fought bitterly during the past few years, even challenging each other's circulation figures in court. <PERSON> Edyth </PERSON> <PERSON> Wise </PERSON>, chief of the complaints and investigations branch in the enforcement division of <ORGANIZATION> FCC </ORGANIZATION>, said `` we operate totally on a complaint basis. Every action -LRB- on revocation -RRB- is on the basis of a complaint, by listeners and frequently by competitors.'' A complaint by a newspaper against a television station, however, `` frankly that's unusual,'' she said, `` although they're free to do it.

 <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Chairman <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> said Wednesday that <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> is continuing to recover from a bitter strike and will emerge from bankruptcy proceedings as a better carrier `` The rebuilding of Eastern is on target,'' <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> said at the annual Airport Operators Council International Conference. Eastern's Machinists, pilots and flight attendants went on strike March 4, forcing the Miami-based carrier to file for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Eastern and Houston-based <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> are both subsidiaries of <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>, which also is based in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>. `` We're bringing Eastern back sounder, stronger and better than it's been in years,'' <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> told a luncheon at a <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> hotel. Next year `` will be a great year for Eastern,'' he said. `` Its reorganization will be behind us. The airline will be providing aggressive, competitive service up and down the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>, in and out of <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> and throughout <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. `` This past weekend we added another 100 flights, bringing us to about 70 percent of the pre-strike <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>, or about 700 flights a day,'' he said. `` And I do n't mind telling you that by December, we'll be over 80 percent of the pre-strike airline.'' But of the estimated 3,000 pre-strike pilots, <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> said, `` there's probably going to be 2,000 pilots who may never see <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> again because they were misguided and brainwashed by a national organization that has refused to face up to where we are today, and indeed, has tried to take over control of <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> in an illegal way.'' <PERSON> Lorenzo </PERSON> also discussed the domestic airline industry, and the need for carriers to be free to finance their needs. There is an important link, he said, between the globalization of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> airlines and the current concern by some over leveraged buyouts and foreign investment in American carriers.

 Before a background that included jewelry and a clock purportedly made of a dismantled SS-20 missile, the Soviet Consulate was the setting Wednesday for the announcement of a joint venture to put Soviet products on sale in exclusive shops in both countries. `` This is an attempt to show that working for peace is profitable,'' Soviet Consul General <PERSON> Valentin </PERSON> <PERSON> Kamenev </PERSON> told a crowd of reporters nibbling on cabbage-stuffed piroshikis out of the consul's kitchen. `` We are going in the right direction.'' <PERSON> Kamenev </PERSON> and <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> socialite <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Montandon </PERSON>, who has been waging a U.S.-Soviet peace movement of her own for eight years, said the `` make peace profitable'' venture will install `` perestroika'' shops around this country to exclusively handle a variety of products from the <LOCATION> U.S.S.R. </LOCATION> `` The climate for that, in Soviet-American relations, has never been better,'' remarked <PERSON> Kamenev </PERSON>. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Montandon </PERSON> and Associates and the Soviet producers are to share in any profits from the sale of the goods that will be available in both countries, she said. The flagship shop of 3,000 square feet is scheduled to open in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> in the spring and investors are being sought, she said. At one point <PERSON> Montandon </PERSON> modeled a decorated woman's jacket made from the top of a <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> uniform. In a self-financed program called `` Children as Peacemakers,'' <PERSON> Montandon </PERSON> estimated she has escorted some 200 youngsters to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in 22 trips since 1982. The announcement reported that three ventures, the first involving the 150-branch <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> U.S.S.R. </ORGANIZATION>, will do business with the <PERSON> Montandon </PERSON> group, called PMA. <ORGANIZATION> PMA </ORGANIZATION> and the committee, she said, plan to bring to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> goods including <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> uniforms and artifacts manufactured from weapons disarmed by U.S.-Soviet agreement. Another agreement involves the manufacture of a line of cosmetics and health-care products to satisfy needs of <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> women, she said. The cosmetics, declared <PERSON> Montandon </PERSON>, will include `` a secret Soviet ingredient from the <LOCATION> Caucasus </LOCATION>, where it is common for people to live more than 100 years.'' The third pact involves Soviet sculptor <PERSON> Zurab </PERSON> <PERSON> Tserteli </PERSON>, who has agreed to allow the <PERSON> Montandon </PERSON> group to be his agent in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The artist, winner of the Lenin Prize, is to make available for export art work of his colleagues in the Georgian Union of Designers. <PERSON> Montandon </PERSON> made an impassioned plea for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to lower tariffs on Soviet imports. She said current <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> policy amounts to a trade barrier to Soviet-American business relationships. There are currently more than 900 joint ventures between the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and other countries. Less than 40 of them are with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.

 The $ 50 billion <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> voted two months ago to rescue failed savings institutions may not be enough, a top regulator said Wednesday, raising the possibility that taxpayers could be asked for a second bailout. <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Deposit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>. Chairman <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON>, whose agency is in charge of disposing of bankrupt thrifts, told the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Banking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> it is much too early to reliably predict the cost of the bailout But, he said, `` it is possible that $ 50 billion will prove to be an insufficient amount to deal with potential failures.'' His comments, included in written testimony to the panel, which is taking <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' first look at the bailout since it was enacted Aug. 9, are the strongest yet from a government official. Private analysts have been saying for months that the $ 50 billion likely will prove to be only a down payment. <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Resolution </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, operated by the <ORGANIZATION> FDIC </ORGANIZATION> to dispose of failed S & amp; Ls, expects losses on the 283 seized by regulators so far to total $ 35 billion. By the time the bailout ends in August 1992, regulators may have seized as many as 300 more dead S & amp; Ls, bringing the total to nearly 600, he said. Those projections `` raise questions about the adequacy of the $ 50 billion in <ORGANIZATION> RTC </ORGANIZATION> funding.'' However, <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, who heads an administration board overseeing the <ORGANIZATION> RTC </ORGANIZATION>'s performance, said `` I know of nothing that's occurred since the bill passed to change my mind'' that $ 50 billion likely is sufficient. That `` is n't the point. Maybe we need 52, maybe we need 48. The point is we've taken a bonfire and tamped it down to the point where it's embers,'' <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON>, answering questions from senators, softened his tone a bit, emphasizing the impossibility of making a certain loss estimate. Nevertheless, he said, `` there's no way we can say for sure that $ 50 billion is enough.'' On a related matter, he said the <ORGANIZATION> RTC </ORGANIZATION> may have to borrow $ 25 billion or more, in addition to the $ 50 billion, to provide working cash until it can recover money by selling loans and real estate once owned by failed S & amp; Ls. Congress authorized the extra borrowing, but Sen. <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Riegle </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, D-Mich., chairman of the banking committee, said $ 25 billion was far more than envisioned So far, the <ORGANIZATION> RTC </ORGANIZATION> has run through $ 20 billion: $ 1.8 billion to close 24 small <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Ls, $ 8.3 billion to handle five large institutions by next week and five smaller not-yet-completed deals, $ 8.5 billion to replace high-cost deposits and $ 1.4 billion as a reserve fund to handle liquidity problems at thrifts that have failed but are still open, <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON> said. Deputy Treasury Secretary <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Robson </PERSON> said the inability to close the five big cases by Sept. 30, the last day of fiscal 1989, means the reported federal budget deficit will be about $ 8 billion higher in fiscal 1990. However, he said that would not trigger automatic spending cuts under the Gramm-Rudman law. The 1990 budget estimate taken for determining those cuts was made on Aug. 15, he said. Meanwhile, both <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> and <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON> reassured committee members, alarmed by the scandal at the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Housing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION>, that they are working to prevent similar abuses from developing at the <ORGANIZATION> RTC </ORGANIZATION>. `` I think we've learned from the mistakes of the past,'' added Housing Secretary <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Kemp </PERSON>, a member of <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>'s oversight panel. <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> RTC </ORGANIZATION> last week issued an interim ethics code governing the thousands of independent contractors it is expected to hire to manage the real estate and other assets it is inheriting from the thrifts. Both <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> and <PERSON> Seidman </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> RTC </ORGANIZATION> and the oversight panel chaired by <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> were working well together despite initial tensions. `` No joint enterprise of any magnitude is without its healthy frictions, and ours is no exception,'' <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> said. `` But overall we have gotten off to an excellent start.'' At a separate hearing held by a 17-member <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Banking task force, Rep. <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> McMillen </PERSON>, D-Md., complained about <ORGANIZATION> RTC </ORGANIZATION> projections that it would swell from 1,150 employees currently to between 5,000 and 10,000 `` No one intended this legislation to create a big bureaucracy. ... -LRB- That's -RRB- the last thing in the world I want,'' he said. <ORGANIZATION> RTC </ORGANIZATION> Executive Director <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooke </PERSON> said his agency likely will handle in excess of $ 300 billion assets, about a third of that difficult to sell. If the <ORGANIZATION> RTC </ORGANIZATION> eventually has as many as 10,000 employees, that's only one employee managing every $ 10 million in assets, he said.

<HEAD>Machinists Shun United Buyout Plan</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>' largest union, the Machinists, on Wednesday formally rejected an offer to join the proposed $ 6.75 billion pilot-management buyout of <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>'s parent company. The <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aerospace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> had repeatedly expressed its opposition to the proposed leveraged buyout of Chicago-based <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> by its employees and management, saying it could endanger the nation's second-largest airline. But it had not issued a formal answer until the announcement from vice president <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Peterpaul </PERSON>. `` After a thorough study of the proposed plan and after meeting with company officials, the <ORGANIZATION> IAM </ORGANIZATION> will go forth with normal negotiations as it would with any other carrier,'' <PERSON> Peterpaul </PERSON> said. `` We do not feel that <ORGANIZATION> IAM </ORGANIZATION> members' interest would be well served by participating in the <ORGANIZATION> ESOP </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- employee stock ownership plan -RRB- program.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Machinists </ORGANIZATION> union represents 25,000 of <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION>'s 70,000 employees. Its contract becomes amendable at the end of this month. <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> said in a statement that the Machinists' decision was consistent with its `` previously announced and often repeated position.'' But the company said the <ORGANIZATION> IAM </ORGANIZATION> decision `` does not change the benefits that flow to <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION>'s employees from ownership of their company _ benefits we hope will be shared by all employees.'' And the company indicated it would continue to woo Machinists members, saying `` we would welcome the participation of our employees represented by the <ORGANIZATION> IAM </ORGANIZATION>, and are prepared to continue to explore ways to achieve that objective.'' The $ 300-a-share plan calls for <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> workers to own 75 percent of the company. A management group headed by <ORGANIZATION> UAL </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON> would own 10 percent and the remaining 15 percent would be held by <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>. The total cost of the buyout, including financing charges, could reach $ 9.45 billion, according to documents filed with the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> by pilots and management.

 Stock prices reached record highs for the second straight session Wednesday, riding the latest wave of the powerful advance that began almost a year ago. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials climbed 16.53 to 2,771.09, stretching its gain since the start of the week to 78.27 points. Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 5 to 4 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed stocks, with 831 up, 656 down and 506 unchanged. Volume on the floor of the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 194.59 million shares, up from 182.55 million in the previous session. Nationwide, consolidated volume in NYSE-listed issues, including trades in those stocks on regional exchanges and in the over-the-counter market, totaled 231.99 million shares. Analysts noted some `` catch-up'' buying by investors who were caught off guard by the market's rerurgent rally this week. The new advance in stock prices was attributed in large measure to persistent strength in the dollar and declining interest rates. Talk began stirring in the financial world early this week that the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> might soon find room to relax its credit policy further, prompted by slow-to-moderate economic growth and favorable inflation news. Interest rates levelled off in the credit markets Wednesday. But after hesitating for the first two hours of the session, stocks began forging ahead again. Since last Nov. 16, when the Dow Jones industrials settled back to 2,038.58, the average has soared 732.51 points, or 35.93 percent. <ORGANIZATION> USX </ORGANIZATION>, the day's most active issue, made a big contribution to the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION>'s gain with a 2 -LCB- rise to 38 -RCB-. Financier <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>, who owns about 11 percent of the company, was widely rumored to be increasing his stake in a move to enhance the return on his investment. <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION> gained 2 \ to 108 \, rebounding from a recent slide that greeted disappointing earnings news from the Elsewhere among the blue chips, <ORGANIZATION> Eastman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> rose 1 to 48 -RCB-; <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- to 58 ~; <ORGANIZATION> Procter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Gamble </ORGANIZATION> 1 -LRB- to 125 -RCB-, and <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technologies </ORGANIZATION> \ to 56 -RCB- But McDonald's, faced with heightened price competition in the fast-food business, dropped -LCB- to 30. <ORGANIZATION> Microsoft </ORGANIZATION> climbed 6 -LCB- to 75 -LCB- in the over-the-counter market. The company said it expects to report a 34 percent revenue increase for its fiscal first quarter, ended Sept. 30. As measured by <ORGANIZATION> Wilshire </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>' index of more than 5,000 actively traded stocks, the market increased $ 19.11 billion, or 0.55 percent, in value. The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>'s composite index of all its listed common stocks gained 1.14 to 197.98. <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's industrial index rose 2.60 to 407.04, and <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; P's 500-stock composite index was up 2.23 at 356.94.

 Two former researchers at a <ORGANIZATION> Johnson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> subsidiary have charged the company withheld vital information about a painkiller that was linked to severe reactions and at least nine deaths before it was pulled from the market in 1983. In a lawsuit filed in state <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brunswick </LOCATION>, the former <ORGANIZATION> McNeil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pharmaceutical </ORGANIZATION> division researchers allege <ORGANIZATION> Johnson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> engaged in `` a corporate conspiracy to get drugs on the market even if they were medically inadequate'' and to `` maximize sales of the same regardless of consequences.'' Dr. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Lemanowicz </PERSON>, <PERSON> McNeil </PERSON>'s former assistant director of regulatory affairs, and Dr. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Dale </PERSON>, former assistant director of medical research, also contend they were forced out of <PERSON> McNeil </PERSON> for refusing to take part in the alleged coverup. <ORGANIZATION> Zomax </ORGANIZATION>, a prescription painkiller developed in the 1970s, was pulled from the market in March 1983 after more than 2,000 reports of violent reactions and at least nine deaths. <ORGANIZATION> Johnson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON>, based in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brunswick </LOCATION>, issued a one-page statement Wednesday that refuted the accusations. `` Zomax was voluntarily withdrawn from the market in 1983 because of an increase in reports of allergic reactions,'' it said. `` There is no basis for their charge that <ORGANIZATION> Johnson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> McNeil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pharmaceutical </ORGANIZATION> falsified or delayed reporting any data about <ORGANIZATION> Zomax </ORGANIZATION> or any other drug,'' the statement said. `` Both of these former employees were treated with respect and consideration by <PERSON> McNeil </PERSON> and neither was asked to say or do anything inconsistent with the highest professional standards.'' <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Kanner </PERSON>, an attorney representing the researchers, said his clients sued because practices that allowed <ORGANIZATION> Zomax </ORGANIZATION> to be approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Food </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> and mass marketed despite potentially deadly side effects were never reformed. `` This is not a suit solely about <ORGANIZATION> Zomax </ORGANIZATION>,'' he said. `` This goes to the nature of what a corporation does. The reality is that the people who get promoted there are the people who care more about the result of sales than protecting the public's health.'' <PERSON> Kanner </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dale </PERSON>, a physician who objected several times during the drug's development and the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION> approval process, was concerned that testing was insufficient, that evidence of possible long-term kidney damage was discounted by the company and that warning labels for prescribing doctors were insufficient. Once on the market, the suit alleges, <PERSON> McNeil </PERSON> mishandled and understated telephone reports of adverse reactions that were made to the drug maker. <PERSON> Kanner </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> took several calls about patients who reportedly died after taking <ORGANIZATION> Zomax </ORGANIZATION>. He said <PERSON> Dale </PERSON>'s superiors at <ORGANIZATION> Johnson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> rewrote the reports to hide the severity of the reported reactions and then destroyed <PERSON> Dale </PERSON>'s source notes. The reports were then sent to the <ORGANIZATION> FDA </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Kanner </PERSON> said neither of his clients was fired but instead `` were sent into a kind of corporate <LOCATION> Siberia </LOCATION>.'' He said the doctors were seeking compensation for lost wages, lost tenure and possible punitive damages.
