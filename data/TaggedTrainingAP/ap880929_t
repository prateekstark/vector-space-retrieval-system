 Police shot and captured an armed hijacker who wanted to crash a <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737 with more than 100 people aboard into a government building in the Brazilian capital Thursday, officials said. The airliner hijacking left one person dead and four wounded in the central <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Goiania </LOCATION>, 850 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Janeiro </LOCATION> and 150 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Brasilia </LOCATION>, the capital. The gunman was shot as he left the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737 and tried to board a small getaway plane with a hostage after the rest of the passengers and crew of <ORGANIZATION> VASP </ORGANIZATION> Flight 375 were released unharmed, officials said. Authorities said the hijacker shot and killed the airliner's co-pilot and wounded three other crew members They described the hijacker as mentally disturbed. Federal Police Chief <PERSON> Romeu </PERSON> <PERSON> Tuma </PERSON> told reporters in <LOCATION> Goiania </LOCATION> that the hijacker received several bullet wounds throughout his body and was in critical condition. <PERSON> Tuma </PERSON> identified the hijacker as <PERSON> Raimundo </PERSON> <PERSON> Conceicao </PERSON>, 28. Airport officials said no Americans were aboard. The police chief said <PERSON> Conceicao </PERSON> told the control tower at <LOCATION> Goiania </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Genoveva </LOCATION> airport that he wanted to `` slam the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 737 into a ministry building in <LOCATION> Brasilia </LOCATION>'' but later agreed to take a smaller plane. Holding a .38 - caliber revolver and taking the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>'s pilot with him, the hijacker descended from the jet parked on the runway at the A small Brazilian-made Bandeirantes plane was to take him and the pilot to <LOCATION> Brasilia </LOCATION>, said air force spokesman Col. <PERSON> Eden </PERSON> <PERSON> Avolinsque </PERSON>. The hijacker had demanded to talk to President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON> about the country's economic policies, which he thought were wrong, said <LOCATION> Goiania </LOCATION> police spokesman <PERSON> Morton </PERSON> <PERSON> Luiz </PERSON>. `` Police shot at him as he left the plane and he turned around and shot the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> pilot, whom he had taken as his only hostage,'' Avolinsque told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Brasilia </LOCATION>. `` He ran off into the bushes, and police following close behind shot ... him.'' Pilot <PERSON> Fernando </PERSON> <PERSON> Murillo </PERSON> <PERSON> Silva </PERSON> was shot in the leg, <PERSON> Avolinsque </PERSON> said. `` We had orders from the president not to negotiate with the hijacker and not to refuel the plane,'' Avolinsque said. Hundreds of heavily armed federal and state police and uniformed army troops had surrounded the jet, isolated at the end of a runway. <ORGANIZATION> VASP </ORGANIZATION>, a domestic carrier, is a <LOCATION> Portuguese </LOCATION> acronym for <ORGANIZATION> Viacao </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aerea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sao </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paulo </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> VASP </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Mona </PERSON> <PERSON> Cury </PERSON> said Flight 375 was on its daily run from the <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> jungle city of <LOCATION> Porto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Velho </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> on the southeast <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> coast when it was hijacked. The hijacker ordered the airliner be flown to <LOCATION> Brasilia </LOCATION> but the government refused to let it land, said <PERSON> Luiz </PERSON>. After nearly running out of fuel, the jet landed in <LOCATION> Goiania </LOCATION>, `` He told the control tower he was against the economic policies of President <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Sarney </PERSON> and insisted on going to <LOCATION> Brasilia </LOCATION>. He did n't make any other demands,'' <PERSON> Luiz </PERSON> said by telephone from <LOCATION> Goiania </LOCATION>. Earlier, <ORGANIZATION> VASP </ORGANIZATION> and the Rio airport authority had reported a passenger also was killed, but later denied the information. <PERSON> Tuma </PERSON> flew from <LOCATION> Brasilia </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Goiania </LOCATION> to direct negotiations with the hijacker. He said the man `` showed signs of mental disturbance.'' <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferrini </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> VASP </ORGANIZATION> employee at the <LOCATION> Goiania </LOCATION> airport, said soldiers were taken to an identical plane to study it for a possible invasion. Live TV reports from <LOCATION> Goiania </LOCATION> showed soldiers with rifles creeping up to the plane and then running away. <PERSON> Avolinsque </PERSON> said the hijacker boarded the plane during a refueling stop in <PERSON> Belo </PERSON> <PERSON> Horizonte </PERSON>, 290 miles north of <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION>. `` About 20 minutes after takeoff, he got up and walked toward the cockpit. A steward said, ` That's not the toilet,' and the man turned and shot him, injuring him in the head,'' Avolinsque said at a news conference in the air force ministry. <PERSON> Avolinsque </PERSON> said the hijacker entered the cockpit, shot co-pilot <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON> <PERSON> Evangelista </PERSON> in the head and a flight engineer in the leg and ordered the pilot to fly to <LOCATION> Brasilia </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> VASP </ORGANIZATION> said the plane carried 98 passengers and seven crew members. When the plane landed in <LOCATION> Goiania </LOCATION> in the early afternoon, the hijacker permitted the injured crew members and another steward to be taken from the plane. <PERSON> Evangelista </PERSON> later died, <PERSON> Luiz </PERSON> and air control officials said.

<HEAD>Bradley Unveils Plan to Cut Truck Traffic</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Mayor <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> on Wednesday proposed a plan intended to cut the number of trucks traveling on highways leading into the nation's second-largest city during peak traffic hours. <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>'s plan, which will be submitted to the <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> for approval, is intended to keep 70 percent of heavy-duty truck fleets that normally operate during peak trafic hours off the road. <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> was joined by rerpesentatives of the area's trucking industry as he announced the plan. He said he did not blame truckers for <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>' traffic woes. But he said it was their turn to help alleviate the traffic congestion that afflicts the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> area. `` No one doubts that truck shipments are vital to our economy,'' <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> said. `` The old saying ` If you got it, a truck brought it,' still largely applies. But there is no reason so many truck deliveries must be made during these peak rush-hour travel times,'' <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> said. The mayor's plan would allow only 30 percent of large truck fleets to operate on city roadways from 6 a.m. to 9 a.m. and from 4 p.m. to 7 p.m. The 30 percent of the trucks that fleet owners decide to operate during peak hours would have to display a city certificate that could cost up to $ 60. Stiff fines would be levied if a trucker operated without the certificate. Trucks weighing 29,000 pounds or more would be subject to certification under the <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> plan. The $ 60 certificate fee would help fund a multi-agency `` rapid deployment force'' that <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> said would quickly clear snarled surface streets and freeways of broken-down trucks and cars. The plan includes partial exemption for owner-operators of single trucks. They are allowed to use city roads either in the morning or the evening rush hour. The plan will also allow for a case-by-case exemption. City sanitation turcks and certain hazardous materials collection trucks also will be exempted under the <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> plan. Although the plan will only allow 30 percent of the large-fleet trucks that currently travel during rush-hour, analysts with the mayor's office estimate the partial exemption for owner-operators and the case-by-case examption will result in a cut of about 50 percent.

 British <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> gave an art contest, but nobody won. Jurors decided the entries just were n't good enough `` It was a difficult situation but it was n't a difficult decision,'' said <PERSON> Willard </PERSON> <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON>, director of the Vancouver Art Gallery. <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> was among the jurors who decided that none of the 380 entries deserved any of the $ 10,000 in prize money. But the show will go on. Even though prize money has not been awarded, the 20-odd finalists will be displayed at an exhibition opening Oct. 11. The contest was organized by the Federation of Canadian Artists and sponsored by <ORGANIZATION> Canadian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Products </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd </ORGANIZATION>. The theme of the competition, for which only British <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> artists were eligible, was `` water and its usefulness to industry.'' About 380 entries by 300 artists were submitted. `` We did n't see any work which we felt we could support for the prizes,'' <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> said Tuesday. `` I had reservations about taking part in this event and those reservations have been confirmed.'' He said the jurors first looked at color slides of all the entries and could n't reach a decision. They then looked at the originals of about 20 potential winners without success. <ORGANIZATION> Canada </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forest </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Armstrong </PERSON> said his company was disappointed with the jury decision but has told the artist federation to keep the prize money and use it as it sees fit.

 Hundreds of people from around the country want to buy the antiquated penny parking meters that lined the streets of this <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION> suburb for more than 30 years. But officials say the proposed sale has turned out to be a big headache. Initially, the township planned to trade in the 167 meters for new ones, but decided to sell them after being flooded with purchase requests, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schoenberg </PERSON>, the township's finance director. `` If I had any idea -LRB- about the problems -RRB- I probably would have thought twice,'' <PERSON> Schoenberg </PERSON> said Wednesday. The township council scrapped a plan last week to sell the meters for $ 100 each through a lottery-by-mail after a resident charged the proposal was unfair because it gave preferential treatment to current and former residents, taxpayers and business owners. The resident, <PERSON> Greg </PERSON> <PERSON> Leonberg </PERSON>, said the plan did not comply with a state statute on the disposal of municipal property. The township either must open up bidding for the meters, hold a public auction or trade them in, he said. Because of the controversy, <PERSON> Schoenberg </PERSON> said, the township is considering holding some form of bidding or auction. More than 600 prospective buyers have indicated they want a meter, <PERSON> Schoenberg </PERSON> said. In August, the community of 16,000 residents replaced the old-fashioned meters with nickel meters. The old meters, which dated from the 1950s, took a penny for 12 minutes of parking. But replacement parts became hard to find. <PERSON> Leonberg </PERSON> said he is even considering buying a meter, although he said `` they have no value at all.''

 For most people, house-hunting is no easy task. For <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Asher </PERSON> and her 35 felines, it's become a catastrophe. <PERSON> Asher </PERSON> thought she had found an ideal home a year ago when she moved into a seven-room house with a big yard in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Braddock </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION> suburb with no law restricting pets. <PERSON> Asher </PERSON> said she told neighbors about the cats before she bought the house and was told they would not be a problem. `` Maybe they really did n't believe me when I said I had 35 cats,'' she said. In July, District Justice <PERSON> Betty </PERSON> <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> found <PERSON> Asher </PERSON> guilty of harassment after neighbors claimed the cats damaged their lawn furniture and left paw prints on their cars. <PERSON> Asher </PERSON> has appealed to Common Pleas Court. <PERSON> Asher </PERSON> concedes the cats wandered outside her yard despite a new $ 3,800 fence that surrounds the home and is topped with an overhang that slants inward. Neighbors have pressed for passage of a local pet ordinance, and Council President <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Holt </PERSON> said the town's solicitor is drawing up a measure. Frustrated over continuing problems, <PERSON> Asher </PERSON>, 47, an employment training and placement specialist for the state, has put her house up for sale. `` I've made a lot of sacrifices to keep my little family together,'' said <PERSON> Asher </PERSON>, who also was evicted from an apartment in <LOCATION> Braddock </LOCATION> because of the cats.

 She may be a hit in her homeland, but Miss <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> is strictly a miss in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, a victim of chilly relations between nations. `` Yankee Administration Behaves Worse Than A Fool. They Deny Visa to the <PERSON> Belle </PERSON>,'' screamed a headline Wednesday in the pro-government newspaper <ORGANIZATION> El </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nuevo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Diario </ORGANIZATION>. The newspaper said the reigning Miss <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, 19-year-old <PERSON> Gabriela </PERSON> <PERSON> Robleto </PERSON> <PERSON> Barquero </PERSON>, was denied a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> visa this week to enter <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> for an international beauty contest. But a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy official in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> said not even beauty queens can thaw the icy relations between <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, which has since 1981 backed the rebels known as Contras who are seeking to overthrow this country's leftist Sandinista government. `` She is just one of thousands of Nicaraguans to whom we've been unable to provide visa services because of the actions of the Nicaraguan government,'' said the diplomat, speaking in a telephone interview on condition of anonymity. `` The Nicaraguan refusal to issue visas to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomatic personnel prevents us from replacing our diplomats,'' he said. `` The embassy can not function in a normal manner when Nicaraguan actions are keeping us severely understaffed.'' The embassy stopped issuing visas to Nicaraguans in July, shortly after <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> expelled <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Melton </PERSON> and seven diplomats, accusing them of trying to undermine the government. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> responded by expelling <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s ambassador and other diplomats The <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> official said Wednesday that the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> had in July requested official visas to replace the eight ousted American diplomats. He said those requests were not processed. American tourists do not need visas to enter <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. Miss <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> is not the most prominent victim of the visa war, however.

 Tired of teen-agers driving dangerously fast, Judge <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> came up with an `` educational punishment'' that officials say may save lives by making the youths think twice. Youngsters convicted of going 80 mph or more in <LOCATION> Macon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> are ordered to spend a day with high-speed accident victims, many unable to move more than their eyeballs in the hospital beds where they live out their lives. `` I've been on too many phone calls from the highway patrol saying that some youngster was killed in a car wreck. I'm sick of that,'' said <PERSON> Foley </PERSON>, a county prosecutor for 23 years before becoming an associate circuit judge 1 -LCB- years ago. He is 53. `` I'm trying to reach youthful drivers who have 50 years ahead of them. You expect kids to make mistakes, but if you let them do nothing about it but mail in a fine, then what have you done to modify their behavior?'' <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> has sent about 30 speeders aged 16-21 to the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Missouri </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sciences </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> for a day of talking to doctors, nurses and other staff members along with some of the patients. The youngsters then have to write an essay about what they learned. If they fail to go to the hospital and write the essay, they risk losing their licenses. The hospital trip does not keep them from having to pay fines of $ 150 - $ 200 `` I really chew on these kids so they'll know what they did,'' <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> said. Nobody making the trip to <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> has reappeared before him for speeding, the judge said, although one youth was later ticketed in another county. In one essay, a 17-year-old boy who had been caught going 94 mph summed up the effect of touring the intensive care unit, where tubes and wires keep patients alive: `` This scene was more disgusting than watching all of the Friday the 13th movies consecutively.'' He added, `` Although everyone makes mistakes, not everyone gets by as easily as I did. Some people will pay for their high-speed driving for the rest of their lives.'' Another speeder wrote that he gave up his motorcycle: `` I have lost my nerve and do n't want to have my luck run out. I want to live a long life.'' At the hospital, the teen-agers get a picture of what happens from the time a patient is admitted, through treatment and rehabilitation, said <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Cain </PERSON>, who runs the program and is coordinator of the hospital's head and spinal injury prevention project. `` They expect to see blood and guts and be frightened,'' she said. `` The real reality for them is seeing somebody trying to learn to eat or learn to speak. They see people doing things as basic as learning how to comb their hair.'' For the most part the patients are the same age as the speeders, which Ms. <PERSON> Cain </PERSON> said has a profound impact on them. `` The day slowly grows on them. They do n't come in and immediately see something that'll knock their socks off,'' she said. `` As the day goes on, they get quieter.'' One turning point in their feelings, she said, is having lunch with a 21-year-old quadriplegic. `` It makes a real impact on them. He's pretty blunt with telling them what his life is like.'' Ms. <PERSON> Cain </PERSON> and <PERSON> Foley </PERSON> said it is too early to assess the program's impact on the speeders but both believe it is paying benefits `` At least we can see where we get their attention and they learn something,'' she said.

 A university research center here has started to unlock the secrets of the centuries-old Chinese tradition of using herbs, deer antlers, dried seahorses and other exotica as medicines. Some scientists believe the medicines could help improve modern health care. Chinese medicine also has long been popular in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and sales have boomed in recent years. `` Sales of herbs have gone up because they have preventative functions and do not have side effects,'' said <PERSON> Lau </PERSON> <PERSON> Pun </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheung </PERSON>, president of the 600-member <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Merchants </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicinal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Material </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> at the <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hong </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kong </ORGANIZATION> was set up 12 years ago to investigate the traditional prescriptions and disseminate its findings. The program involves compiling an exhaustive English-language database on Chinese medicine and conducting experiments with traditional prescriptions to determine their efficacy. `` We wish to open up this treasure house of information to worldwide research,'' director <PERSON> Chang </PERSON> <PERSON> Hson-mou </PERSON> explained of the center's computer system that stores botanical, chemical, pharmacological and clinical reports of common Chinese herbs. The data is constantly updated with information from about 180 journals from <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, he said. <PERSON> Chang </PERSON> acknowledged that some Communist Chinese authorities originally resisted the program, claiming that giving foreign researchers access to information about traditional medicine was similar to giving away state secrets. They later backed down, <PERSON> Chang </PERSON> said, and the center now stores more than 700 items used in Chinese medicine, including herbs, ginseng -LRB- the white root of a carrot-like plant -RRB-, shells, insects, frog secretion, deer tails and minerals such as sulphur and gypsum. Scientists at the center are analyzing selected prescriptions made of such material in search of active ingredients that could provide clues to developing new drugs. <PERSON> Chang </PERSON> said researchers recently analyzed a series of popular formulas known as `` anshen zhenjing,'' or tranquilizers, and discovered an active ingredient with effects similar to the popular Western drug Valium. `` Although these herbs have been used for generations, the active component ... had not been uncovered,'' he said. The center's scientists have learned how to synthesize the compound, which has attracted the interest of five pharmaceutical companies. The center also is using modern detectors to examine herbs used by Chinese hospitals for treatment of serious heart conditions such as acute myocardial infarction _ the blocking of the heart vessel. `` This is not a placebo,'' <PERSON> Chang </PERSON> said of the prescription. `` The result seems to be quite good.'' Another project involves basic research into the use of Chinese medicine to reinforce the body's immune system. `` This is a hot topic because of AIDS,'' <PERSON> Chang </PERSON> said, but he cautioned that the center is not trying to develop a wonder drug to cure that fatal disease. `` The Chinese immunology approach is to go slow, to recover your natural balance,'' he said. The experiments are designed to separate the useless from useful in Chinese medicine, <PERSON> Chang </PERSON> said. He expressed skepticisim, for example, that any of the hundreds of traditional Chinese prescriptions for hepatitis can be effective. `` We have analyzed only a few, but I am doubtful,'' he said. <PERSON> Chang </PERSON> said well over half the respondents to a 1983 university survey said they used traditional medicine or acupuncture to supplement Western medicine. <PERSON> Maurice </PERSON> <PERSON> Chung </PERSON>, general manager of Bristol-Myers -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> HK </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> -RRB- </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, said the U.S.-based international pharmaceutical company is keeping an eye on the center's research. `` It could develop new leads,'' he said. `` It's new ground, a new field.'' Other programs in <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> also are bringing traditional Chinese medicine into the computer age. For example, the research institute of the local <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Practitioners </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> has developed a system in which a patient's symptoms are entered into a computer program that then determined what traditional prescription would be best. The program is used primarily by junior practitioners to help them learn the art of diagnosis, said <PERSON> Chan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ying-chee </PERSON>, president of the institute.

<HEAD>Several Factors In Korean Clampdown As Games Near Their End</HEAD>

<DATELINE>SEOUL, South Korea (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The South Koreans, world-class friskers and scanners, are drawing their tight security net even tighter around the Olympics as the sports spectacular heads toward its final days. <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>'s tough-talking student radicals are threatening to disrupt Sunday's marathon. A <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> security specialist says his biggest worry is the anti-Americanism surfacing among ordinary <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Koreans </LOCATION>. One Korean official finds the real security threat coming from the athletes themselves _ one might defect and put the Olympic hosts in an awkward position. After 12 days of Games, the security concerns at <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> are often in the eye of the beholder. But by Wednesday everyone could see the new Olympics-wide clampdown. For the first time, for example, police bomb-sniffing dogs were deployed at the Olympic weightlifting hall. At the Olympic press center, the security men blocked driveways with more steel barriers, checked car trunks and undercarriages for bombs, and closely searched visitors and journalists. `` We increased the vigil,'' one Olympic security official said. The tightening up coincided with Tuesday's announcement that an anti-government student leader jailed since last week had been formally charged under the tough <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION>, which covers sedition and similar acts. Oh Young-sik's followers have threatened to disrupt Olympic events, including Sunday's men's marathon, a 26-mile run through the heart of <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, unless he is freed. The marathon, vulnerable because of its length and route, is expected to be well-guarded by police strung out along the boulevards and by commandos trailing along in armored vehicles. But some questioned whether <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>'s militant students were the main target of the stepped-up security, since the students favor symbolic street clashes with police, rather than car bombs or other terror blows against innocent civilians. Had authorities detected a sudden threat from international terrorists, such as the shadowy, ultra-leftist <ORGANIZATION> Japanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>? `` Categorically, no,'' said an <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> official who works closely with the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> security authorities. This informant, who like most security officials here spoke on condition of anonymity, suggested that the Koreans reinforced their security apparatus simply because it had grown more lax since opening day, Sept. 17. `` They had let their socks down a little bit,'' he said. Of the Korean protective net, involving more than 100,000 security personnel, the American said: `` It's working. And not only have there been no big plots, there have not even been attempted plots. ... `` We're more concerned now about the mood swings of the <LOCATION> Korean </LOCATION> people, the anti-Americanism.'' <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> newspapers have been flooded with letters and calls from ordinary Koreans angry over the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> athletes' unruly, `` arrogant'' behavior during the opening ceremony, Americans' boisterous cheering at sports events, the `` biased'' reporting by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> news media of an Olympic boxing incident in which Korean officials attacked a referee, and the theft of an expensive bar ornament by two <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> swimmers. On Tuesday night, another American got in trouble. Runner <PERSON> Johnny </PERSON> <PERSON> Gray </PERSON> was arrested after he kicked a taxi door in a dispute with the driver. He was later released. Meanwhile, down at the Olympic Village, where the athletes reside, village Director-General <PERSON> Ryu </PERSON> <PERSON> Keun-ha </PERSON> has other things on his mind. He told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Korea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> that his security people would thoroughly check names of departing athletes against official lists to ensure that none tries to defect. `` We will pay our utmost attention to prevent any undesirable incidents,'' he was quoted as saying. In an unusual move, the <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> government, eager to establish relations with <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> bloc countries, has announced it will not grant political asylum to any athletes who seek to defect.

<HEAD>State Supreme Court Censures Judge For Remarks To Woman Later

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The state's highest court censured a district court judge Wednesday for `` discourtesy, rudeness and sarcasm'' to a woman involved in a domestic dispute case who later was slain by her husband. The state Supreme Judicial court recommended private censure for <ORGANIZATION> Somerville </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Heffernan </PERSON> for his courtroom treatment of <PERSON> Pamela </PERSON> <PERSON> Nigro </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON>, who was murdered by her husband, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>, in August 1986. Private censure involves no fine, penalty or loss of judicial power. The case stemmed from charges by <PERSON> Mrs. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON>'s family that <PERSON> Heffernan </PERSON> humiliated and belittled her in court hearings. The high court dismissed allegations of a pattern of such conduct by <PERSON> Heffernan </PERSON>, noting that he granted Mrs. <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON>'s request for court protection from her husband. It said no connection existed between <PERSON> Heffernan </PERSON>'s courtroom demeanor and her murder. <PERSON> Heffernan </PERSON>, 55, of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, did not return phone calls seeking comment. His attorney, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Dwyer </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> said the judge accepts the <ORGANIZATION> SJC </ORGANIZATION> ruling. <PERSON> Carole </PERSON> <PERSON> Nigro </PERSON>, Mrs. <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON>'s mother, called the ruling too lenient. `` I'm not saying he was the cause of her murder, but just the way he handles women in court is wrong.'' A central incident in the case stemmed from a March 14, 1986, hearing before <PERSON> Heffernan </PERSON> in which Mrs. <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON>, who had been beaten by her husband, sought permission to return to retrieve her clothes from her husband's house. At that hearing, <PERSON> Heffernan </PERSON> interrupted Mrs. <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON> and said, `` I do n't think it's the role of this court to decide down to each and every piece of underwear who owns what. As a matter of fact, I find it a little ridiculous to be involved in it.'' At a March 26, 1986, hearing with both husband and wife present, <PERSON> Heffernan </PERSON> told <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON>, `` Let's get this matter resolved. O.K.? You want to gnaw on her or she on you, fine, but let's not do it at the taxpayers' expense.'' Five months after that hearing, <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON> murdered his wife and disposed of her body at a town dump. He has been convicted of first-degree murder. <PERSON> Heffernan </PERSON> `` was rude and sarcastic during portions of the <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON> proceeding. A single listening to the tape recording of those hearings establishes those facts,'' the justices said in their 11-page ruling. The decision noted that <PERSON> Heffernan </PERSON>'s `` loud, deep voice -LRB- and -RRB- physically imposing manner,'' contributed to the intimidation of Mrs. <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON>. The court said it was `` troubling for the future,'' that <PERSON> Heffernan </PERSON> refused in testimony before the state <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judicial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Conduct </ORGANIZATION> to admit his demeanor was intimidating. <PERSON> Dwyer </PERSON>, <PERSON> Heffernan </PERSON>'s attorney, said <PERSON> Heffernan </PERSON> had voluntarily withdrawn from domestic dispute cases and had no mmediate plans to resume hearing them. And he said <PERSON> Heffernan </PERSON> has tried to tone down the resonance of his voice in court.

<HEAD>Report Recommends Massive Changes in Medicaid Payments to Doctors</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY ESTILL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Family physicians are grossly underpaid relative to surgeons and other high-priced specialists, says a long-awaited report laying the groundwork for potentially massive changes in the way medicine is practiced in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Ordered up by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> three years ago, the 2,000-page survey released Wednesday is certain to spark sharp debate in the medical profession and beyond. If the study recommendations were applied immediately, heart surgeons would suffer a 45 percent reduction in their <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> fees and general practitioners would receive a 65 percent raise. But because of the complex and emotionally loaded issues surrounding any discussion of health care _ not to mention the competition for dollars and cents _ no one is predicting an early and literal application. That is not to say the preliminary skirmishing will not begin immediately and be intense. Dr. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Roper </PERSON>, head of the federal agency that pays the medical bills for more than 31 million elderly and disabled Americans on Medicare, held out the prospect Wednesday that there are some things a budget-conscious <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> `` might want to do in 1989 before the mega-debate'' is completed. For example, he said, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> might use the study as a rationale for trimming some Medicare-approved payments from the top end of the scale without adding much or anything at the bottom end. `` Nobody is going to get 65 percent more from Medicare next year, for example,'' he said. Even the father of the $ 2.3 million study told reporters it would not be practical to implement its recommendations at once. <ORGANIZATION> Harvard </ORGANIZATION> medical economist <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hsiao </PERSON> said a five-year phase in period might be needed. <PERSON> Hsiao </PERSON>'s study pointedly does not say any category of physician is overpaid or underpaid in actual dollars and cents _ but rather that the way they divide the financial pie is unfair and potentially detrimental to sound medical treatment. Officially, it is entitled `` A National Study of Resource-based <ORGANIZATION> Relative </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Value </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Scales </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> For </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Physicians </ORGANIZATION>' Services.'' In simplest terms, what <PERSON> Hsiao </PERSON>'s work suggests is that if a physician faces the option of performing surgery or using an equally promising but less financially rewarding treatment, the present fee system encourages surgery. His proposal would attempt to change that. `` You can predict that under the new system, doctors will be willing to spend a lot more time with patients to examine and counsel them,'' <PERSON> Hsiao </PERSON> said. `` Right now, physicians are being penalized financially for spending time with patients.'' Moreover, he said, the changes could encourage more young doctors to go into primary patient care and lower the overall cost of medical treatment. <PERSON> Roper </PERSON>, who heads the <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Care </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Financing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, hailed <PERSON> Hsiao </PERSON>'s work although he expressed reservations about whether it should serve as the basis for a wholesale revision of Medicare pay scales. <PERSON> Roper </PERSON>'s agency contracted for the $ 2.3 million study. He said it provides a scientific basis for `` what medical observers have known for some time.'' He cautioned that the new system advocated in the report would not necessarily constrain overall medical costs _ which are rising far faster than any other segment of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> economy _ and `` could worsen the ... problem if the resulting income redistributions encourage those physicians who face fee reductions to increase the volume or intensity of services.'' Even though the impact of the report is likely to take years to percolate throughout the health care system, the attention it is generating within the profession is intense. The Journal of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> is devoting its entire next issue to the subject, and the <ORGANIZATION> AMA </ORGANIZATION>'s house of delegates will vote in December on whether to endorse <PERSON> Hsiao </PERSON>'s plan. While the study originated with a <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> struggling to get a handle on skyrocketing <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> costs, it also could affect the way private insurers determine how much they will pay for particular services. And although doctors technically are not limited in how much they charge by how much public or private insurance will pay, their insured patients _ their customers _ become acutely aware of the cost of medical care when they have to pay part of the bill out of their own pockets. The first summaries of <PERSON> Hsiao </PERSON>'s work, along with an editorial commentary by <PERSON> Roper </PERSON>, appeared in The <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> England </LOCATION> of Journal of Medicine at the same time the study was formally delivered to <ORGANIZATION> HCFA </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Hsiao </PERSON> tried to determine how much work is involved in 2,000 duties performed by doctors in 14 specialties. He and colleagues took into consideration malpractice insurance premiums and other costs, specialty training, time, mental effort, technical skill, physical effort and psychological stress. For each task, he came up with a non-monetary value. For instance, a comprehensive visit by a new patient to a family practitioner is 248, while a well-baby visit is 64. An appendectomy is 621, a pacemaker insertion is 620, and a triple coronary bypass is 2,871. To figure out how much doctors will get, these values would be multiplied by a monetary conversion figure. If the figure were $ 1, for example, a well-baby visit would be worth $ 64 and an appendectomy $ 621.

 This season the Metropolitan Opera will stage all four operas in <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON>'s Ring Cycle and on Wednesday, the third night of the season, it presented the first one, `` Das Rheingold.'' Casting was carefully done. As the Met chose singers who knew the Handel style for its second-night `` <PERSON> Guilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Cesare </PERSON>,'' the singers in `` Das Rheingold'' knew the <PERSON> Wagner </PERSON> style. Two were making very fine debuts. <PERSON> Hanna </PERSON> <PERSON> Schwarz </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Hamburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, sang <LOCATION> Fricka </LOCATION>, wife of <PERSON> Wotan </PERSON>, leader of the gods. The mezzo-soprano, who has sung at <LOCATION> Bayreuth </LOCATION> since 1975, has the needed volume and has her vibrato under control. Through much of the opera she is concerned about her sister <PERSON> Freia </PERSON> and her voice always sounded sympathetic, with a sweet overtone. <PERSON> Wotan </PERSON>, sung by <PERSON> Hans </PERSON> <PERSON> Sotin </PERSON>, has a dark voice that sounds full of compassion, even when he's laying down the law.

<HEAD>WASHINGTON TODAY: Bush Savings Plan Fails to Impress Many Analysts</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposed tax break for saving does n't amount to much of a benefit, according to most analysts, although one <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> economist says it could be an incentive for new parents to set aside money for a child's college education. Under the right conditions, says <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Makin </PERSON> of the conservative <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION>, after 20 years a savings account at withdrawal using the vice president's proposal would have earned 22.5 percent more than under current law. But that assumes an account could earn 10 percent a year _ which it generally would not now _ and that the family was in the 28 percent tax bracket, which would cut out a large number of families that the proposal is designed to help. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Minarik </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> used a different calculation and reached a decidedly less upbeat conclusion. `` I do n't think it is a good idea. The benefit to the saver is quite small,'' he said. In addition, <PERSON> Minarik </PERSON> said, `` any benefit to the saver comes dollar for dollar from the federal treasury.'' And because the government is spending more than it takes in, enactment of the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> proposal would mean `` the government is borrowing so the individual can save. Some might suggest that's not necessarily a wise thing for the government to do.'' <PERSON> Makin </PERSON> acknowledges that `` it's going to look a lot less attractive if you are talking five years -LRB- of contributions rather than 20 -RRB- and a 15 percent tax bracket'' rather than 28 percent. `` It's better than nothing, but it's not going to change the world dramatically,'' he says. According to <PERSON> Makin </PERSON>'s calculation, a couple in the 28 percent bracket fortunate enough to deposit $ 1,000 a year for 20 years and earn 10 percent could withdraw $ 57,275 and, after subtracting the $ 20,000 principal and paying tax, be left with $ 26,838. Without the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> incentive, the money would have earned $ 4,936 less, or $ 21,902. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> offered the broad outlines of his proposal while campaigning Tuesday in <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>. He billed the plan as an incentive for low - and middle-income Americans to save more and, thus, foster economic growth Under the proposal, a taxpayer could set aside up to $ 1,000 a year in an account, leave it intact for at least five years, and earnings on the money would be tax-free until withdrawn. The full $ 1,000 a year would be available only to people with adjusted gross incomes of $ 50,000 or less. The benefit would decline as income rises above that figure and disappear when income tops $ 60,000. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> proposal should not be confused with Individual Retirement Accounts. Since the 1986 tax overhaul any worker not covered by a company pension may contribute up to $ 2,000 a year to an <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> and pay no tax on the contribution or its interest until withdrawn. Workers who have a company pension and make less than $ 50,000 may qualify for some deduction. But the big difference between IRAs and the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> plan is the deduction. Most workers may fully deduct their <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> contribution; no one could deduct the annual contribution under the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> proposal. The only tax benefit would be deferral of taxes on interest earned by the annual contributions. <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Heritage </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION> has not analyzed the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> proposal but said that generally conservative organization supports encouraging increased saving through tax incentives rather than by raising taxes. Some in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> are suggesting a federal sales tax to encourage saving; they reason that since the tax would apply only to money that is spent, most people with a choice would choose to save. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> McIntyre </PERSON>, director of Citizens for <ORGANIZATION> Tax </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION>, a liberal research organization, views the vice president's proposal as a way to undo the tax overhaul enacted in 1986. `` This is just another move to turn it around,'' he said. <PERSON> McIntyre </PERSON> calculated that the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> plan would be worth an extra $ 471 to a couple in the 28 percent bracket whose $ 1,000 contribution earned 10 percent a year for 10 years. `` What's the point?'' he asked. He said the far more valuable IRAs are used by only 8 percent of people at the $ 30,000 income level. `` Nobody uses them because they do n't have the money, and they would n't have the money for the less attractive'' accounts that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> proposed, <PERSON> McIntyre </PERSON> said.

<TEXT>
 If animal scientists have their way, <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> consumers some day may be eating bacon that has its roots in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> says a `` historic agreement to import Chinese breeding swine'' has been reached and that the pact may help upgrade the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> pork industry. Deputy Secretary <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Myers </PERSON> said Wednesday the contract involves <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s ministry of agriculture, and the <ORGANIZATION> Chinese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Animal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Breeding </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Import </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Export </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp </ORGANIZATION>. The imports will include 144 pigs of the <LOCATION> Meishan </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Ming </PERSON> and Fengjing breeds, he said. The animals will be used in research studies under a cooperative agreement with the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s meat animal research laboratory at Clay Center, <LOCATION> Neb. </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION>, and <ORGANIZATION> Iowa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. No other details of the agreement were announced, but a department spokesman, <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Greene </PERSON>, said the financing arrangements were handled by the two universities. <PERSON> Myers </PERSON>, a hog farmer from <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, said <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has about 100 breeds of swine that represent a `` unique reservoir of unexplored germplasm'' that could offer potential benefits for the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> industry. Germplasm is semen and other genetic material. `` This unexploited source ... could prove to be very valuable to the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> research programs on resistance to diseases, parasites and improvement of some production traits,'' he said. `` <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has a long history in the domestication of pigs that can be traced back for at least 6,000 years.'' According to <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> reports, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> also is the world's largest hog producer. At the end of 1983, for example, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> had an inventory of 298.5 million hogs, compared with 55.8 million for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> at that time. A goal of the import program is to cross the Chinese breeds with <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> breeds to increase litter size, and at the same time maintain the quality and lean yield of pork. The breeds being imported have three to four more pigs per litter than the average <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> breed. The animals will be imported in late March 1989 after spending 60 days in quarantine in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and meeting other health requirements. They will be quarantined again for 120 days at <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s animal import center in <LOCATION> Fleming </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Key </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, before being released for research <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerrits </PERSON> of the department's <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> said scientists hope to conduct at least five years of research to evaluate the animals and determine if they should be released for use by the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> swine industry. <PERSON> Gerrits </PERSON> said that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> swine geneticists recognized the potential value of Chinese swine more than 10 years ago, but `` satisfactory health and quarantine requirements were not completed'' until last year. `` The three breeds selected for the research studies are highly prolific,'' he said. `` <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> geneticists estimate it would take at least 30 generations of conventional selection to increase the litter size of the average <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> swine breed to the level routinely produced by these Chinese breeds.''

 The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> says it has resumed research into the growing and use of kenaf, a fibrous plant that can be used to make paper, after a decade of being on the back burner. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Waterworth </PERSON>, coordinator of kenaf research for <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION>, said Wednesday that $ 300,000 is being spent this year in kenaf studies through agency laboratories in <LOCATION> Lane </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Okla. </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Weslaco </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> Another $ 300,000 is scheduled for 1989. `` Industry trials, including test runs by several <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> newspapers, indicate that pulp from kenaf makes newsprint paper that is as sturdy as woodpulp paper but generally is brighter, consumes less ink and has less ink ruboff,'' <PERSON> Waterworth </PERSON> said. Kenaf can be grown in southern <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> states such as <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Georgia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mississippi </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, he said. The plants grow 15 to 18 feet in height in less than five months and can reach about 22 feet. An acre yields 7 to 10 tons of dry fiber. The <LOCATION> Peoria </LOCATION> -LRB- Ill. -RRB- <PERSON> Journal-Star </PERSON> in 1977 was the first newspaper to make a press run on kenaf newsprint. At least eight other newspapers have had similar tests, including the most recent in July 1987 at the <LOCATION> Bakerfield </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Californian </LOCATION>. Agency research on kenaf was suspended in 1978 when supplies of paper pulp were plentiful and prices were down, <PERSON> Waterworth </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> has spent about $ 900,000 to support commercial development of kenaf through private industry since 1986, and the new funds for research are expected `` to give additional support'' to that enterprise, he said.

 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> has bought an additional 250,000 metric tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corn for delivery during the coming year, says the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. The sale, announced Wednesday, raised total corn sold to the Soviets in the last four weeks to more than 3.75 million tons. A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 39.4 bushels of corn. The 250,000 tons of corn would be about 9.85 million bushels. Corn prices have been averaging about $ 2.61 per bushel at the farm level, according to <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> estimates, meaning that the latest sale could have a farm value of around $ 26 million.

 <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is preparing to force the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> to combat a mounting wave of infectious medical waste washing up on the nation's shores. The latest step in the process came Wednesday when the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> gave voice-vote approval to legislation that would require creation-to-disposal controls on things such as used syringes. The action all but guaranteed that before adjourning next month <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will respond to the tides of used syringes and AIDS-contaminated materials that appeared this summer in <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Erie </LOCATION> and at beaches in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>. The bill, which backers say will be passed next week by the full <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, is similar to legislation approved in August by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. Staffers on both sides of the Capitol say they expect no problems resolving differences between the two plans. `` The illegal disposal of medical waste is spreading like an epidemic,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Luken </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, principal sponsor of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> bill. `` Much of this waste is infectious. It can literally kill people. All of it is repulsive and frightening.'' <PERSON> Luken </PERSON> said that in <LOCATION> Youngstown </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, a physician put used syringes in a trash bin. `` Kids found the needles and played ` doctor' with them, giving each other injections that could have proved fatal.'' The legislation would require <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> to set up a system to track infectious medical waste generated in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION> and the eight states bordering the Great Lakes. However, the regional demonstration program could become national in scope because any state would be allowed to opt for coverage under rules that would require a paper trail from waste generation to disposal. `` Tracking helps stop midnight dumping,'' <PERSON> Luken </PERSON> said. `` Hospitals and clinics will now know where their medical waste is going, and so will <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION>.'' The bill proposes stiff penalties: a civil fine of up to $ 25,000 for each day of violation and a maximum criminal penalty of 15 years in prison and a daily violation fine of up to $ 50,000. Committee members said <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is being forced to act because <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> had failed to issue regulations _ first proposed 10 years ago but then quickly dropped _ ensuring proper disposal of waste created in hospitals, laboratories and clinics. `` This is not just a question of a bloody syringe washing up on a beach on the <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Wyden </PERSON>, D-Ore. `` The medical waste system in this country is broken and inefficient and is regurgitating what it ca n't keep down.

 A <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> consultant charged with insider trading involving a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> contract discussed the project with a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> assistant secretary who has been named as a target in the government's defense procurement probe, according to the consultant's attorney. Charles A. Mills of <LOCATION> Beachwood </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, who had served as a consultant to the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> in a project to develop a new generation of blimps, agreed Wednesday to pay $ 9,315 to settle a civil complaint filed by the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> said it was continuing its investigation, and its complaint cited a meeting between <PERSON> Mills </PERSON> and `` a certain then assistant secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>,'' whom it did not identify further. However, sources speaking on condition of anonymity indicated it was <PERSON> Melvyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON>, who was assistant secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> for research, engineering and systems, and has since been named as a target of a <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> probe into <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> purchasing practices. <PERSON> Lawrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Barcella </PERSON>, <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON>'s attorney, said his client has not been subpoenaed or otherwise notified by the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> that he is the subject of an investigation. Moreover, he said the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> complaint does not imply that the unidentified assistant secretary did anything improper. According to the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> complaint, <PERSON> Mills </PERSON>, in his role as a consultant from February to May 1987, had access to confidential information about competing bids for a contract worth $ 168.9 million to develop a prototype of a radar-surveillance blimp to help protect <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> fleets. Through meetings with Naval officials, including one on March 13, 1987 attended by the unidentified assistant secretary, <PERSON> Mills </PERSON> learned the officials favored a bid from a joint venture of <ORGANIZATION> Westinghouse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Airship </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Cardington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> alleged. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schupper </PERSON>, <PERSON> Mills </PERSON>' attorney, said his client told him Wednesday that he met once with <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON> and other officials for five or 10 minutes, but was not certain of the date. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> announced the contract award June 5. A day earlier, according to the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Mills </PERSON> purchased receipts on the over-the-counter market in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for the purchase of <ORGANIZATION> Airship </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> stock, which is traded in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Sydney </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mills </PERSON> sold the receipts June 8 and 9, earning a profit of $ 4,658, the agency said. Without admitting or denying the charges, <PERSON> Mills </PERSON> agreed to return the profits and pay an equal amount as a penalty. The <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> also said `` certain assistant secretaries of the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'' were briefed on the bid award June 3 and 4. By that time, <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON>, who was appointed assistant secretary in 1981, was out of government, according to <PERSON> Barcella </PERSON>. The blimp contract had a potential value of $ 3 billion if the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> had decided to build a fleet of airships. However, the program was scrapped following agreement between the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in late 1987 on a plan to reduce the federal budget deficit. <PERSON> Schupper </PERSON> said <PERSON> Mills </PERSON> had not believed he did anything wrong and cooperated fully with the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION>. `` In light of his health and his financial resources, he believes that the settlement represents a fair resolution of conflicting conclusions drawn from basically the same facts,'' <PERSON> Schupper </PERSON> said. The <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is investigating whether private consultants, many of them former <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> employees, paid bribes to <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials for inside information about contracts, chiefly within the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>. The probe became public in June after subpoenas were issued in the case. No one has been charged yet. Investigators have searched <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON>'s home looking for evidence that he took payments from defense contractors while he was at the Pentagon. Investigators also have alleged in court papers that while <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON> was a consultant to <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, he improperly provided the company with secret <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> documents about its competitors. Through his attorney, <PERSON> Paisley </PERSON> has said the government has provided no evidence to support such allegations.

<HEAD>Congress May Complete Its Spending Bills On Time _ For a Change</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the White House may be about to accomplish something they've not done since <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> was president _ enact all federal spending bills before the start of the fiscal year. Although it's not likely to spark a giddy citizenry into launching fireworks, approval by Saturday of all 13 spending bills would be a political coup for both parties. It's already inspired people on both ends of <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Avenue </LOCATION> to begin publicly patting themselves on the back. `` We're showing that we can govern,'' Rep. <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>, D-Calif., the No 3 <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Democratic leader, said Wednesday. `` The warning has been taken to heart,'' said President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. He was referring to a promise he made in January that if the spending measures were wrapped into a single piece of legislation, he would veto it. As the start of the new fiscal year approaches, lawmakers and the administration are working out disputes that in ordinary years could take weeks or months to resolve. Thus, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, who signed his first appropriations bill for the new year on July 19, signed the sixth into law Wednesday, a measure appropriating $ 8.8 billion for military construction. In addition, a $ 15 billion spending measure for the <ORGANIZATION> Commerce </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> and State departments and a $ 10.8 billion transportation bill were on his desk. Legislative action on the five remaining appropriations measures was scheduled for today and Friday. This is no ordinary year. It's an election year, and Republicans and Democrats want to avoid any blame for a replay of last year's budget embarrassment `` In an election year, neither side wanted to face responsibility for a massive CR,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Alaska </LOCATION>, using the initials for `` continuing resolution'' _ legislative lingo for a giant spending bill. `` This helps incumbents, period,'' said <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>. `` The more you make the process work, the more you help incumbents.'' Last December, after a year of inconclusive squabbling between <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> signed a 1,400-page, $ 600 billion behemoth that contained all the money federal agencies needed to function this year. Within hours of receiving it, the president signed it. The alternative was shutting down the government. In January, an angry <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> used his nationally televised State of the Union address to promise to veto any similar bill this year. <ORGANIZATION> Congressional </ORGANIZATION> leaders called on the president to work with them to smooth out any disputes that might arise, and pledged to avoid a catchall measure for 1989. The most serious stumbling block this year had been defense spending. But on Wednesday, <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> resolved a long-running dispute over <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Wars </ORGANIZATION> and arms control restrictions with both the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approving a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> authorization bill. That made congressional action possible by Friday on a separate $ 300 billion Pentagon spending measure. The quicker-than-usual action this year is due in part to last fall's budget summit agreement between <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and congressional leaders. In that pact, both sides agreed to broad spending totals for 1989, leaving only less-sweeping issues to be worked out. <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> and other Democrats are crediting their own leadership for the rapid movement of the spending bills. `` We announced at the beginning of the year that we'd do it,'' <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> said. Even if all 13 bills are not enacted by 12:01 a.m. Saturday, there would be little immediate impact. Federal workers deemed essential _ including the military _ would be permitted to work over the weekend. Government agencies would not have to shut down unless spending legislation was not in place by Monday.

 For President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, his trip to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> for the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> meant a dramatic farewell appearance.

After his speech, he went to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mission </LOCATION> to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> for lunch. It's just across the street, so most people would walk. Presidential security, however, required that he make the crossing by motorcade.

 Then it was off to the <LOCATION> Waldorf-Astoria </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hotel </LOCATION>, a few blocks away. The Waldorf had warned its guests of what was coming. `` It is my great pleasure to tell you that President <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> will be staying in the <ORGANIZATION> Waldorf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Towers </ORGANIZATION> during your stay in the hotel,'' manager <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Cotter </PERSON> said in a letter handed out at the registration desk. `` Unfortunately, however, it may mean some inconvenience for you,'' <PERSON> Cotter </PERSON> added. `` To ensure the president's safety, the Park Avenue entrance will be closed from 5:30 to 7:30 p.m. on Monday evening. Please be so kind as to enter and exit the hotel from the <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Avenue </LOCATION> area.'' One woman entering the hotel from <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Avenue </LOCATION> still found herself inconvenienced when she was asked by a White House aide to step aside while the traveling pool of journalists made their way through the door. `` But we're staying here,'' she protested.

 Once inside, the pool was taken by elevator to a holding room on the 33rd floor to wait until it was time to walk up three floors to where the president was holding the first in a series of meetings with foreign leaders. After a brief picture-taking and question-asking opportunity, the scribes scrambled back down to the holding room to file stories by telephone and wait for the next meeting. In a few minutes, however, a harried assistant manager of the hotel showed up to announce that the room set aside as the holding room turned out to be part of a suite rented to a permanent hotel guest. So it was out in the hall for the reporters and their telephones.

<TEXT>
 The next event after the series of meetings was an evening reception in a room decked with magnificent crystal chandeliers. To get to it, reporters were ushered through the kitchen, past tray after tray of dirty dishes, before standing in line to have security officers check their equipment. Next morning, reporters were assembled in their third-floor press room and taken to three elevators for the ride back up to the 33rd floor to wait for more meetings. At the ninth floor, one of the elevators got stuck for 10 minutes. Word of the mishap apparently even got to the president. When the media people arrived on the 36th floor for <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s meeting with Foreign Minister <PERSON> Sahabzada </PERSON> <PERSON> Yaqub </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, the president told them, `` You seem like you've been breathing hard I'm trying to pick out the ones who had to walk up the stairs.''

<HEAD>Reagan Vetoes Textile Bill _ Sponsors Hoping for Override</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Lawmakers are mapping efforts to override President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s veto of tightened curbs on textile, apparel and shoe imports, but they concede it will be difficult. `` It's going to be an uphill fight but it can be done with a lot of hard work and a little luck,'' Rep. <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> <PERSON> Derrick </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-S.C. </LOCATION>, said Wednesday after <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> vetoed the measure and called it an example of `` protectionism at its worst.'' At a Rose Garden ceremony Wednesday, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> also signed legislation to phase out virtually all tariffs between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>. The Canadian <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION> has yet to give final approval to the measure, and as a result it is uncertain whether the free-trade plan can be launched next year as scheduled. The textile bill, designed to protect American companies from foreign competition, would freeze textile and apparel imports at 1987 levels for the rest of the year and limit subsequent growth to 1 percent a year. It would freeze non-rubber footwear imports at 1987 levels with no provision for any increase in market share for foreign producers. Expanded market share, however, would be the reward of countries that bought more <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agricultural products. That's a sweetener designed to win over Farm Belt lawmakers wary lest Asian textile-producing countries retaliate against the stiffened import limits by slashing purchases of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> wheat and feed grains. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> called the U.S.-Canada pact `` a hallmark of free trade'' and the opposite of the textile legislation he had just vetoed. `` Protectionism does not save jobs,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> declared. He said the bill `` would have disasterous effects on the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. economy.'' `` It would impose needless costs on American consumers, threaten jobs in our export industries, jeopardize our overseas farm sales and undermine our efforts to obtain a more open trading system for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> exports,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said. `` At a time when <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> exports are booming, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> must not embark on a course that would diminish our trade opportunities,'' he said. He added that the measure could `` break the clothing budgets of many American families.'' On <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION>, a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> override effort was tentativeliy set for next Tuesday. In votes thus far, however, sponsors have never mustered the two-thirds they need to pass the measure into law over <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s objections. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> approved the bill 248-150 on Friday. Earlier, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> passed the measure 59-36. Sponsors said they now were perhaps eight votes short of what they need and vowed to mount a last-ditch effort to turn the tide. Democrats were quick to pounce on <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s second veto of textile trade legislation in the last three years. They have been portraying the measure as designed to shield blue-collar workers from layoffs brought on by burgeoning textile and apparel imports. `` Maybe <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> will be remembered as a great president,'' said <PERSON> Derrick </PERSON>. `` But not by the American textile worker.'' `` The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration likes to pretend that it was an innocent bystander to the foreign assault on our textile, apparel and footwear industries, but that's not true,'' said <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>. `` In failing to implement the trade laws, the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> has been an accessory to the assault.''

<HEAD>Anti-Porn Measure Creates New Crimes, New Punishments</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 New crimes and new punishments are created in an anti-pornography measure approved by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, including life prison terms for child selling and $ 250,000 fines for transmitting obscene dial-a-porn messages. The chamber voted 97-0 to approve the obscenity measure, tacking it onto a controversial family leave bill with an uncertain future. Final action on the two-part bill was expected late today. The unanimous vote on the obscenity amendment followed hours of senatorial hand-wringing over child porn profiteers, a few constitutional reservations and several references, veiled and unveiled, to the demands of a political season. `` Those who vote against this ought to do so at their own peril,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Orrin </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Utah </LOCATION>. `` It's time for the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> to set the standard in this area, for us to stand up and do what we should do, and I know that everybody in this body recognizes this filth problem.'' The amendment, sponsored by Sen. <PERSON> Strom </PERSON> <PERSON> Thurmond </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-S.C. </LOCATION>, makes it easier to prosecute crimes and secure civil penalties in cases involving child pornography and obscene materials. The measure also sets stiff fines and prison terms, including 20 years to life for buying or selling children for use in child pornography. It was added to a bill requiring large companies to offer at least 10 weeks of unpaid, job-protected leave to employees with medical crises or new babies. <PERSON> Thurmond </PERSON> has been among the conservatives leading the charge against the leave bill. But <PERSON> Thurmond </PERSON> and <PERSON> Hatch </PERSON> complained that although the child pornography bill had 45 co-sponsors, other members blocked it from coming up in the <ORGANIZATION> Judiciary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> for seven months. They said this was the only way to bring it to the floor. The Thurmond amendment would: _ Ban buying and selling of children for use in child pornography _ Ban the use of computers to distribute or advertise child pornography _ Require producers of sexually explicit material to document the ages of persons appearing in the material _ Give states clear authority to regulate obscene or indecent programming on cable and subscription television services This would overturn a <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision. _ Raise the maximum penalties for transmitting obscene dial-a-porn messages from six months in jail and a $ 50,000 fine to two years and $ 250,000 _ Make it illegal to sell or possess obscene material or child pornography on federal lands Individuals could be fined up to $ 5,000 and sentenced to six months in jail for possession; up to $ 250,000 and two years in jail for sale. _ Make it easier for prosecutors to file civil forfeiture suits against people possessing obscene materials and set fines of up to $ 250,000 for people who possess obscene material in violation of obscenity statutes Not voting on the measure were Sens. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ind </LOCATION>., the two vice presidential nominees, and <PERSON> Spark </PERSON> <PERSON> Matsunaga </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Hawaii </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Arlen </PERSON> <PERSON> Specter </PERSON>, R-Pa., cited several areas of constitutional concern including what he called the `` very troubling'' federal lands provision He said it would encompass the entire <LOCATION> Virgin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> and Indian territory, national parks, military bases and federal buildings. The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> is trying to protect children, `` not trying to reach a soldier who has an obscene book in his car,'' <PERSON> Specter </PERSON> said. But <PERSON> Thurmond </PERSON> insisted his bill is constitutional and said <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> should n't waste time quibbling. `` We are trying to ban obscenity,'' he said. `` If you want to protect the children of this country, you've got to take a stand.''

<TEXT>
 Social Security, in sickness and in health, has been one of the Democratic party's most potent political weapons of the 1980s. This election, like the past two, finds the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> candidate accusing his Republican rival of harboring malevolent intentions toward the program that 38 million retirees, disabled workers and their dependents rely on. The Social Security issue was of scant help to <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> and <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON> against <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, but <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is hoping that this fall it will give voters pause about backing <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. The $ 210 billion retirement and disability program, on the verge of bankruptcy five short years ago, now is piling up huge surpluses. Its trust funds which grew to $ 69 billion last year, will add $ 40 billion more in 1988 and are expected to swell to $ 646 billion by the end of 1995. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, in last Sunday's debate, accused <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> of planning to `` raid the Social Security trust fund'' to help reduce the deficit and pay for tax cuts and <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> weapons. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has said repeatedly he will not touch Social Security. It is the one program he plans to exempt from his `` flexible freeze'' to curb the deficit. A <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spokesman, <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Sandor </PERSON>, dismissed <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' raid charge as `` an effort to terrorize <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s elderly into political submission.'' The Republican commissioner of Social Security, <PERSON> Dorcas </PERSON> <PERSON> Hardy </PERSON>, points out that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> recently used $ 27 million in surplus pension funds to help balance the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> budget. Social Security did n't save <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> or Mondale, but Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, R-Kan., said it was the issue that cost Republicans control of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in 1986 <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> advises, `` When it comes to Social Security and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, do n't read his lips, read his record.'' As president of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, he cast a tie-breaking vote on May 9, 1985, against exempting Social Security's cost-of-living adjustment from a fiscal 1986 budget freeze. The tally was 50-49. That freeze never materialized. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, after initially supporting it, abandoned the package and it died. Afterwards, he adopted a hands-off policy toward Social Security that he has stuck to _ and which <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> promises to emulate. In 1981, in the throes of Social Security's difficulties and in his quest to cut federal spending, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> sought sweeping cuts in benefits for early retirees and others. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> eliminated college students' benefits and some others, but refused to go along with the steepest cuts. In this campaign, as in 1986, Mr. Senior Citizen himself, 88-year-old Democratic Rep. <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Pepper </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, will be on the airwaves attacking the Republicans on Social Security. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citizens </ORGANIZATION> is running Pepper ads attacking <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and distributing posters that scream, `` <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> whacked my Social Security on May 9, 1985.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has charged that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would have to `` raid the trust fund'' if he is serious about reducing the deficit while buying more military weapons and cutting the capital gains tax. In fact, the growing trust funds already help reduce the deficit. Although Social Security's trust funds technically are listed apart from the government's other accounts, they are lumped together for purposes of the Gramm-Rudman deficit reduction law. Federal law prohibits spending Social Security's reserves on other programs, but every dollar added to the trust funds reduces the overall deficit. And since the trust funds must be invested in interest-bearing <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> securities, they reduce the amount the government must borrow in private markets. The government uses the funds generated by selling bonds to Social Security to cover the operating deficit in the rest of its programs. Still, there have been calls for changes in Social Security outside the immediate political debate. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s two main economic advisers, <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Feldstein </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Boskin </PERSON>, have been prominent academic critics of Social Security. <PERSON> Feldstein </PERSON> has argued that Social Security depresses private savings. He also has proposed restricting cost-of-living increases to the Consumer Price Index minus 2 percentage points. <PERSON> Boskin </PERSON>, in a 1986 book, `` Too Many Promises: The Uncertain Future of Social Security,'' proposed to revamp Social Security to separate its insurance and welfare aspects. <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON>, the former <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> party </ORGANIZATION> chairman and co-chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, touched off a firestorm Sept. 20 when he said that if the budget is to be balanced, then `` we have to go to Social Security, <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> and entitlements generally and we have to go to defense.'' Both the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaigns disavowed <PERSON> Strauss </PERSON>' statement. Other Democrats have spoken favorably of making more retirees pay income tax on their benefits. Only one retiree in 10 now is taxed on Social Security.

<HEAD>First Revision of Pesticide Safety Law in Decade Gets Approval</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The first major revision of the nation's pesticide control law in a decade is headed for President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s desk with praise from lawmakers and lukewarm support from `` After 10 years we've seen a major breakthrough,'' <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON>, D-Vt., said at a news conference Wednesday following <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approval on a voice vote The measure cleared the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> last week and sponsors expected no problem with the administration over the measure, which would accelerate safety reviews of potentially hazardous chemicals sprayed on crops. The bill, designed to speed the banning of pesticides too dangerous for use, would set a nine-year deadline for finishing <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> reviews of some 600 active pesticide ingredients. Completion of the work would not come until the year 2024 at the present pace, according to the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>. The bill also would take a sizeable financial load off taxpayer shoulders and hand it to pesticide manufacturers. Most government indemnities to companies for banned chemicals would be phased out. The industry would pay for the safety reviews as well as a large portion of storage and disposal costs. The measure also would reauthorize for three years the 1947 Federal Insecticide, Fungicide and Rodenticide Act, which got its last facelift in 1978. Since then, a decade of efforts to speed up the safety reviewing process has produced nothing more than political snarls. Environmentalists have been calling for tightened pesticide controls for more than two decades amid evidence that some of the 2.6 billion pounds a year of chemicals sprayed on crops can cause cancer, birth defects and other health problems. Eventually, the pesticides find their way to American dinner tables. Lawmakers did not paint the bill as a full-scale answer to the pesticide issue. Missing was any effort to cope with the problem of pesticide contamination of groundwater, which provides the basic drinking supply for an estimated 113 million Americans. Seventy-three pesticides have been reported in groundwater in 34 states, the Capitol Hill-based <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> reported recently after examining EPA records. The agency says it is now trying to determine the extent of contamination with a nationwide survey. Lawmakers held out the possibility Wednesday that they could tackle the groundwater program when <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> returns to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> next year. `` Now we have to tie together our agricultural programs and our environmental goals and enact a groundwater program to protect the health of the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people,'' said <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON>. He had backed inclusion of groundwater features but was unable to command a majority on the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. Flanking <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON> at a news conference, Sen. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> G. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lugar </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ind </LOCATION>., said groundwater provisions `` are on the agenda'' for next year `` It has much more of a constituency than it had before,'' <PERSON> Lugar </PERSON> said. `` Before it was much more of an environmental interest. Now it has considerable farm interest.'' Environmentalists were lukewarm in their assessment of the bill. `` As passed, the bill does not even qualify for a bronze medal,'' said <PERSON> Rick </PERSON> <PERSON> Hind </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>. `` On a scale of one to ten this deserves a three. ... It gives <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> another excuse to postpone important items like groundwater, farm worker safety and food safety.'' <PERSON> Laura </PERSON> <PERSON> Rhodes </PERSON> of Capitol Hill-based <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Citizen </ORGANIZATION> said the group was `` pleased that <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has at long last begun reforming this country's ineffective pesticide laws, but we are hungry to see <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> tackle food safety, groundwater and farm worker safety provisions next session.'' `` The bill is n't perfect but it's a necessary first step to a rational pesticide policy,'' said <PERSON> Janet </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hathaway </PERSON>, project attorney of the Natural Resources Defense Council. The group took actress Meryl Streep on a tour of <LOCATION> Capitol </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hill </LOCATION> offices to drum up support for the measure. <PERSON> Leahy </PERSON> echoed a concern of many environmentalists that <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> has dragged its feet because it was unwilling to spend the money for intensified safety efforts. Shifting the burden in large part to the industry should alleviate some of that fear, he said.

<HEAD>Many Younger Teachers Looking for New Careers, Survey Finds</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CRISPIN Y. CAMPBELL</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 More young teachers are planning to change careers, despite an increase in job satisfaction in the profession as a whole, according to a national survey released today. The 1988 Survey of the American Teacher found that 34 percent of teachers with less than five years experience said they planned to leave teaching, up from 19 percent in 1985. Planned defections from teaching were especially common among black and Hispanic teachers, the survey said. Forty-one percent of all minority group teachers polled said they were likely to leave teaching in the next five years, compared with only 25 percent of all non-minority teachers. The planned defections among younger teachers came despite an overall increase in job satisfaction among teachers, the survey reported. Fifty percent of those surveyed said they were satisfied overall with their jobs, up from 40 percent in 1985. The survey also found that the proportion of those earning more than $ 30,000 doubled since 1985, rising from 13 percent to 26 percent. The survey was sponsored by Metropolitan Life and conducted between April and June of this year by <ORGANIZATION> Louis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION>. The company questioned 1,208 teachers and 2,700 public school students in grades four through 12. Results in most cases had margins of error between 2 and 3 percentage points. Most of the teachers surveyed described their relationship with students as `` cooperative'' and `` respectful.'' Seventy-one percent characterized the relationship as cooperative and 68 percent said it was respectful. Similarly, 70 percent of all students polled characterized student-teacher relationships in their schools as either `` good'' or `` excellent.'' Still, the survey indicated that most students are either ambivalent about school, 33 percent, or say they do n't enjoy it, 23 percent.

<TEXT>
 Communist leaders gather Friday for a hastily called meeting on the country's political future, expected to discuss lifting party control on day-to-day management of the economy and allowing multiple-candidate elections. The plenary session of the 300-member <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> will discuss changes key to Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s goal of promoting efficiency in government by making the 20 million-member <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> focus on ideology and policy goals. The Central Committee session, announced Wednesday, had been planned for a long time but the specific date had not been set. `` The plenary will be devoted to reorganization of the party apparatus, including the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> itself,'' <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> told reporters at the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, where Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> was attending the General Assembly session. When the announcement was made, <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> and other Soviet officials rushed back home from trips abroad. `` There will be changes in the working of our political structure,'' <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> said. One of the key political reforms involves the strengthening of the office of president of the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, a government post. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has said the largely figurehead position should be expanded to include primary responsibility for defense and foreign affairs. On Wednesday, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said nothing short of a wholesale overhaul of the political system will do. `` Any of the current burning problems underscores the necessity of radical change. It is needed in the party, in the state, in agriculture, in industry, in personnel policy and most of all in people's mentality, in their attitudes to work, to one another and to themselves,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said at a <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> dinner honoring visiting East German leader <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION>, the official Soviet news agency, carried the only <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> media report about the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> plenum. It quoted <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON>'s announcement at the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. Two Soviet sources in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> dismissed speculation of an emergency or that the meeting concerned the Soviet withdrawal from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. They spoke to reporters at a reception at the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Ambassador's residence. `` There is no crisis,'' said one highly placed source in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>, a member of the 13-man Politburo, would attend any meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. All committee members who are abroad, including a number of ambassadors, were summoned, <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Valentin </PERSON> <PERSON> Falin </PERSON>, head of the government press agency <ORGANIZATION> Novosti </ORGANIZATION>, told a reporter at the ambassador's reception that <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> leaders would meet Friday to discuss political reforms mapped out at the 19th party conference in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> June 28-July 2. He declined to specify the topic. On July 29, the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> adopted a timetable for overhauling the Soviet political system. The first deadline set was October, by which time the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> said a draft law on amendments to the Soviet Constitution and on multi-candidate elections of legislators was to be completed. The <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> is empowered to make personnel changes in the Politburo. At the 19th party conference, one delegate suggested that holdovers from the 18-year tenure of Soviet president <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> be eased out of the leadership. The delegate specifically named President <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gromyko </PERSON>, 79, and fellow Politburo member <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Solomentsev </PERSON>, 76, as leaders who should retire. Since the conference, <PERSON> Gromyko </PERSON> has continued meeting visiting foreign statemen, and is scheduled to visit <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> during the first 10 days of October. The <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> era is now widely condemned for allowing rampant corruption and decay of the Soviet economy and making mistakes in foreign policy.

<HEAD>Third Conviction `Only The Beginning,' Says DEA</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The conviction of three Mexican nationals in a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> drug agent's murder in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> is being hailed by federal law enforcement officials as `` only the beginning'' toward bringing all the killers to justice. `` Our goal is to see that everyone who participated in the torture and kidnapping and murder of agent <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON> is brought to justice,'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Bonner </PERSON> told reporters after Wednesday's verdict against the third of three co-defendants. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawn </PERSON>, chief of the <ORGANIZATION> Drug </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enforcement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, said he will press `` the crusade for justice'' in <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON>'s killing, which authorities allege was masterminded by reputed Mexican drug baron <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON> <PERSON> Caro </PERSON> <PERSON> Quintero </PERSON>. The eight-week trial included evidence that <LOCATION> Mexican </LOCATION> police took bribes to protect drug smugglers, and the case strained U.S.-Mexican relations. A <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> jury that deliberated six days returned its last verdict Wednesday, finding convicted drug trafficker <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Felix </PERSON> <PERSON> Gutierrez </PERSON>, 38, guilty of aiding and abetting the 1985 torture-murders of <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON> and his pilot, <PERSON> Alfredo </PERSON> <PERSON> Zavala </PERSON> <PERSON> Avelar </PERSON>. Jurors concluded <PERSON> Felix </PERSON> helped <PERSON> Caro </PERSON> escape to <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> after the murders. Authorities allege that <PERSON> Caro </PERSON> wanted revenge for <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> raids on his marijuana plantations. Earlier, the same jury convicted a homicide investigator in <LOCATION> Guadalajara </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Raul </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> <PERSON> Alvarez </PERSON>, 28; and a drug trafficker, <PERSON> Rene </PERSON> <PERSON> Verdugo </PERSON> <PERSON> Urquidez </PERSON>, 36, of participating in the kidnap-murders. `` This is only the beginning,'' said <ORGANIZATION> DEA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Zienter </PERSON>. `` We are well aware that there are other people involved in the murder of Special Agent <PERSON> Enrique </PERSON> <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON>.'' <PERSON> Bonner </PERSON> said he hoped other defendants in custody in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, including <PERSON> Caro </PERSON>, would be convicted. Should they be acquitted, he said, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> might move to extradite them. <PERSON> Caro </PERSON>, 37, has been convicted on weapons and narcotics charges, but the <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON> murder charge is pending. <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON> was kidnapped from outside the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> consulate in <LOCATION> Guadalajara </LOCATION> on Feb. 7, 1985. The battered bodies of <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON> and his pilot were found at a remote ranch on March 5, 1985. Jurors heard a dramatic audio tape of <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON>'s last hours in which he begged his captors to stop the torture. `` Do n't hit me anymore!'' he pleaded. <PERSON> Felix </PERSON>'s attorney told reporters he will appeal his client's conviction `` I asked a question before the trial _ could a Mexican drug dealer receive a fair trial in this kind of case with these kind of brutal facts in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>? I think the answer is: It's impossible,'' said attorney <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> <PERSON> Tarlow </PERSON> Jurors were hurriedly escorted out of the courthouse by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> marshals. The three men tried here had never met before they were brought to court. <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON>, who was born in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> but grew up in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, returned to his native <PERSON> Guadalaljara </PERSON> where he became a member of the homicide squad with the <LOCATION> Jalisco </LOCATION> state police. Jurors saw a secretly recorded videotape of <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> discussing details of <PERSON> Camarena </PERSON>'s murder. <PERSON> Verdugo </PERSON>, described as <PERSON> Caro </PERSON>'s chief lieutenant, was linked to the murder scene by a strand of hair. Two government informants said they heard him discuss the crime. <PERSON> Felix </PERSON>, who operated a seafood company in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, was implicated by government informants who said he spoke of arranging <PERSON> Caro </PERSON>'s escape to <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION>. Judge <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafeedie </PERSON> said he would sentence <PERSON> Felix </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Verdugo </LOCATION> on Oct. 26 and <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> on Oct. 24. <PERSON> Bonner </PERSON> said he would seek the maximum sentences: life imprisonment for <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Verdugo </LOCATION>, 10 years for <PERSON> Felix </PERSON>. Nine men were indicted in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> in the murders but only three were tried here. One was subsequently killed in a shootout. Four, including <PERSON> Caro </PERSON>, were tried in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Caro </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ernesto </PERSON> <PERSON> Fonseca </PERSON> <PERSON> Carillo </PERSON>, 63, were sentenced on weapons and narcotics convictions last week. <PERSON> Caro </PERSON> was sentenced to 34 years and <PERSON> Fonseca </PERSON> 11 years. <PERSON> Bonner </PERSON> said verdicts on the murder charges in <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> are not expected until January.

<HEAD>Foreign Minister's Visit To Moscow Sign Of Warming Ties</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Relations between <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, strained by nearly three decades of ill will, took a major step toward normalization with the announcement that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s foreign minister will visit <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> this year. <PERSON> Qian </PERSON> <PERSON> Qichen </PERSON>'s visit is expected to advance talks on ending <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s occupation of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, the most serious issue dividing the two Communist powers, and set the stage for the first Sino-Soviet summit since 1959. The trip was announced Wednesday at <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> following a meeting between <PERSON> Qian </PERSON> and his Soviet counterpart, <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>. Soviet <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> said <PERSON> Qian </PERSON> `` agreed to come to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> at the end of this year, where the negotiations will be continued on the Kampuchean -LRB- <LOCATION> Cambodian </LOCATION> -RRB- question and bilateral questions.'' He said <PERSON> Qian </PERSON> will meet Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and that <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> would visit <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> at a later date. Chinese radio and the official press today mentioned <PERSON> Qian </PERSON>'s proposed visit to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in reports on his meeting with <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>, but did not give prominent play to the announcement <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s leading daily, the <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION>, noted plans for the trip in the second paragraph of a story carried on page six, its international news page. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> split over ideological and strategic differences around 1960, with hostilities increasing until the two sides fought a brief border war in 1969. Political normalization talks, accompanied by increased trade and other unofficial contacts, began in 1982, but <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has refused to fully restore normal relations until `` three obstacles'' are removed. Two of those obstacles have been lowered with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> beginning its withdrawal of troops from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and the reduction of tensions on the Sino-Soviet border, but <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> support for <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s military occupation of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> remains a key point of dispute. Last month, Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister <PERSON> Igor </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogachev </PERSON> flew to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> for the first Sino-Soviet talks on how to solve the Cambodian question. Soviet officials in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> said the talks produced broad points of agreement on <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, with the timetable for <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s withdrawal being the major stumbling block <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> says its pullout will be complete by early 1990. The officials said they expected that further progress could be made at the Qian-Shevardnadze talks in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, paving the way for improved ties. Soviet spokesman <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON>, asked if <PERSON> Qian </PERSON>'s visit could lead to a Sino-Soviet summit, replied, `` We hope so. We are ready for it. We hope. We emphasize that everything in Soviet-Chinese relations must be normalized. We are on the way.'' <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON>, in an interview with <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> earlier this month, stressed that improved relations with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> were in the interests of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and of world peace. He also said that <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> will never return to the relationship of the 1950s, when <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> played big brother to the fledgling Communist government in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> and that better Sino-Soviet ties will not affect <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s good relations with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Chinese and Soviet vice foreign ministers have exchanged visits repeatedly in the last few years for talks on Chinese-Soviet border issues. <PERSON> Qian </PERSON> went to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> several times in that capacity. He became foreign minister in April. The forthcoming visit of the 60-year-old Qian, a <LOCATION> Russian </LOCATION> speaker who has been posted in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, marks the first working visit of a <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> foreign minister in at least 20 years. Former Chinese Foreign Minister <PERSON> Huang </PERSON> <PERSON> Hua </PERSON> went to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in 1982 to attend the funeral of Soviet leader <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>, but it was not a working visit. The last Soviet foreign minister to visit <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> was <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> Gromyko </PERSON>, now <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> president, who went there in 1959. In that year, then-Soviet leader <PERSON> Nikita </PERSON> <PERSON> Khruschev </PERSON> came to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> and denounced <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 Eighty lucky ninth-graders in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> got front-row seats for today's launch of Discovery, but some pupils were n't allowed to watch the live television coverage to spare them possible trauma in the event something went wrong. In <LOCATION> Concord </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.H. </LOCATION>, the home of Challenger teacher-astronaut <PERSON> Christa </PERSON> <PERSON> McAuliffe </PERSON>, nothing special was planned. And plans for a nationwide educational project built around <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s return to manned spaceflight fell through. Millions of schoolchildren were watching when the last shuttle lifted off on Jan. 28, 1986, because of <PERSON> McAuliffe </PERSON>, who was to give lessons from space. When Challenger blew up 73 seconds after launch, killing the seven astronauts aboard, students gathered in a festive assembly at <PERSON> McAuliffe </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Concord </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> were watching on live television. This time, no organized school events were scheduled in <LOCATION> Concord </LOCATION>. `` Perhaps our relationship to <PERSON> Christa </PERSON> will mean more classrooms will watch it, but I do n't think it's going to be a big deal,'' schools Superintendent <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Beauvais </PERSON> said Wednesday. `` We certainly are n't going to push it to make it one.'' <ORGANIZATION> Concord </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> banned reporters from the school's buildings and grounds. At <ORGANIZATION> Kimball </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, where <PERSON> McAuliffe </PERSON>'s son, <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>, is in the sixth grade and daughter, <PERSON> Caroline </PERSON>, is in the third, <PERSON> Principal </PERSON> <PERSON> Clint </PERSON> <PERSON> Cogswell </PERSON> said he expected some classes would watch the launch _ but not <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>'s or <PERSON> Caroline </PERSON>'s. The Discovery mission excited teachers and students in <LOCATION> Willmar </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>, where crew member <PERSON> George </PERSON> `` Pinky'' <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON> grew up. `` It's kind of a local hero thing,'' said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Christenson </PERSON>, director of elementary education in the city of 16,000. `` With the launch, all the TV coverage and the balloons, and some kids are making colored prints of the launch site which will be on exhibit ... they are getting excited.'' <ORGANIZATION> Tumbleweed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Palmdale </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, planned to celebrate the launch by firing model rockets into space, science teacher <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Whiddison </PERSON> said. The students, some with parents who worked on the shuttle, have been studying rocket designs. The desert community of <LOCATION> Palmdale </LOCATION> is south of <ORGANIZATION> Edwards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION>, where the shuttle is to land. <PERSON> Geraldine </PERSON> <PERSON> Haracz </PERSON>, a fourth-grade teacher at <ORGANIZATION> Edwards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, wore a space suit and explained mission control to students watching the Challenger launch. She planned the same for today. `` I think we have helped them understand that this was one moment of tragedy that will help us go on'' and learn more about space, said <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Haracz </PERSON>. In <LOCATION> Greenwich </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Julian </PERSON> <PERSON> Curtiss </PERSON> School Principal <PERSON> Linda </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartzer </PERSON> said she planned to videotape the launch and show it to her elementary school pupils if it succeeds. `` Obviously, if it was a deadly experience, we would handle it a different way,'' she said. <PERSON> Hartzer </PERSON> said a school team of psychologists, educators, counselors and social workers would decide what to do in that case. The Challenger Center, which was formed by the Challenger astronauts' families to promote space education, had hoped to distribute free `` Countdown 5-4-3-2-1'' kits to the nation's 65,000 elementary schools before Discovery's launch, said spokesman <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Hutto </PERSON>. But the kits wo n't be ready to be mailed until late next week, said <PERSON> Liz </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, an administrative assistant for the <ORGANIZATION> Challenger </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>'s education department in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. However, all is not lost, <PERSON> Hutto </PERSON> said. `` There were some specific things about this launch, but the kits are designed to be generic,'' he said. `` It's written in such a way it could be used on future flights.'' For today's flight, 80 students from <ORGANIZATION> Lincoln </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Academy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pierce </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, had a clear view of the launch from the parking lot of a <ORGANIZATION> McDonald </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> restaurant in <LOCATION> Titusville </LOCATION> three miles from the pad. Restaurant manager <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Reed </PERSON> said the students got exclusive rights to the parking lot, beating out news organizations, because they asked first.

<TEXT>
 A newly formed paramilitary unit joined police in violently crushing a demonstration by tens of thousands of Lithuanians against Soviet control of their Baltic republic, a witness said. Up to 40 demonstrators, some bloodied from beatings by truncheon-wielding police, were arrested during the rally in the capital's republic, <LOCATION> Vilnius </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Valdas </PERSON> <PERSON> Analauskas </PERSON>, correspondent for the unofficial journal <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chronicle </ORGANIZATION>. He said some demonstrators fought back by throwing stones during the four-hour protest on Wednesday. The officers surrounded Gediminas Square at 5 p.m., when the protest was to begin. They pushed and shoved some of the hordes of people gathered there, he said in a telephone interview. Many protesters moved to a nearby park, but when 60-year-old former political prisoner <PERSON> Antanas </PERSON> <PERSON> Terleckas </PERSON> began to speak through a megaphone, police moved in and beat demonstrators with rubber truncheons, <PERSON> Analauskas </PERSON> said. He said the protesters shouted, `` Occupiers, get out of here!'' Paramilitary police, recently formed nationwide to keep order at demonstrations and control, joined local police in cracking down on the demonstration, <PERSON> Analauskas </PERSON> said. He said they charged four times to disperse the gathering. The official Soviet news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said hundreds of people tried to hold a meeting, but police prevented it from being held. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said about 20 people were arrested in <LOCATION> Vilnius </LOCATION> for hooliganism and disobeying police orders. The demonstration was called to press Soviet authorities to publish the secret 1939 non-aggression pact signed by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> under which the two powers divided <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, assigning the Baltic republcs of <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION> to the Soviet sphere of influence.

<HEAD>Company Drops Claims After Media Inquiries</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 An insurance company that demanded more than $ 19,000 from a janitor and his mentally retarded wife because of fire damage caused by their 6-year-old daughter dropped the claim after reporters inquired about it. <PERSON> Suzanne </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> agonized for nearly a month over how they would repay Fireman's <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cos. </ORGANIZATION> for damages caused to their former apartment by the March blaze. Fireman's Fund, which insured the building, told the <PERSON> Deans </PERSON> they could pay $ 50 a month for the next 32 years to repay the $ 19,616 it paid for repairs to the family's apartment. But with the $ 630 <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> brought home a month from his janitorial job, `` We ca n't pay them,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Dean </PERSON>, 35. `` Right now we'd be taking food out of our mouths.'' On Tuesday, the <PERSON> Deans </PERSON> learned they would n't have to pay. Fireman's Fund dropped all claims against the family after the media inquiries. Fireman's Fund, which has its headquarters near <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Francisco </LOCATION> and last year had revenues of $ 3.9 billion, is dropping its case against the <PERSON> Deans </PERSON> because `` this is the right thing to do,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kozero </PERSON>, a spokesman for the insurance company. `` This case is special.'' `` This is a nightmare when this sort of thing happens,'' said <PERSON> Kozero </PERSON>, who only recently learned of the case. `` You wonder how things happened to get to this point.'' Others have wondered, too. <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> Butler </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> lawyer and a friend of <PERSON> Suzanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Dean </PERSON>'s mother, waged a telephone war, calling Fireman's Fund executives and alerting <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> reporters. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Jones </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insurance </ORGANIZATION>, said the company had `` no right'' to demand anything from the Deans without a court order. `` We're pleased that Fireman's Fund made a decision that results in a happy ending to a situation that must have been tremendously distressing to this family,'' he said. <PERSON> Kozero </PERSON> said Fireman's Fund employees who handled the claim against the <PERSON> Deans </PERSON> were not fully aware of the family's problems, which included the loss of all their possessions in the fire. But Ms. <PERSON> Butler </PERSON> said she told at least two company employees last week that Mrs. <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> was mentally retarded and that the family was in dire financial condition. `` This has just made my day,'' said <PERSON> Dean </PERSON>, 36. `` I'm relieved. If I'd had to pay them for 32 years, I'd be 68 years old when I was finished.''

<TEXT>
 A coalition of groups opposed to right-wing President <PERSON> Augusto </PERSON> <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> has accused the military of sowing a climate of fear as an excuse to call off or annul a referendum on his rule. The government did not immediately issue a statement reacting to the charge about the balloting, scheduled for next Wednesday. Chileans will vote either `` yes'' or `` no'' on whether to give <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> a new eight-year term as president. A 16-party anti-government coalition said Wednesday it was concerned with government advertisements predicting political violence and social chaos if the `` no'' vote wins. Coalition leader <PERSON> Patricio </PERSON> <PERSON> Aylwin </PERSON> said the coalition is worried `` the government or ultra-rightist groups will ... try to alter the course of the campaign, carrying out last-minute acts of violence to create a pretext for avoiding the plebiscite.'' In the southern city of <LOCATION> Concepcion </LOCATION>, meanwhile, street protests broke out when the president campaigned there. No injuries or arrested were reported. The opposition also said it was confident that should the vote take place the people would reject <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>. Gen. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> and other top officials repeatedly have said they plan to abide by the 1980 consitution, which calls for the referendum as part of a phased transition to elected rule. <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>, 72, the army commander, seized power in a 1973 military coup that toppled elected President <PERSON> Salvador </PERSON> <PERSON> Allende </PERSON>, a Marxist. If a majority votes `` yes'' in the referendum, <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> will assume a new eight-year term next March. If <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> loses, an open election is to be held next year and <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON> would hand power over to the winner in 1990. Most polls give the opposition a substantial lead over Pinochet in the referendum. But in an apparent last-minute effort to sway voters, new government television commercials include images of burned children, bodies in the street and hordes of people attacking innocent women and children. The government's message is that social chaos will occur if the opposition wins. `` We call attention to the possibility that the day of the plebiscite, and facing the imminence of its defeat, the government will try to create a situation that makes the vote invalid,'' said the statement read by <PERSON> Aylwin </PERSON>, president of the centrist <ORGANIZATION> Christian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, at a news conference. On Tuesday, the navy commander, Adm. <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Merino </PERSON>, warned Chilean leftists that `` they are going to hurt a lot'' if they take to the streets the night of the referendum, which he described as a battle between God and Satan. The government maintains that an opposition victory in the referendum would mean communist rule, despite the fact that many moderate groups oppose <PERSON> Pinochet </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Japanese Worry About Decorum for Emperor's Illness
^With PM-Hirohito</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Etiquette-conscious Japanese are unnerved over what to say, how to act, and even what to drink in the face of their emperor's illness. Their unease has produced everything from a forgivable slip of the tongue in a prime minister to a jaw-lowering newspaper editorial expressing grief over Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s death. With the many social changes in the 62 years of <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s reign, the Japanese just do n't seem to know how to deal properly with his illness _ much less his eventual death The <ORGANIZATION> Asahi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shimbun </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s second-largest newspaper, said <ORGANIZATION> Nissan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> had canceled a television commercial with the catch phrase `` Is everybody in good spirits?'' while a <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> car dealership had taken down posters extolling `` The Joy of Living.'' For high-ranking politicians, overseas sojourns have been canceled or postponed and even trips away from <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> have been avoided. Television stations have toned down boisterous programming, marriage ceremonies have been put off and sales put on hold at department stores. However, <ORGANIZATION> Cabinet </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Keizo </PERSON> <PERSON> Obuchi </PERSON> told reporters today that the emperor would be disappointed at a rash of cancellations of sports events and autumn festivals. `` I think the people's consideration for the emperor's early recovery is so precious,'' <PERSON> Obuchi </PERSON> said. `` But it's not favorable if it has a negative effect on social and economic activities. It would disappoint the emperor, who always considers the people.'' The 87-year-old emperor took to bed Sept. 19 after he vomited blood from intestinal hemorrhaging. At first, domestic news media confined themselves mainly to reporting the details of his medical condition. However, reports have now begun to percolate through the taut silence that the emperor, the longest-reigning monarch alive, may have cancer _ itself a taboo subject in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. News organizations have tried to walk a tightrope, demonstrating proper deference to the ailing monarch but saying enough to show their concern. Even leaders schooled in public life have faltered in the confusion. During a meeting with reporters following his first trip to the Imperial Palace since the emperor fell ill, Prime Minister <PERSON> Noboru </PERSON> <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> was clearly unnerved, one news report said. In response to a reporter's question, <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON> committed the social gaffe of using honorifics in reference to himself, the weekly <ORGANIZATION> Shukan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Asahi </ORGANIZATION> magazine reported. Honorifics, part of the Japanese vocabulary used when speaking or referring to people of higher status, have been prominent in newspaper headlines describing the emperor's condition. Though forgivable, the breach of etiquette underscored <PERSON> Takeshita </PERSON>'s _ and the nation's _ discomfort over the emperor's condition On Monday, the English-language <ORGANIZATION> Mainichi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> accidentally published an editorial expressing grief over the emperor's death. The scandalous mistake ended in dismissal of the paper's general manager and demotion of the editor in chief of the whole <ORGANIZATION> Mainichi </ORGANIZATION> group of publications. Some embarrassments have been avoided. In keeping with the restrained national mood, no alcohol was served at a fund-raising party Wednesday night for a junior member of parliament, the mass-circulation <ORGANIZATION> Yomiuri </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shimbun </ORGANIZATION> newspaper reported today. The Japanese have also toiled _ and puzzled _ over contingency plans for the emperor's death. A news report even quoted a manager of one restaurant franchise as saying tiny <LOCATION> Japanese </LOCATION> flags used as decorations for children's lunches would be removed. `` They would be removed because they are flags that ca n't be flown at half-staff,'' the manager reportedly said. A nationwide association of outdoor advertisers, including businesses which produce or regulate the use of neon signs, recently held an emergency meeting to set guidelines, according to the weekly magazine <ORGANIZATION> Aera </ORGANIZATION>. They decided that when the emperor dies, all large neon signs should be turned off until the fourth night afterward. `` It would be terrible if only your shop would stand out,'' said one industry source quoted by the nationally circulated newsmagazine. Not everyone, however, has fretted over doing the wrong thing. The <LOCATION> Akahata </LOCATION> newspaper of the <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> criticized the subdued national mood by publishing comments from readers angered by changes in television schedules. `` I was really mad,'' a 27-year-old housewife was quoted as telling the newspaper. `` My 6 - and 7-year-old children started crying in front of the TV set after waiting for a cartoon show to begin.

 The dollar inched up against the Japanese yen Thursday, while share prices lost ground on the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. The dollar closed at 134.35 yen, up 0.15 yen from Wednesday's finish It ranged mainly between 133.85 yen and 134.50 yen after opening the day at 133.98 yen. The Nikkei Stock Average of 225 selected issues, a 252.45-point winner Wednesday, lost 51.88 points, or 0.17 percent, to finish at 27,700.13 points. A report that Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> had left a <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> meeting for the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> sharply increased the dollar-buying drive, said a dealer with the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION>, speaking on condition of anonymity. He said investors who speculated the departure could indicate the administration of <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> might be getting weaker started selling the yen to buy more dollars, helping to push the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency higher. The report alleging a secret meeting in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> also affected the stock market, said an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Nomura </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s largest brokerage. `` Although the market has been doing well for the last couple of days, such news immediately made investors cautious and affected their trading,'' said the <ORGANIZATION> Nomura </ORGANIZATION> analyst, speaking on condition of anonymity.

<HEAD>Discovery's Primary Task To Deploy $100 Million Satellite</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By LAURA TOLLEY</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>SPACE CENTER, Houston (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The $ 100 million satellite to be deployed today from shuttle Discovery will nearly double the time ground controllers can talk to astronauts as they orbit Earth. Aside from proving shuttles can fly again, deploying the Tracking and Data Relay Satellite is Discovery's main mission. One is already in orbit, but a nearly identical one was destroyed in the Challenger explosion Jan. 28, 1986. The satellite, once it reaches it final orbit of 22,300 miles, will help ground controllers monitor shuttles and unmanned spacecraft. Coverage provided by the satellite is more continuous than the space agency's worldwide network of ground-based communications tracking systems. Deploying the satellite is important to <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> because the one in orbit has had minor breakdowns and is operating at about 98 percent capacity, said <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON>, a spokesman at the agency's <ORGANIZATION> Goddard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flight </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Greenbelt </LOCATION>, Md. That satellite can monitor shuttles about 45 percent of each orbit. A satellite relays signals and data between a spacecraft or another satellite and a ground terminal at White Sands Missile Range, <LOCATION> N.M. </LOCATION>, which then routes it to the appropriate <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> facility. The deployment is scheduled to begin about six hours after liftoff, although there were five later times it could be done if needed. A spring-loaded ejection device first pushes the satellite and an Inertial Upper Stage booster rocket from Discovery's cargo bay, and the satellite waltzes away at 2.7 mph. About an hour later, the rocket's first stage fires. The second stage ignites 12 -LCB- hours after launch and puts the satellite in its final orbit. The satellite and booster and its carrying cradle weigh about 45,000 pounds, making it the heaviest payload to be carried aboard a shuttle, <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> officials said. The satellite itself weighs about 5,000 pounds and it has two 50-pound antennas that look like giant umbrellas. The satellite will be placed in orbit over the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> near the <LOCATION> Gilbert </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>. Its orbit keeps it always hovering over the same part of the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>. On Tuesday, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> had a brief scare when a booster rocket being readied for a shuttle flight next February was found to have a damaged seal. There was concern that the booster rocket aboard Discovery might have the same flaw, but engineers worked overnight and determined from tests that even with such a defect, the seal would perform properly.

 Republican <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was turning to debate preparations today after a campaign swing intended to end doubts about how much support he had from <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. From the moment <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> gave <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> words of praise and a reassuring fatherly pat at a <LOCATION> Jackson </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, rally on Monday, the process of establishing <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s campaign credentials was under way. The 41-year-old <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> senator debates his Democratic counterpart and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> colleague, <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, Wednesday in <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Neb </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Top </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> strategists stalked reporters on <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s campaign plane as the <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> senator made his first foray into <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, the state where <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> was born and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had made his home. Their message: <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> has <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s confidence despite controversies over his past military service, academic record and personal life, not to mention polls showing many voters have doubts about his qualifications. They claimed <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> is doing all a vice presidential candidate could to help out the ticket. <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> <PERSON> Bond </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s deputy campaign manager and political director, said that with the completion Wednesday of <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> swing, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> has campaigned in 35 states, nine of them targeted by the campaign as important swing states. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s role has been to campaign in safe Republican areas, hold the party's base for November and get good local media coverage. `` Remember the perspective of what a vice presidential nominee traditionally does _ hold your base and help out target states,'' <PERSON> Bond </PERSON> said. In the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> cities <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> visited this week, he got front-page headlines and often color photographs. Although there have been reports that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has tried to distance himself from <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> because of the negative publicity surrounding him, aides said that was not a factor in Monday's joint appearance being the ticket's first since Aug. 20. `` Presidential and vice presidential candidates do n't spend a lot of time together on the road,'' <PERSON> Bond </PERSON> said. `` That is no reflection on <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s standing with us.'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s mission in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, with its 29 electoral votes, was to raise money and go after <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> was largely ignored. In fact, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> never mentioned him publicly by name. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> continued the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> strategy of portraying <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as an unrepentant liberal, out of touch with mainstream views. On Tuesday, he called on <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> to resign his membership in the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>. On Wednesday, he blasted <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for being on the advisory board of a group which advocated deep defense cuts and which has among its supporters `` the extreme left wing of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>.'' The highly partisan crowds jeered.

 Saying `` I am not a liar and I am not crazy,'' a black teen-ager who claims she was abducted and raped by whites rejected the reported conclusion of a grand jury that she fabricated her harrowing tale. `` I have not deceived my advisers, my family and most of all, my people,'' <PERSON> Tawana </PERSON> <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> said at a news conference Wednesday in her first public comment on the case, which sparked allegations of a racially motivated cover-up. After she read her statement, <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON>, 16, declined to answer questions about November's incident. `` I am not a liar and I am not crazy. I just want justice and I then want to be left alone,'' said <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON>, who recently moved with her mother and her mother's boyfriend from <LOCATION> Wappingers </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, to <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va </LOCATION>. Poised as she gave the five-minute statement, her voice only began to quaver toward the end. `` I will give full testimony to an impartial grand jury _ an impartial grand jury _ or a congressional committee,'' said <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON>, who so far has refused to testify. `` I wish to thank God for saving my life,'' she said of the incident. `` He holds my hand and He let me live to stop the cover-up once and for all.'' Earlier Wednesday, her advisers _ the Rev. <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharpton </PERSON> and lawyers <PERSON> Alton </PERSON> <PERSON> Maddox </PERSON> and <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vernon </PERSON> <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> _ asserted that <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> state Attorney General <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> Gov. <PERSON> Mario </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuomo </PERSON> had illegally leaked the grand jury findings to <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, which published the panel's conclusions Tuesday. During an interview on <ORGANIZATION> WLIB </ORGANIZATION>, a black-oriented radio station in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Sharpton </PERSON> said the three black activists would lead a protest in <LOCATION> Brooklyn </LOCATION> this afternoon to `` make the whole city stand still.'' At the news conference, <PERSON> Sharpton </PERSON> challenged the grand jury and the <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> to `` give us one name of one witness that can establish that this was a hoax.'' <PERSON> Mason </PERSON> challenged <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Rudolph </PERSON> <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> to `` debate the racist system.'' In a statement, <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON> said: `` These people have proven by their irresponsible words and actions that they can not be taken seriously. It would be inappropriate to dignify anything they say with a response.'' <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilles </PERSON>, a spokesman for the attorney general, said, `` <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> did not leak the grand jury materials to the Times and he has asked the state's special corruption prosecutor, <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Hynes </PERSON>, to investigate who did.'' <PERSON> Gilles </PERSON> said he could not comment on when the panel's report would be released. Miss <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON>'s mother, <PERSON> Glenda </PERSON>, and boyfriend <PERSON> Ralph </PERSON> <PERSON> King </PERSON> were at the news conference but did not speak. Had she returned to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, Mrs. <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> faced 30 days in jail for defying a subpoena to testify in the grand jury investigation of her daughter's claims. According to the Times, the grand jury speculated that Miss <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> fabricated the tale because she feared King would punish her for staying out late, and that drugs and her relationships with shady characters may have played a role. The grand jury, which has been directed by <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON>, the special prosecutor in the case, will issue no indictments, the Times reported. The panel is not permitted to criticize ordinary citizens it does not indict. Miss <PERSON> Brawley </PERSON> was found Nov. 28 inside a garbage bag near an apartment her family once occupied in <LOCATION> Wappingers </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Falls </LOCATION>. She was smeared with dog feces, seemingly dazed and with racial slurs scrawled on her body. Evidence led the grand jury to conclude she was not abducted Nov. 24 as she claimed, but stayed at least part of the time in the vacant apartment.

 The dollar inched up against the Japanese yen today, and share prices closed lower on the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. The dollar finished at 134.35 yen, up 0.15 yen from Wednesday's close of 134.20 yen After opening lower at 133.98 yen, the currency rose and traded between 133.85 yen and 134.50 yen. The dollar-buying trend in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> began after dealers heard that Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> left a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> meeting in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> late Wednesday for a secret session in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, said a dealer with the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION>, speaking on condition of anonymity.

 The story of <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Robeson </PERSON> may be too large, too full of life to fit comfortably on stage but playwright <PERSON> Phillip </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON> <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> shoehorns most of the biographical facts into his drama about the famous black athlete, actor, singer and political activist. Dean supplies the facts, and actor <PERSON> Avery </PERSON> <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON>, best known as <PERSON> Hawk </PERSON> on TV's `` Spenser: For Hire,'' supplies the spirit for `` <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Robeson </PERSON>,'' which opened Wednesday at Broadway's Golden Theater. <PERSON> Brooks </PERSON> is an impressive performer, a fine singer as well as a compelling actor. He needs both skills for this marathon portrait that has him on stage for more than 2 -LCB- hours. <PERSON> Robeson </PERSON>'s life is told simply and straightforwardly by the actor himself. <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> sets out the story as if he were presenting a resume. Fortunately, there are enough interesting events, even in <PERSON> Robeson </PERSON>'s early life, to make it palatable The play details the college career at <ORGANIZATION> Rutgers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> where, in addition to being named Phi Beta Kappa, <PERSON> Robeson </PERSON> was a member of the glee club, debating team and an extraordinary football player.

<HEAD>Magnetic-Levitation Transport Should Run Along Interstates,
Researchers Say</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 High-speed magnetic-levitation transportation systems whose cars would appear to float on air could be installed along interstate highway routes, cutting pollution and saving millions of barrels of oil a year, scientists say. `` Much of the system is very straight and contains adequate space for both the existing highways and for vehicle guideways, suitably isolated for mutual safety,'' <PERSON> Gordon </PERSON> <PERSON> Danby </PERSON>, a senior physicist at <ORGANIZATION> Brookhaven </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratory </ORGANIZATION>, told a congressional panel Wednesday. `` This interstate approach overcomes the greatest cost and availability impediment: obtaining guideway real estate.'' `` Guideways'' are the magnetic tracks along which magnetic-levitation cars run. The system works on the simple principle that like magnetic poles repel each other. Cars glide along, propelled by a traveling magnetic field. <PERSON> Danby </PERSON> and <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Powell </PERSON>, a nuclear engineer at <LOCATION> Brookhaven </LOCATION>, have agreed to head an advisory group that will study the application of magnetic-levitation transportation to the interstate highway system. Sen. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Moynihan </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, chairman of the Environment subcommittee on water resources, transportation and infrastructure, said the advisory panel is slated to complete its work by February 1989 and that he will present its findings to the next president. <PERSON> Powell </PERSON> testified that if a `` mag-lev'' train running along the <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> Expressway carried 150,000 passengers a day, it could save 8 million barrels of oil a year, while cutting air pollution and saving wear on family cars. `` If mag-lev were to be applied on a nationwide basis, its total benefits would be hundreds of times greater than sketched for the <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION> application,'' he said. <PERSON> Danby </PERSON> also predicted that while mag-lev transport will not replace the automobile or truck, it has a definite edge over conventional trains. `` The mag-lev system is much faster and more energy-efficient, providing potential for mobility much greater than previously known,'' he said. `` Long trips in short time can become routine.'' But <PERSON> Danby </PERSON> warned against buying existing mag-lev systems from the Japanese and Germans, who quickly took to the American-invented concept and made it reality. `` The existing mag-lev systems are first embodiments,'' he said. `` In the future, these will appear as dated as early automobiles or airplanes.'' He said the advisory panel will consider ways in which a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> system could be financed. `` Options involving partnerships between public and private sectors appear particularly interesting,'' he said.

 Using a technique to make millions of copies of a tiny bit of genetic material, scientists have performed genetic analysis on individual sperm and single body cells, says a report published today. Sperm analysis should help the search for disease-causing genes, while single-cell studies might allow diagnosis of genetic diseases in an embryo soon after test-tube fertilization, researchers said. The early diagnosis would allow a decision on whether to implant the embryo in the mother, researcher <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Arnheim </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Southern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> in </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> said Wednesday in a telephone interview. Sperm analysis should also help police implicate or exclude rape suspects, he said. <PERSON> Arnheim </PERSON> and graduate student <PERSON> Honghua </PERSON> <PERSON> Li </PERSON> report the work with other scientists at the university and <ORGANIZATION> Cetus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Emeryville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, in today's issue of the British journal Nature. They used a technique called polymerase chain reaction that creates millions of copies of a minute amount of genetic material, accumulating enough for genetic analysis. In one series of experiments, they were able to detect which of two variants of a gene was present in 43 of 80 sperm analyzed. In another series, they were able to identify variants in two genes simultaneously in 70 of 114 sperm analyzed. Such analysis should help scientists find disease-causing genes, <PERSON> Arnheim </PERSON> said. Genes lie along string-like structures called chromosomes. To find particular genes, scientists use markers, which are bits of genetic material at known locations along the same chromosome as the gene they are seeking. They close in on the gene by discovering closer and closer markers. When scientists have to determine the order in which markers lie along a chromosome, they must study chromosomes from many members of a family. But sperm from an individual can provide a far larger number of appropriate chromosomes for analysis, letting scientists find the order of very closely spaced markers, <PERSON> Arnheim </PERSON> said.

 A former aide to Sen. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Metzenbaum </PERSON> has been indicted on charges of accepting bribes from two <LOCATION> Polish </LOCATION> immigrants, but the senator, who faces re-election in November, questioned the indictment's timing. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> McLaughlin </PERSON> said Wednesday that <PERSON> Ladd </PERSON> <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> was indicted by a special federal grand jury for agreeing to accept $ 2,000 from <PERSON> Waclaw </PERSON> <PERSON> Pietrzykowsky </PERSON> for helping him get a friend admitted to the <ORGANIZATION> Ohio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Veterinary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medicine </ORGANIZATION>.

Why has it taken the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> almost a year to seek the indictment is a question that remains to be answered.'' <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON>, a spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Cleveland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> office, said the timing of the prosecution was up to the Criminal Division of the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>. `` The <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> expeditiously went about their investigation,'' <PERSON> Sullivan </PERSON> said. `` The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney's office and the Criminal Division of the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> _ it's their responsibility to proceed when they decide.'' A <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman could not be reached for comment Wednesday night. <PERSON> Harris </PERSON> said he completed interviews with constituents on Nov. 20, 1986, that indicated <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> may have accepted payments. `` A woman from <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION> came in and told one of our case workers that <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> was one of a group of people who asked for money.

 Protesters yelling anti-Olympic slogans hurled hundreds of firebombs at riot police today as radical students vowed to disrupt the Summer Games if a student leader is not released. About 1,000 students clashed with police around <ORGANIZATION> Korea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in the worst street clash in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> since the Games began Sept. 17. The protest marked the second straight day of demonstrations calling for the release of student leader Oh Young-shik, arrested by police last week. Waves of students pelted police with rocks and firebombs, setting some troopers ablaze. Police tried to fend off the missiles with shields during the hour-long clash. `` Down with the dictators' Olympics,'' and `` Yankee go home,'' radicals yelled as they charged lines of riot police blocking the streets with shields. Police martial arts squads with long batons charged the students, beating and kicking some protesters. But police were pushed back several times by counter-attacking students. Some police and students were injured by firebombs and rocks, but police had no casualty figures. There were no reports of arrests. The fighting was confined to the streets in front of the school in northeastern <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, about 15 miles from where the Games are being held. Students from other <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> colleges took part. Firemen called in by police tried to douse exploding firebombs with hoses, but students drove them off with more missiles. Police were hampered in the fighting because of a government ban on using tear gas during the Olympics to try and preserve peace. The police hurled stones and rocks, but had no effective way of fighting back without tear gas. Police tried to avoid a clash, staying in backstreets while the students blocked the main road and tore down part of the school's walls Students attacked with firebombs as soon as police moved in. Radicals said they would disrupt the Olympics, including the mens' marathon on Sunday, if police do not release Oh. The student leader was charged Tuesday with violating national security laws for organizing anti-government demonstrations. Authorities have beefed up security for Olympic events in case of student demonstrations and say the radicals wo n't be able to disrupt any events. Radical leaders released a statement charging the government of popularly elected President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> <PERSON> Tae-woo </PERSON> is using the Olympics to `` cement dictatorship.'' Students protesting against the government have staged anti-Olympic protests to demand the Games be shared with communist <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and to denounce the <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> administration. But just a handful of students have turned out for the mostly peaceful protests. Most South Koreans want the Games to be a major success and are critical of the radicals. <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> is boycotting the Olympics because its demand to co-host the Games was rejected by the International Olympic Committee. The committee said the Games are awarded to a single city and could not be shared.

 Court papers seeking to dismiss a drug indictment against <LOCATION> Panamanian </LOCATION> leader <PERSON> Manuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> did not include references to Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> or his presidential campaign as prosecutors had feared. The 65-page motion, which characterizes the case against the Panamanian general as a political ploy, was unsealed Wednesday after the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's office found it contained none of the possible blackmail they believed <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> might use to bargain with the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration. `` My concern was that they would use it as some sort of political leverage, but they did n't,'' said <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Gregorie </PERSON>, chief deputy assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney. `` I do n't think there is anything in there that is shocking.'' <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> had previously claimed he had information that could hurt the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign. Instead, the motion argues that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government has no right to prosecute <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> as a de facto head of state with diplomatic immunity. It also says he has been targeted for political reasons and that pretrial publicity will make it impossible to find an objective jury. `` Whatever information damaging to <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> that may exist, that information was not going to be raised in our motion unless it was relevant to the case,'' said <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON>'s attorney, <PERSON> Neal </PERSON> <PERSON> Sonnett </PERSON>. The 12-count indictment returned by a federal grand jury in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> in February accused <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> of accepting $ 4.6 million in bribes from <LOCATION> Colombia </LOCATION>'s violent <LOCATION> Medellin </LOCATION> drug cartel. A grand jury in <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> indicted <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> on three marijuana importation counts the next day. The motion filed in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> and sealed on Sept. 14 claims the indictment was `` based upon impermissible considerations, including political and foreign policy considerations.'' <PERSON> Sonnett </PERSON> said one foreign policy issue was pressure by conservatives in the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration to renegotiate the <ORGANIZATION> Panama </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Treaty </ORGANIZATION>, which was signed by President <PERSON> Carter </PERSON> and hands full control of the waterway to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> at the end of this century. `` There were attempts to modify aspects of the treaty,'' <PERSON> Sonnett </PERSON> said. `` We argue that it was one of the circumstances leading up to a decision to attempt to get <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> out of power.'' The document contains quotes from the news media made by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration officials, such as Undersecretary of State <PERSON> Elliot </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON>, that the defense says demonstrate the political nature of the case. <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON>, for example, is quoted as saying in May that `` the indictment drove <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> crazy and gave us a terrific bargaining tool.'' The defense, calling the case against <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> `` indictment diplomacy,'' notes that in March the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration offered to guarantee it would not seek his extradition if he fled to <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> and in May offered to drop the indictments altogether if he left <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION>. `` There can be no doubt ... that General <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> has been singled out for prosecution'' for political reasons, the attorneys said. The defense motion also argues that <PERSON> Noriega </PERSON> is the first head of state ever indicted in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for action taken within his own country. Although Turks and <LOCATION> Caicos </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> Prime Minister <PERSON> Norman </PERSON> <PERSON> Saunders </PERSON> was convicted in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> in 1985 on drug trafficking charges, the defense notes that his activities took place here. And the attorneys say the group of islands he led is not a sovereign nation but a British colony, making <PERSON> Saunders </PERSON> only a local elected official. <PERSON> Saunders </PERSON> served two years of an eight-year prison term.

 A quarrel over batteries for a portable radio led to the <LOCATION> Outback </LOCATION> shooting deaths of a famed aboriginal bark painter and five members of his family, police said today. Police said their prime suspect was the artist's son-in-law, whose wife was among the victims, and that an extensive search by air and with aboriginal trackers was under way for him in remote Arnhem Land of the Northern Territory. Detective Superintendent <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Darwin </LOCATION> police said several members of painter <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Ngielu </PERSON>'s family survived the massacre and found help on Tuesday. They told police that <PERSON> Ngielu </PERSON>'s son-in-law was angry because there were no batteries for the family radio. He also had a fight with his wife, <PERSON> Cecelia </PERSON>, over the sale of some bark pictures for $ 160, arguing she should have given the money to her father and not spent it, <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> said. He said the son-law was aged 22, but did not identify him. The family, according to eyewitnesses, was shot to death at close range with a 12-gauge shotgun. Also killed was <PERSON> Ngielu </PERSON>'s wife, <PERSON> Dolly </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Cecelia </PERSON>'s two sons, aged two and four.

<HEAD>Study Suggests Gene Transplant Approach for Treating AIDS</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Mouse cells given a gene that stymies a herpes virus resisted the spread of a herpes infection, suggesting that gene transplants in people might help treat AIDS infections, scientists said today. The idea gained support from a Nobel Prize-winning researcher, but a gene transplant expert says the strategy has failed to show promise so far in other experiments. The new work, done in test tubes, was reported in today's issue of the British journal Nature by scientists at the <ORGANIZATION> Carnegie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institution </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Although researchers would face major hurdles in developing the technique to fight AIDS, `` it's a very good thing for them to think about,'' said study co-author <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> McKnight </PERSON>. His experiments dealt with the herpes simplex virus type 1, which causes cold sores and fever blisters in people. Researchers focused on a virus protein called VP16, which the virus needs to activate some of its genes and complete its reproductive cycle. The virus makes the protein under instructions from a gene. Researchers isolated that gene and altered it so that it would give instructions for a defective form of the protein. Then they planted the gene into mouse cells in such a way that the cells and their progeny produced a defective form of VP16. The idea was that after the virus entered a cell and tried to reproduce, the defective VP16 would elbow out the virus's own version. That would block reproduction, preventing any progeny from infecting more cells. Results showed that 24 hours after infection with the herpes virus, a group of cells with the implanted gene had 40 times less virus than a group of normal infected cells did. A similar approach might fight infection by the virus that causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome, researchers wrote. The procedure would involve removing bone marrow, inserting the gene in the `` stem'' cells that produce the body's blood cells, and putting the altered cells back in the person, <PERSON> McKnight </PERSON> said. The gene may then be passed on to blood cells, which are targets for the AIDS virus. It is too early to know if such an approach would work, <PERSON> McKnight </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. Among the questions it raises are how to design and insert the protective gene, and whether the gene would make the blood cells perform abnormally. In a Nature editorial, Nobel laureate <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Baltimore </PERSON> said he believes the strategy `` has as good a chance as any other procedure of becoming a real AIDS therapy'' for infected people, despite formidable obstacles in developing it. With the new results, it is realistic to try animal experiments and work with the AIDS virus, wrote <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Whitehead </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Cambridge </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass </LOCATION>. But in an interview, gene transplant researcher W. French <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institutes </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> said other scientists are investigating gene transplants for AIDS, and `` there is n't anything yet that could even be called promising. <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said scientists have not yet found a way to make transplanted genes perform well in animals in general. Nor have they learned to insert genes into brain cells, which the AIDS virus also infects, he said. No gene transplant research involving AIDS has shown enough promise to try animal experiments, <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> said.

All those convicted face up to 10 years in prison. `` This is n't just a wildlife case; this is a money case,'' Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Gelber </PERSON> said in closing arguments. `` According to the information we have recieved, the parrot carries a price tag of $ 3,000, the macaw $ 2,500. ... They were going to make a lot of money.'' Three defendants were convicted of two counts each of violating the Lacey Act, which regulates the movement of endangered species, and one count each of conspiring. The fourth was convicted only on the violations. The five were arrested on a boat off the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Keys </LOCATION> in April. Six of the 243 confiscated birds, including the macaw, a Cuban <ORGANIZATION> Amazon </ORGANIZATION> parrot, a pair of melodious finches and a mustached parakeet, were brought into court as evidence. Although the birds were taken to the <ORGANIZATION> Metro </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Zoo </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, only 42 of the 193 melodious finches survived. Two of the 48 parrots later died of a parasite infection. The defendants claimed they were transporting the animals from <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> to the Keys when they had engine trouble and radioed the <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> for help. `` It is not my responsibility to prove where the birds came from,'' said defense attorney <PERSON> Ellis </PERSON> <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON>. `` It's the government's responsibility, and they have not done so. <PERSON> Rubin </PERSON> said he would appeal. On Tuesday, two defendants who were free on bond in the bird case were arrested as they left the courtroom. <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON>, 27, was indicted for unlawful possession of a machine gun, and <PERSON> Rigoberto </PERSON> <PERSON> Cherta </PERSON> <PERSON> Garcia </PERSON>, 42, was accused of marijuana conspiracy. Both were convicted in the bird case Wednesday. The other convicted defendants were <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON>, 50, and <PERSON> Jose </PERSON> <PERSON> Flores </PERSON>, 24. <PERSON> Felix </PERSON> <PERSON> Valdes </PERSON>, 39, was acquitted.

<HEAD>Study Suggesting Tiny Comet-Like Objects Flawed by Error,
Scientist Says</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A clerical error marred a key calculation in a study suggesting that unseen comet-like objects are traveling near <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>'s orbit, says a scientist who admits, `` I blew it.'' But the objects may still exist, said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Donahue </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Michigan </ORGANIZATION> at <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Arbor </PERSON>. <PERSON> Donahue </PERSON> was one of three authors who published the study last December in the British journal Nature. They suggested the small objects, called `` cometesimals,'' may strike Earth every 80 years, and may be responsible for many craters on the moon. The cometesimals, ranging in diameter from a few yards to a few tens of yards, may also be building blocks of ordinary comets, the researchers wrote. But the objects may not throw off much dust, making them hard to spot from <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>, they said. The work was based on what appeared to be a higher amount of hydrogen atoms between the orbital paths of <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> and Mars than could be attributed to known causes. Cometesimals were proposed as a possible source. In today's issue of Nature, however, <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Arizona </ORGANIZATION> researchers said their re-analysis of the same data from the Voyager 2 spacecraft showed no inexplicable excess of hydrogen atoms. In a telephone interview, <PERSON> Donahue </PERSON> said the mistake in the original paper occurred because a student misread a number from a table of data. That caused a crucial calculation to underestimate the amount of hydrogen that a theory predicts would be found in outer space. The underestimate created the gap that was explained by the cometesimal proposal. `` I do n't even want to blame the student. I should have checked,'' <PERSON> Donahue </PERSON> said. `` I blew it, that's all.'' He said estimates of the expected concentration of hydrogen in outer space are not firm, and that revised figures still leave some room for the existence of cometesimals. Observations by the <ORGANIZATION> Galileo </ORGANIZATION> spacecraft, which is scheduled to be launched next year, should reveal whether they exist, he said.

<HEAD>Second Pill Said Effective in Terminating Early Pregnancies</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An abortion pill able to safely end early pregnancies, much like a pill recently approved for use in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, has been successfully tested by Dutch scientists. The latest medicine, called epostane, worked in 84 percent of women who used it in the fifth through eighth weeks of pregnancy, researchers reported today. Dr. <PERSON> Marinus </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Crooij </PERSON> and colleagues from <PERSON> Elisabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Gasthuis </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Haarlem </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, gave the drug to 50 women who were planning to have abortions. They reported their results in today's New England Journal of Medicine. `` We conclude that epostane taken orally is an effective and safe method for the non-invasive termination of undesired early pregnancy,'' they wrote. The researchers speculated that using epostane with RU 486 might be more effective than either alone. Tests showed RU 486 or mifepristone, which was approved earlier this month for use in <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, was 95 percent effective. Neither drug is available in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, where anti-abortion activists have threatened to boycott products of any drug company that produces such a pill. Both drugs work by interferring with progesterone, a hormone essential during the first weeks of pregnancy for the implantation of a fertilized egg on the uterine wall. Proponents of such pills consider them a simpler, safer alternative to traditional abortions. Opponents, including the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, say they are just another way to kill the unborn. With the new pills, there is no surgical act. No anesthesia is needed and there is no risk of infection, sterility or of perforating the uterus, but RU 486 research has turned up hemorrhaging in a small percentage of users.

 Reports that <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has scaled back expectations in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> and West have prompted his rival's campaign to claim the regions for <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> A <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> aide dismissed this as `` a Republican fantasy'' and said Democrats have actually bolstered their staffing in the South. Top campaign aides to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said the vice president has a lock on the South and the <LOCATION> Rocky </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> region, leaving him free to compete with the Democratic presidential nominee in a handful of key states. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign manager <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> and political director <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> <PERSON> Bond </PERSON>, in a telephone news conference Wednesday with <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> reporters, said they are delighted with comments by anonymous <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign officials who say they have scaled back expectations in those two regions. But <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign spokesman <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Gearan </PERSON> said it was `` a Republican fantasy that we would pull out of the South.'' `` <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> has been saying this for some time hoping it would come true,'' he said. `` It will not. We have more people working in the South today than this time last week.'' <PERSON> Gearan </PERSON> said recent polls have shown <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> competitive with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> across the South. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> aides have said privately in recent days they intend to compete vigorously in several key states while scaling back the campaign elsewhere. `` It's interesting to see a Dukakis 50-state strategy come to an abrupt halt,'' <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> said. The two <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> strategists said the vice president is banking on a solid block of support across the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Rocky </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> states and will focus his campaign on nine key states: <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bond </PERSON> said the states <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> counts as solidly behind his campaign account for 200 of the 270 electoral votes needed to win on Nov. 8. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, according to <PERSON> Bond </PERSON>, can count on only 170 electoral votes. `` We need to win only two or three of those -LRB- nine -RRB- states while <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> would have to win five to seven depending on whether <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> was among that group,'' <PERSON> Bond </PERSON> said. `` So we can concentrate on fewer states,'' <PERSON> Bond </PERSON> said. `` We're going to be concentrating on <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> and states like that and we can feel that the southern and <LOCATION> Rocky </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountain </LOCATION> states are intact,'' <PERSON> Bond </PERSON> said. Conservative to centrist voters in the key states would disagree with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' opposition to the death penalty, his past policy of furloughs for first-degree murderers, his membership in the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> and his veto of a bill that would have required teachers to lead their classes in the Pledge of Allegiance, <PERSON> Atwater </PERSON> said. A survey of campaign trips over the past two months published Wednesday by The Patriot Ledger of <LOCATION> Quincy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, indicates that if appearances by the candidate are any indication, neither <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> nor <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is running a 50-state campaign. The survey listed 20 states that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has not yet visited and 26 states where <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has yet to make an appearance. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> topped the travel lists of both candidates for obvious reasons. <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> carries the most electoral votes with 47, while <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> carries 29. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has spent all or part of eight days in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> since accepting the Democratic nomination July 21 while <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has spent six days there. Those numbers were reversed in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>.

 The sounds of chain saws and combines are part of the country music, as thousands of farmers journey to a 1,400-acre stretch of northern <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> for an agricultural exposition billed as the world's largest. `` My fear was that they would be in a real down mood because of the drought and poor yields, but they seem to be optimistic,'' said <PERSON> Don </PERSON> <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON>, one of the 340 commercial exhibitors at the event, which wraps up tonight. For <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON> and other exhibitors, the idea is to attract the attention of an estimated 200,000 farmers from as near as <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION> and as far as <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. They do it with displays like balloons, wagons stacked five high, sculptors carving with chain saws, and antique tractors. `` We're here to show them our products and, hopefully, write orders,'' said <PERSON> Nichols </PERSON>, a salesman for <ORGANIZATION> J. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> M. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Schultz </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. As farmers stroll away from the 60-acre midway, they are surrounded by test plots with 400 varieties of corn and 260 varieties of soybeans, as well as information on herbicides, new machinery, and farming tips `` I come here to get ideas,'' said <PERSON> Lowell </PERSON> <PERSON> McCollough </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Bourbon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ind. </LOCATION>, who farms 276 acres and carried a plastic bag full of product brochures and microwave popcorn samples. One insurance company offers a bingo game to entertain visitors, while a university offers advice and testing on the impact of agricultural noise on farmers' hearing. Some show visitors gathered to welcome Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> when he visited the area Wednesday, while barkers from the food tents strolled the exhibit area soliciting customers. `` If you eat at Tent 5, it'll keep you alive,'' said <PERSON> Alberta </PERSON> <PERSON> Strasser </PERSON> of nearby <LOCATION> Creston </LOCATION>, wearing a red-and-white clown suit and a black hat with a yellow flower. `` There is a lot of competition _ there are five food tents. But, business is tremendous,'' she said. At one of the exhibits, <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Bretthauer </PERSON> put on his goggles and guided his chain saw into the wood, turning a rough log into a carved bear as a crowd gathered to watch. `` The idea is to stop them as they walk by, and the carving is the big crowd-pleaser,'' said <PERSON> Bretthauer </PERSON>, a chain saw salesman from <LOCATION> Tonganoxie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION> `` It's well worth being at this shows _ our sales in the state always go up 15 percent.'' Carving the wood is not as easy as some people think, and cutting even a simple square can be tricky. `` You start off to make a bear,'' <PERSON> Bretthauer </PERSON> said. `` You cut the nose too short, so you do a coyote. My first carvings became firewood.'' Manager <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Budd </PERSON> said the farm show began as a one-day event in 1953, and expanded to a three-day show in 1960. It moves from <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Iowa </LOCATION>, sponsored by Prairie Farmer Magazine. `` We wanted to bring advertisers and farmers together to see the latest advances in science and technology, and see machinery operate under normal field conditions,'' <PERSON> Budd </PERSON> said. `` The idea clicked.'' The show is held on the land of five families who farm around this <LOCATION> Lee </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> community, about 75 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>. `` At first, we did n't know if we wanted to get involved,'' said <PERSON> Duane </PERSON> <PERSON> Ackland </PERSON>, one of the host farmers. `` But, it benefits the community, and it makes you feel good to do something for the future.''

<HEAD>High Court Upholds Death Sentence For White Killer of Black</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BLOEMFONTEIN, South Africa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The country's highest court today upheld the death sentence of a white man convicted of killing a black policeman and trying to make the slaying look like the work of black radicals. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Burt </PERSON>, 35, faces hanging unless President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> commutes the sentence. No execution date was announced. <PERSON> Burt </PERSON> was convicted last year of beating Sgt. <PERSON> Johannes </PERSON> <PERSON> Ndimande </PERSON> into unconsciousness in June 1986, placing a gasoline-soaked tire around his neck, and setting it on fire. No clear motive was established in the trial. That method of killing is called `` necklacing.'' The government says scores of blacks were `` necklaced'' from 1984 through 1987 by black radicals who suspected them of collaborating with white authorities. <PERSON> Burt </PERSON>, a former soldier who worked for the state-run <ORGANIZATION> Nuclear </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, pleaded innocent at his trial, though he said he gave the policeman a lift that night. Part of <PERSON> Burt </PERSON>'s defense was that he attended a meeting before the killing at which white residents complained about rising black crime. But the <ORGANIZATION> Appeal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> rejected that defense in today's ruling.

<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> <PERSON> Tae-woo </PERSON> said today that the news media of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> should show restraint and avoid reports that may provoke the sentiments of their people. <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> made the remarks after receiving a briefing on growing anti-U.S. sentiment in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> during the Olympics now under way in <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>. `` The news media of the two countries now should report in a way not to provoke the sentiments of each other's people,'' <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> said during a visit to the main Olympic press center. The president commented on a raging controversy involving the <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION>, saying the American television network's reports of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> were `` mostly affirmative.'' `` Even if the reports of <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> included something that hurt our self-esteem, we should put up with it, since most of the network's reorts were affimative,'' he said <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> has been a target of South Korean criticism because of its extensive coverage of South Korean boxing officials' assault on a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Zealand </LOCATION> referee after one of their Olympic boxers lost a close decision last week. The allegedly `` biased'' coverage of <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> and incidents involving American athletes, including the arrests of two <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> gold medalist swimmers after a mask was taken from a hotel, touched off a new wave of anti-American sentiments. Prime Minister <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Hyun-jae </PERSON> also took up the issue today and said, `` We should not let one-time feelings damage the traditionally friendly relations between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and our nation.'' Governing and opposition politicians also expressed concern about rising anti-U.S. and pro-Soviet sentiment in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> and warned that the trend could hurt <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION>'s national interest. South Koreans enthusiastically backed the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in its victorious semifinal basketball match with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> on Wednesday.

<HEAD>Dollar Generally Higher In Listless Trading, Gold Also Rises</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The dollar was slightly higher against most currencies in listless European trading this morning but dealers said its rise had been capped by Monday's round of central bank intervention. Gold bullion prices were also higher in choppy trading. Foreign exchange dealers said that despite the central bank intervention, market sentiment still favored a higher dollar. The <ORGANIZATION> Deutsche </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bundesbank </ORGANIZATION>, the West German central bank, was rumored to have asked for dollar rates in the foreign exchange market early in the day, but dealers said they do n't expect an intervention as long as trading is calm. A dealer at a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> bank in <LOCATION> Frankfurt </LOCATION> said the dollar was being supported by concern over the political trend in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, where party leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> is facing a key test in a party meeting this week. `` There is nothing coming out of -LRB- the joint annual meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> in -RRB- <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>, so people are focusing a bit on these political events,'' he said.

<HEAD>Government Claims Civil Servants Back At Work</HEAD>

<DATELINE>RANGOON, Burma (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The military government claims more than half the personnel at five ministries in <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> have quit a pro-democracy general strike, but a <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> diplomat said today that the workers only planned to pick up their paychecks. A general strike that began Aug. 8 has become the most effective form of protest since Gen. Saw <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> staged a coup Sept. 18 and brutally suprressed the daily anti-government street demonstrations. The state apparatus was crippled because most civil servants left their posts, and <PERSON> Saw </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> has ordered the employees back to work by Monday. But the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION>, the main opposition alliance seeking an end to 26 years of rule by a military autocracy, has urged workers to remain on strike until democracy is won. State radio said Wednesday that attendance at the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Planning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> was up to 74 percent. Other departments with more than half the workforce showing up were the ministries of Health, Home and Religious Affairs, Culture and Trade, the broadcast said. `` A lot of people are going back to work now so they can pick up their paycheck,'' said a <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> diplomat in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, who noted that pay day comes at the end of the month in <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>. `` We've had reports of people sitting around drinking tea. The diplomat added if the civil servants do not get paid `` that would be a very inflammatory thing.'' Prices for several basic commodities, including rice and gasoline, have skyrocketed during the recent anti-government protest, making it increasingly difficult for families to get by. Troops today drove away sidewalk hawkers in downtown <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> who have been a major form of commerce since large markets closed after the coup. No reason was given for the move, and similar streetside shops still were seen in other areas of the capital. Residents, meanwhile, say about fifty truckloads of troops left <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> on Monday, possibly to frontier areas where rebel groups reportedly are mounting offensives. The government has reported fierce fighting with <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> rebels in northeastern outposts. Soldiers had been brought to the capital from outlying regions to put down the anti-government demonstrations. Diplomats say many unarmed civilians were shot to death Sept. 19 by troops breaking up street protests. The official death toll since the coup is about 350, although the National League for Democracy says nearly 1,000 were killed. The league, led by retired brigadier general <PERSON> Aung </PERSON> <PERSON> Gyi </PERSON>, officially registered as a political party Wednesday but did not say if it would participate in elections promised by <PERSON> Saw </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON>. No date has been set for the vote. A second pro-democracy group, made up of followers of one-time Prime Minister U Nu, also registered, while a third opposition political party announced its formation. The ruling <ORGANIZATION> Burma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, which had been the sole political party since 1962 earlier, renamed itself the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. Western analysts say <PERSON> Saw </PERSON> <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> is behind the group, which has a well-established, amply funded nationwide network.

<HEAD>L.A. Mayor Unveils Plan to Cut Truck Traffic</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Mayor <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>'s plan to ease some of the nation's worst traffic congestion and air pollution by putting the brakes on rush-hour truck traffic triggered quick opposition from a state truckers' organization. The plan announced Wednesday is intended to keep out up to 70 percent of the heavy-duty trucks that normally operate on city streets during peak travel hours. `` No one doubts that truck shipments are vital to our economy,'' <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> said. `` The old saying, ` If you got it, a truck brought it,' still largely applies. But there is no reason so many truck deliveries must be made during these peak rush-hour travel times.'' <PERSON> Karen </PERSON> <PERSON> Rasmussen </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trucking </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, called <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>'s plan unfortunate and suggested it would not have a significant impact on traffic. A recent state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> study found that large trucks make up only 4.4 percent of peak-hour traffic in the morning and 2.8 percent in the evening, said Ms. <PERSON> Rasmussen </PERSON>, whose group represents more than 2,500 companies. <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>, who detailed the plan at a smoggy press conference surrounded by big rigs on the downtown Sports Arena parking lot, said it has the support of major trucking companies, the <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Quality </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION>, state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> and the Highway Patrol. Under the proposal, which must still be approved by the <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, only 30 percent of large truck fleets could operate on city roadways from 6 a.m. to 9 a.m. and from 4 p.m. to 7 p.m. The ban does not apply to freeways, although officials expect it to cause an indirect reduction there. The 30 percent of the trucks weighing 29,000 pounds or more that fleet owners decide to operate would have to pay up to $ 60 for a certificate. Stiff fines would be levied if a trucker operated without the certificate. The fees would help fund a multi-agency `` rapid deployment force'' that <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON> said would be used to clear snarled roadways of broken-down vehicles. The plan allows for case-by-case exemptions, which will likely cause the actual reduction to be about 50 percent, analysts with the mayor's office said. No one is sure how many trucks operate in the <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> area, said <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Bicker </PERSON>, the mayor's transportation policy adviser. He estimated the number of heavy rigs at 300,000 and said about 100,000 of those could receive peak-hour exemptions under the plan. The program is unique because there is no direct effort to restrict truck travel on freeways and highways, <PERSON> Bicker </PERSON> said. Such attempts in other cities have been blocked by federal judges who said they violate interstate commerce regulations. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Woerner </PERSON>, manager of <ORGANIZATION> Pathfinder </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trucking </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, which has a fleet of more than 20 large rigs, predicted truckers will be able to adapt more readily than shippers and receivers. `` Trucking is a 24-hour business. The shippers and receivers will have to change their hours, and you're looking at a lot of additional cost there,'' he said.

<TEXT>
 Two suspected Mafiosi were shot to death on the main street of a <LOCATION> Palermo </LOCATION> suburb, raising to 16 the number of people killed in gangland warfare in <LOCATION> Sicily </LOCATION> this week, police reported today. The victims, identified as <PERSON> Giuseppe </PERSON> <PERSON> Leone </PERSON>, 63, and <PERSON> Giuseppe </PERSON> <PERSON> Agrusa </PERSON>, 58, were killed in an ambush Wednesday night in <LOCATION> Cinisi </LOCATION>, a town 12 miles outside this Sicilian capital. Police said they were believed to be low-ranking gang members. Others killed this week include an anti-Mafia judge and his son and a Mafia boss and his wife. Officials have said there appears to be a major war between rival Mafia factions under way on the island and have described it as one the bloodiest gangland battles in recent years. Parliament is studying new measures to beef up the war on the Mafia, and the <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> called on the government to bring a halt to the killings. `` Evidently there's a war going on,'' said state's attorney <PERSON> Domenico </PERSON> <PERSON> Signorino </PERSON>, who helped prosecute <PERSON> Bontade </PERSON> in the mass trial of more than 400 <ORGANIZATION> Mafia </ORGANIZATION> suspects that ended last December. The wave of gangland killings comes at a time when officials in <LOCATION> Sicily </LOCATION> have complained the government was easing up on its anti-Mafia campaign. An assassination Monday of Judge <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Saetta </PERSON>, who presided over two major organized crime trials, was seen as an effort to intimidate officials at future trials. <PERSON> Saetta </PERSON> sentenced two powerful crime bosses, brothers <PERSON> Michele </PERSON> and <PERSON> Salvatore </PERSON> <PERSON> Greco </PERSON>, to life in prison.

<HEAD>Young AIDS Victim To Continue Schooling At Home</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TAMPA, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 A 7-year-old AIDS victim who is incontinent and mentally disabled will continue her schooling at home while an appellate panel decides whether to accept a plan allowing her to attend school in a glass booth. An attorney for <PERSON> Eliana </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> asked a three-judge panel Wednesday to overturn a ruling by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Kovachevich </PERSON> permitting <PERSON> Eliana </PERSON> to attend a school for trainable mentally disabled children under those conditions. <LOCATION> Hillsborough </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> school officials placed the girl in homebound instruction for fear she would transmit acquired immune deficiency syndrome to other children, but <PERSON> Rosa </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> won a two-year legal battle in August to get her adoptive daughter into the classroom. Refusing to send her daughter `` to sit in a cage,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> and her attorney <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanlon </PERSON> turned to the 11th U.S. <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> for an expedited hearing. Mrs. <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> attended the session and later was joined by <PERSON> Eliana </PERSON> on the courthouse steps. `` <PERSON> Eliana </PERSON> will not go into that glass enclosure,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> vowed. `` She would not be happy there. I want her in a regular classroom with trainable, mentally handicapped children just like her.'' The judges gave no indication when they would rule. <PERSON> Hanlon </PERSON> told the appellate panel he was n't opposed to classroom restrictions. But he suggested instead a kidney-shaped table as a precaution to put distance between <PERSON> Eliana </PERSON> and other children. `` It's a tough, tough case,'' said <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonzalez </PERSON>, an attorney for the school board, adding there are no previous cases dealing with a retarded, incontinent child with AIDS. Citing medical testimony from the trial, <PERSON> Hanlon </PERSON> said the risk of the girl transmitting the disease to classmates was a `` remote, theoretical potential.'' But the appeals judges said that testimony referred only to tears, saliva and urine, not to a condition of mouth sores and cracked lips called oral thrush that <PERSON> Eliana </PERSON> has experienced. The condition can result from AIDS. Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Vance </PERSON> said children touch each other's tongues and disabled children are known to bite each other. Open sores in the mouth could allow the transmission of blood, he said. To put a child in such a situation `` may be sentencing those children to death.'' <PERSON> Hanlon </PERSON> said <PERSON> Eliana </PERSON>'s doctors found no evidence of blood in the mouth, but <PERSON> Eliana </PERSON> would be kept out of class if that occurred. Doctors believe <PERSON> Eliana </PERSON> became infected from blood transfusions after her premature birth in <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>. Meanwhile, in <LOCATION> Arcadia </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> DeSoto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> officials said the family of three AIDS-exposed brothers once barred from the classroom will receive less than $ 1 million to settle the family's lawsuit against the board The settlement with the family of <PERSON> Ricky </PERSON>, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> and <PERSON> Randy </PERSON> <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> does not require school officials to admit any negligence in the way the boys or their family were treated, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Westberry </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> chairman, said Wednesday. <PERSON> Westberry </PERSON> would not be more specific about the amount of the settlement. Details of the out-of-court settlement were expected to be released today after attorneys for both sides met with <PERSON> Kovachevich </PERSON> in <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Clifford </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Louise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rays </ORGANIZATION>' suit sought unspecified damages. It alleged that their sons' civil rights were violated. <PERSON> Ricky </PERSON>, 11, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON>, 10, and <PERSON> Randy </PERSON>, 8, have hemophilia. Doctors say the boys probably came in contact with the AIDS virus from infected blood-based hemophilia medication.

<HEAD>``Kitten'' Of ``Father Knows Best'' Leading Rejuvenated Life</HEAD>
<DATELINE>KILLEEN, Texas (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 For a little more than seven years, <PERSON> Lauren </PERSON> <PERSON> Chapin </PERSON> was <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s perfect little sister on TV's `` Father Knows Best.'' But when her career abruptly ended, the child actress who played `` Kitten'' became a drug addict, unwed mother and prison inmate. During her traumatic, turbulent adolescence, Ms. <PERSON> Chapin </PERSON> became a has-been at 14, married at 16 and a heroin addict by her early 20s. She spent three years in prison and bore two children out of wedlock. But today she has found solace as a born-again <PERSON> Christian </PERSON> and a high school science teacher in the small central <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> town of <LOCATION> Killeen </LOCATION>. `` In <LOCATION> Killeen </LOCATION>, of all places,'' <PERSON> Chapin </PERSON> laughs. `` It's neat. I'm not their token actress My friends here love me for who I am now, for what I do now, not who I was.'' <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON>, or <PERSON> Kitten </PERSON> to her TV father, played by <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> in the 1950s comedy, is now 43. Her once-brown hair is strawberry blond, her face angular and unfreckled, her childhood chubbiness gone. But when she breaks into her cheek-splitting grin and pealing laughter, the young <PERSON> Kathy </PERSON> <PERSON> Anderson </PERSON> comes through loud and clear. `` I tried a lot of philosophies before I found the peace I'd been looking for,'' she said `` But when I did, my life changed. There was a boldness that I had not had before ...'' The third show-biz child of non-show-biz parents, she won her first part before her seventh birthday, defeating 250 other girls to play the youngest offspring in `` Father Knows Best.'' Ms. <PERSON> Chapin </PERSON> says the TV show cast almost was a family, and when the series ended suddenly she was not prepared. `` They never even said goodbye. We left one Friday night and got a letter that we were not to return to work. It was total abandonment,'' she said. As a short-statured, baby-faced 14-year-old, type cast to millions as the all-American little sister, she found herself icily rejected by the TV and movie industry, she said. She attempted to return to school, but it was a discipline for which she was unprepared, she said. `` I never went to school longer than a month, and it was hard to acclimate, to talk their lingo and try to fit in, especially when you're a movie star, and the kids think you're conceited,'' Ms. <PERSON> Chapin </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Dallas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION>. Ms. <PERSON> Chapin </PERSON>'s mother was a creative, classically trained pianist supportive of her daughter's ambitions. But at the same time, Ms. <PERSON> Chapin </PERSON> said, her mother was a hard-drinking housewife who subjected her children to debilitating verbal abuse. She said her relationship with her father was even more turbulent. To escape, she said, at the age of 16 she married a classmate she had known only 30 days. During their marriage of only three years, Ms. <PERSON> Chapin </PERSON> said, she suffered seven miscarriages and became addicted to heroin. After seven years of heavy heroin abuse, Ms. <PERSON> Chapin </PERSON> was sentenced to prison for attempted forgery. `` I floated in the real seedy side of life from 14 up to 26, caught up in the free-sex, free-drugs, free-love society.'' After three years in the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION>, Ms. <PERSON> Chapin </PERSON> entered a drug treatment program. During treatment, <PERSON> Chapin </PERSON> became engaged to another patient. When she became pregnant with her son <PERSON> Matt </PERSON>, now 15, she decided to keep her child but end the relationship. Five years later, Ms. <PERSON> Chapin </PERSON> had a second child, her daughter Summer, out of wedlock. She said she did not believe a marriage to the child's father would last. At that time, Ms. <PERSON> Chapin </PERSON> had a steady job with a brokerage firm, was sober and drug free. Friends introduced her to Christianity, something she always had rejected, she said, because she believed Christians were squares. But she said the religious experience transformed her. `` I had lived in fear, in low self-esteem, but as I allowed Christ in, all those things that had made me afraid and ashamed were softened and released and healed.'' She has shared that message through numerous speaking and television appearances. She also is working on an autobiography, due out next spring, titled `` Father Does Know Best.'' In December, Ms. <PERSON> Chapin </PERSON> will marry <LOCATION> Killeen </LOCATION> firefighter <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelley </PERSON>. `` A lot of people say that ` Father Knows Best' was too perfect, that life is n't like that. But it should be like that, and it can be like that.''

 By any standard except <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s, you could n't find a more beautiful day for going flying at the Kennedy Space Center today. The clouds were fleecy, the temperature mild and visibility was forever. The winds were benign. And that was the problem: too benign. The computers aboard space shuttle Discovery were configured with autumn conditions, expecting winds aloft at about 40 knots _ 46 miles an hour at 20,000 feet. Instead the readings were a spring-like 10-20 knots. If the winds did not pick up at least a little, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> said it would scrub the launch attempt and try again another day. `` If we were to fly through those, the computers that steer the ship would overcompensate and cause a wobble,'' said astronaut <PERSON> Jon </PERSON> <PERSON> McBride </PERSON>, who piloted a mission four years ago. `` This is a first,'' he added. `` I've never heard of a scrub because of mild winds.'' In the pre-Challenger days, officials might have given the go-ahead, but this is a new, more cautious regime. `` The bottom line is that its a lot more safe than it was before the Challenger,'' <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> administrator <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Fletcher </PERSON> said on <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Good Morning America.'' `` We probably went overboard just to be sure that there was n't anybody that was waiving something that should n't be waived The weather for example _ We're only about 5 or 6 percent out of tolerance. Well, we might have waived that. We do n't waive that anymore.''

 <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> will increase its yearly loans nearly 50 percent by 1992 to help end poverty in the Third World, the organization's president said today. <PERSON> Barber </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Conable </PERSON> spoke in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> during the annual meeting of the bank and its sister organization, the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION>. Participants from 151 nations have spent a week exploring ways to lighten the debt load of poor nations. The meeting ends today. Leftist groups have mounted protests to criticize the international banks, which make development loans, for insisting on repayment by Third World nations. About 1,000 demonstrators gathered at a church nearby Wednesday and chanted `` <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> Murder Meeting.'' Thousands of riot police held them back with plastic shields. Third World countries owe about $ 1.2 trillion to international and private lenders as well as governments. <PERSON> Conable </PERSON> predicted that the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> will be lending $ 25 billion dollars a year by 1992 to Third World nations. It now lends about $ 17 billion a year, and the monetary fund provides about $ 8 million more. Speaking at a news conference, he said $ 5 billion will go to the poorest countries, which are mainly in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Conable </PERSON> said the bank will strengthen its aid by sharing more financing with other donors. He said Japanese officials have told him they plan to help and promised to talk with him about a program. Contributions to the bank come from the 151 member governments. <PERSON> Conable </PERSON> also pinpointed trade imbalances as part of the debt problem faced by poor countries. He said they cause losses twice as great as the aid such countries receive from wealthier nations. Speakers from the Third World have protested repeatedly at the meeting that the industrial countries put up barriers to their exports that prevent debtor countries from earning money. In an interview before his news conference, <PERSON> Conable </PERSON> said he believed interest rates were stabilizing after recent increases. The financial leaders have listened this week to warnings that higher interest rates, used by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and other industrial countries to cool inflation, threaten the Third World. `` It would be highly undesirable if an excessive concern for inflation were to bring about a spiral of interest rate rises,'' said <PERSON> Giuliano </PERSON> <PERSON> Amato </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s treasury minister. At Wednesday's sessions, participants seeking new ways to ease the burden of debt heard about the cost of higher interest rates to Third World countries. Every 1 percent rise in interest rates costs the debtors $ 6 billion more a year, said <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Fischer </PERSON>, vice president and chief economist of the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and other industrial countries view higher interest as a way of controlling price increases. In the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, higher interest rates also attract money from abroad to meet the federal budget deficit. Third World countries pay more than $ 50 billion a year on loans subject to variable interest rates. They complain that too much of their earnings go to pay interest, leaving little to improve living standards. In many of them, especially in sub-Saharan <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, people's incomes have been declining for 20 years.

 Security forces arrested five more suspected right-wing extremists and uncovered evidence of financial support for efforts to topple President <PERSON> Corazon </PERSON> <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON>, the military said today. Brig. Gen. <PERSON> Rudolfo </PERSON> <PERSON> Biazon </PERSON>, chief of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Region </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>, said those arrested included three former soldiers and two civilians. Four were arrested late Wednesday and the fifth was captured today, <PERSON> Biazon </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Biazon </PERSON> told reporters they included retired Master Sgt. <PERSON> Domingo </PERSON> <PERSON> Escarcha </PERSON>, alleged founder of the <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commandos </ORGANIZATION>. The commandos, made up of renegade soldiers, took part in the 1986 coup attempt at the <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> Hotel and in other moves to topple the Aquino government. The arrests brought to nearly 70 the number of suspected right-wing extremists arrested in recent weeks. They included Lt. Col. <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Matillano </PERSON>, a leader of last year's bloody coup attempt, who was arrested Tuesday. <PERSON> Biazon </PERSON> said that during the raids, police found copies of documents pointing to financial support from unidentified `` outside sources.'' On Wednesday, <PERSON> Biazon </PERSON> told a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION> committee that unidentified businessmen and opposition politicians were under surveillance for possible links to military renegades, including former Lt. Col. <PERSON> Gregorio </PERSON> `` Gringo'' <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON> led the failed coup Aug. 28, 1987, which killed at least 53 people and wounded 300. <PERSON> Matillano </PERSON> was one of <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON>'s key lieutenants during the failed coup. Both were later arrested but escaped separately last April. In Wednesday's congressional testimony, <PERSON> Biazon </PERSON> said the business executives and politicians were providing `` financial support and a political component'' to the anti-Aquino movement. He said the military was collecting evidence `` before we take up action.'' The opposition <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION>, led by Vice President <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Laurel </LOCATION>, has demanded in a statement that Mrs. <PERSON> Aquino </PERSON> release immediately the names of all those suspected of links to <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON> and other rebel soldiers. Opposition Sen. <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ponce </PERSON> <PERSON> Enrile </PERSON>, the vice chairman of the union, denied he was personally linked to the mutineers and said he was ready to defend himself in court if the government tried to implicate him. <PERSON> Enrile </PERSON> was fired as defense minister in 1986 after a failed coup by his followers. <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON> was <PERSON> Enrile </PERSON>'s chief of security when he held the defense post. Also today, police shot and killed four people after they robbed an American army officer who had just arrived at <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>'s airport, and soldiers killed six other people in another incident near <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION>'s airport, officials said. Police identified the robbery victim as Army Capt. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>. They said four armed men stole his luggage and valuables, then sped off in a car and were later chased by police officers. Soldiers killed six people they said refused to stop at a checkpoint, officials said. Troops claimed the occupants opened fire, triggering a shootout near the <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> airport. No casualties were reported among the soldiers.

 A U.S.-Soviet clash over <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> remains unresolved, but <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> officials do not expect it to slow the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>'s withdrawal from the embattled country. Charging <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> and, indirectly, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> with violating the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> accords aimed at ending the Afghan war, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> on Wednesday hinted it might suspend its pullout unless <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> aid to Afghan guerrillas ends. A senior <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> official said today neither the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> nor the Afghan government would be at fault if the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> agreement was reduced to `` a useless piece of paper.'' Ambassador-at-large <PERSON> Nicolai </PERSON> <PERSON> Kozyrev </PERSON> made his comment to reporters in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dehli </LOCATION>. But a government spokesman in <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION> said <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> is not worried as long as <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> meets its Feb. 15 deadline for a complete withdrawal from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. `` It does not alarm us. We expect that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> will abide by its obligations,'' said <PERSON> Humayun </PERSON> <PERSON> Khan </PERSON>, secretary of state for foreign affairs. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> registered the Soviet complaint at a meeting of the five permanant members of the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, chaired by Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON>. Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> leveled a counterclaim that Soviet and Afghan bombing raids have violated Pakistani airspace. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> urged that the dispute be explored by <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> observers, who so far have not documented violations on either side, said <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Redman </PERSON>. <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> then escorted <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> from the Secretariat building and the Soviet news agency <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> said the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> foreign minister later flew home for a high-level <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> meeting. The two appeared grim and did not respond to reporters' questions But later, <PERSON> Redman </PERSON> said the Soviets `` left the impression'' they would maintain their troop withdrawal schedule. Under a U.N.-mediated accord signed in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> in April, the Soviets agreed to pull out all of their troops by February. <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> sent more than 100,000 troops into <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> since December 1979 to help prop up a Marxist government that is fighting Moslem guerrillas backed by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and other countries. A communique was released after the meeting of <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON>, <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> and the foreign ministers of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> that stressed the urgency for `` continuous talks'' to end the war between <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>. While <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> officials in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> said they expected the troop withdrawal to be completed by Feb. 15, as specified in the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> accords, a <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman hinted at a slowdown. `` We want to be as good as our word is concerning the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> accords,'' said the spokesman, <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON>. `` But we expect the other side also to be as good as its word.'' The Soviet official accused <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> of violations in supplying `` so-called freedom fighters'' with weapons. And <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> broadened the complaint to include the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` I guess they come from the American military-industrial complex, mainly,'' he said. `` The <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> accords say that <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> must not try to overthrow the government of <LOCATION> Kabul </LOCATION>. If you encourage the so-called freedom fighters to use the missiles to kill innocent people in the -LRB- <LOCATION> Afghan </LOCATION> -RRB- cities, I think it is a violation in our eyes.'' <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> was `` a good place to discuss fulfillment'' of the <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> accords. The session, attended also by Sir <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Howe </PERSON>, the <LOCATION> British </LOCATION> <ORGANIZATION> foreign </ORGANIZATION> secretary, and Foreign Ministers <PERSON> Roland </PERSON> <PERSON> Dumas </PERSON> of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Qian </PERSON> <PERSON> Qichen </PERSON> of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, was arranged before <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>'s departure for <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>. The Soviet spokesman acknowledged a Soviet pilot crossed the <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> border several weeks ago. But <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> stressed <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s support for the rebels at war with the Afghan government. `` It is a grave situation, and we must do something about it,'' he said.

<HEAD>Hundreds Revolt Against Docking Of Poison Ship</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MANFREDONIA, Italy (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Hundreds of people today stoned the town hall, blocked roads and clashed with riot police to protest the government's decision to allow a ship loaded with toxic waste to dock in this southern port. Most shops, public offices and schools were closed following a general strike called by local trade unions. `` It looks like a serious revolt,'' said one police officer who spoke on condition of anonymity. He said there were reports of injuries among police and demonstrators. The incidents broke out shortly after the federal government ruled that the Deep Sea Carrier should be allowed to dock at <LOCATION> Manfredonia </LOCATION>, along the <LOCATION> Adriatic </LOCATION> coast. The ship is carrying 2,500 tons of toxic waste and is expected to arrive at <LOCATION> Manfredonia </LOCATION> in a few days. The waste, originally shipped by Italian industrial companies to <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION> for disposal, has been ordered returned to <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION> by <LOCATION> Nigerian </LOCATION> authorities. Demonstrators shouting anti-government slogans hurled stones at the town hall, smashing windows and damaging parked cars. Protesters overturned police cars during scattered clashes with officers, according to city officials. Demonstrators, who are urging local authorities to defy the government decision and turn back the Deep Sea Carrier, also blocked several main roads, touching off major traffic jams. No Italian port wants to accept the chemical wastes. Two freighters, the Karin-B and <LOCATION> Khiam </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fea </LOCATION>, also are carrying waste and have been accompanying the Deep Sea Carrier. Karin-B has been moored off the <LOCATION> Tyrrhenian </LOCATION> port of Leghorn for 10 days. Local authorities and residents do n't want to unload it until the national government announces a plan for disposal of the waste elsewhere. <LOCATION> Khiam </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fea </LOCATION> is sailing toward the <LOCATION> Adriatic </LOCATION> port of <LOCATION> Ravenna </LOCATION>, where protests have also taken place. According to Italian companies that shipped the waste through an agent, <LOCATION> Nigeria </LOCATION> had originally authorized dumping of it in <LOCATION> Koko </LOCATION> but later reneged on the agreement.

<HEAD>High Court Censure's Judge for Rude Behavior Toward Woman</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The state's highest court has censured a judge for rudeness to a woman who sought court protection from her violent husband, but allowed him to continue on the bench, a decision criticized by the woman's family. <LOCATION> Somerville </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Heffernan </PERSON> did grant a protection order, but the woman, <PERSON> Pamela </PERSON> <PERSON> Nigro </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON>, was later murdered by her husband. The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judicial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on Wednesday expressed its disapproval of <PERSON> Heffernan </PERSON>'s `` discourtesy, rudeness and sarcasm'' toward Mrs. <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON> at a 1986 hearing. The decision involves no fine or reduction in <PERSON> Heffernan </PERSON>'s powers and essentially follows the recommendation more than a year ago of <PERSON> Heffernan </PERSON>'s attorney. The five justices dismissed allegations of a pattern of discourteousness by <PERSON> Heffernan </PERSON> toward women. They noted <PERSON> Heffernan </PERSON> granted Mrs. <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON> the protection she sought from her husband, <PERSON> Paul </PERSON>, who had beaten her. They also said <PERSON> Heffernan </PERSON>'s rude behavior toward Mrs. <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON> had nothing to do with her murder in August 1986. <PERSON> Carole </PERSON> <PERSON> Nigro </PERSON>, Mrs. <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON>'s mother, said the high court should have specifically barred <PERSON> Heffernan </PERSON> from hearing domestic cases. `` I'm not saying he was the cause of her murder, but just the way he handles women in court is wrong,'' she said. The Nigros initiated the case two years ago by charging that <PERSON> Heffernan </PERSON> humiliated and belittled Mrs. <PERSON> Dunn </PERSON>. The high court recommended private censure of <PERSON> Heffernan </PERSON>, meaning, in most cases, that its ruling would never be made public. But the court decided to publicize its decision because of the publicity the case has received. <PERSON> Heffernan </PERSON>, 55, of <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, did not return phone calls seeking comment. His attorney, <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Dwyer </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, said the judge accepts the ruling. In its decision, the court proposed creation of a process by which a judge's performance can be evaluated and improved confidentially. <PERSON> Dwyer </PERSON> said <PERSON> Heffernan </PERSON> considered the matter closed. He said <PERSON> Heffernan </PERSON> had voluntarily withdrawn from domestic dispute cases and had no immediate plans to resume hearing them.

 There was more at stake than pride and adventure. The 32-month grounding of the shuttle fleet has set back the nation's satellite-delivery system Discovery's first order of business in space was release of a $ 100 million communications satellite. The Tracking and Data Relay Satellite, to be released six hours after liftoff, is a twin of a craft lost with Challenger. `` This has been a long 2 -LCB- years,'' shuttle chief Truly said of the months of remorse, restructuring and rebuilding that followed the explosion that shook <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s confidence in its space effort. Excitement built at the Kennedy Space Center area as launch neared. Campers and recreation vehicles found viewing places along the <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. Souvenir sellers set up shop. Police handled a series of pre-dawn traffic jams and guesstimated the crowd at a rather modest quarter-of-a-million. Not since the first shuttle flight, in 1981, has there been such interest in an American launch. During the past 32 months, 16 Soviet cosmonauts have traveled to space, leaving the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> far behind in whatever remains of the space race. <PERSON> Hauck </PERSON> said in a prelaunch interview that he recognized the great significance of his mission. `` We clearly can not afford to lose another vehicle, much less another crew,'' he said. `` I do n't think the manned space program could withstand another Challenger.'' `` Flying into space never will be risk free,'' <PERSON> Hauck </PERSON> said. `` It's a matter of reducing the risks to a minimum and balancing the risks that are involved with what we are trying to accomplish.'' During the four-day orbital journey, the astronauts planned to conduct 11 science and technology experiments and to test design changes to the shuttle. <PERSON> Hauck </PERSON> said they planned a special memorial in space for Challenger's five man, two woman crew. The nature of the memorial would be revealed during a news conference the astronauts were to hold in orbit on the mission's third day, he said. `` If we ever forget what happened to Challenger, it's going to be a sad day, because we might become complacent once again,'' <PERSON> Hilmers </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Covey </PERSON> reported the flight will be less complicated than most previous missions because <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> has elected to take a conservative approach. In all, 56 major changes and more than 400 lesser ones have been made to the shuttle. The program to redesign all three remaining shuttles cost $ 2.4 billion. The effort focused on the two solid fuel booster rockets that help thrust the shuttle into space. Flame escaped through a faulty joint in Challenger's right booster and touched off the explosion. A cold temperature of 38 degrees at launch time contributed to the accident by stiffening O-ring seals, preventing them from sealing the joint. Some engineers had argued with lower-level managers against launching in the cold, but their concerns were not relayed to those making the launch decision. That prompted significant changes in the way <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> and contractor managers communicate with their workers and led to creation of the countdown oversight team headed by <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Crippen </PERSON>. `` Under the new system,'' <PERSON> Crippen </PERSON> said, `` the lines of communications are open to anyone, anywhere in the system.'' Among the changes to the orbiter was the addition of an emergency escape system featuring a blowout cabin hatch and a 12-foot aluminum and steel telescoping pole. In case of a problem during a landing attempt while the shuttle is in stable, gliding flight, the astronauts could slide down the pole, clearing the wings, and parachute to safety. The system would not be of use in a Challenger-type accident. Because of the escape system, the astronauts were to wear the cumbersome pressure suits on liftoff and landing, instead of the comfortable cotton flight suits worn on recent missions.

 Workers held hostage by two gunmen at a newspaper eight months ago say they suffered no physical damage, but their sense of security is gone forever. `` I find myself constantly looking over my shoulder,'' accounting clerk <PERSON> Deborah </PERSON> <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> testified Wednesday. `` I do n't feel safe anywhere now.'' She was one of 20 people held hostage at <LOCATION> The </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Robesonian </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Lumberton </LOCATION> for up to 10 hours Feb. 1 by two Indian activists demanding an investigation of drug trafficking, racial discrimination and corruption in <LOCATION> Robeson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION>. `` I've had nightmares,'' said <PERSON> Rita </PERSON> <PERSON> Parker </PERSON>, the newspaper's classified ad manager, who escaped from the newspaper building just as the incident was getting under way `` I found myself at work, even months after that, watching the front door every time it opened.'' Defendants <PERSON> Eddie </PERSON> <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON>, 31, and <PERSON> Timothy </PERSON> <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON>, 20, are charged with conspiracy, hostage taking and weapons violations. They have never denied taking over the newspaper, but say they had no other choice because their lives were in danger. They claim law enforcement officers were planning to kill them because of their charges. But the presiding judge in the case Wednesday disallowed testimony that the takeover was in effect an act of self-defense. `` The ` necessity defense' is not available to private citizens who take vigilante action,'' <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Terrence </PERSON> <PERSON> Boyle </PERSON> said. `` The perpetrator of the harm has to be the object of the action. ... You can not randomly choose innocent persons to take action against.'' In a telephone call to The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> late Wednesday night, <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON> said <PERSON> Boyle </PERSON> should be impeached, calling his decision `` outright wicked behavior.'' <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON> has not participated in the trial, claiming his constitutional rights are being violated because his attorney of choice, <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Kunstler </PERSON>, is not present. <PERSON> Kunstler </PERSON>, the prominent radical lawyer, is involved in a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> case, but <PERSON> Boyle </PERSON> denied a request for another delay in the trial here until that trial winds up. The workers who testified Wednesday said they thought they would be killed when two men drew sawed-off shotguns from under their long coats and chained the doors. `` I really thought we'd had it,'' said <PERSON> Jo </PERSON> <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> Manns </PERSON>, the receptionist who first saw the gunmen. `` I thought they were going to get rough. I did n't know if we were going to get out alive or not.'' Ms. <PERSON> Adams </PERSON> said <PERSON> Hatcher </PERSON>, angry and nervous `` almost to the point of being hysterical,'' told his hostages that his life was in jeopardy. `` He said he could not get anyone to listen to him. He said Sheriff -LRB- <PERSON> Hubert </PERSON> -RRB- Stone had a contract out on him and he needed to talk to the governor,'' she said. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Warren </PERSON>, an attorney for <PERSON> Jacobs </PERSON>, told the jurors the defense would show `` how cocaine had corrupted law enforcement in the county, how poor people without jobs were offered quick money to sell cocaine under the protection of law enforcement.''

<HEAD>Human Rights Ruling on Health Care for People With AIDS</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A decision by the city's <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rights </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> to force a dental clinic to pay $ 47,000 to two men it refused to treat was a victory for those battling AIDS discrimination, officials say. `` It is difficult to measure the kind of misery and suffering that others inflict on people with AIDS,'' Mayor <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> said. `` There is no way to adequately describe the pain and humiliation which discrimination adds to the disease.'' Commission Chairman <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brandon </PERSON> said the commission found Wednesday that Northern Dispensary, a <LOCATION> Greenwich </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Village </LOCATION> clinic, violated the city's human rights law when it refused treatment to two longtime patients. One has AIDS and the other has tested positive for the AIDS antibody. `` This case is an important step forward in preserving the rights and dignity of all people,'' he said. The commission also ordered the health facility to post a notice that it does not discriminate against disabled persons, including those with AIDS or HIV, the virus that causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome. A message for comment left at the clinic was not returned. One of the patients, <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitmore </PERSON>, a free-lance writer, said he had told a dentist at the dispensary in 1986 to be careful not to cut his gums while cleaning his teeth because `` when the immune system is low it takes a long time to heal.'' He said it was then that he told the dentist he had AIDS. `` He continued to clean my teeth, then stopped, talked to another dentist and the administrator came over and said it was not their policy to treat people with AIDS,'' he said. `` I was very angry,'' he said. `` I was really outraged.'' <PERSON> Brandon </PERSON> said with infection control techniques already in place at the dispensary, the men posed no threat of contagion to dentists. He said Northern Dispensary claimed it was justified in refusing to treat the patients for legitimate medical and financial reasons and thereby did not engage in discriminatory conduct. AIDS is spread through sexual contact, needles or syringes shared by drug abusers, infected blood or blood products, and from pregnant women to their offspring.

 A 22-year-old man was slashed across the ear with a straight razor after he came to the aid of a pickpocket victim on a subway train. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Eagan </PERSON> was listed in good condition at <ORGANIZATION> Northwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> after surgeons reconstructed his ear, which had been deeply cut in the incident Wednesday. There have been no arrests. The attack was the lastest in a series of violent incidents on public transportation. Two people have been killed and a woman raped on or near <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> Transit Authority facilities in the last two weeks. <PERSON> Eagan </PERSON> said he spotted a man putting his hand in the purse of a woman boarding the train and banged on the train window to warn her. The man stopped for a minute, then began putting his hand in the woman's purse again, he said. `` I guess I embarrassed him in front of the others in the car,'' said <PERSON> Eagan </PERSON>, a service representative for an air freight company. `` I said ` Why do you have to steal? Why do n't you get a job and work?' ... He said, ` I'm going to get you.' <PERSON> Eagan </PERSON> said the man whispered to a companion, then `` the second guy grabs me and holds me while the first guy pulls a big straight razor and takes a swing and misses. He tries again and I jerk away, but he got my ear.'' Two men came to his aid in pushing off the attackers, <PERSON> Eagan </PERSON> said. The assailants fled. The woman whose purse was being picked `` kept thanking me and thanking me, but I was thinking about my ear,'' said <PERSON> Eagan </PERSON>. Meanwhile, <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON> <PERSON> Sliwa </PERSON>, founder of the New York-based <ORGANIZATION> Guardian </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angels </ORGANIZATION> civilian patrol group, said he would come to <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> to help fight violence on the CTA.

<TEXT>
 A tony shopping mall has given a 72-year-old organ grinder the boot after 29 years because he and his monkeys are n't fancy enough for the upscale stores. `` It was purely a business decision,'' said <PERSON> Warren </PERSON> <PERSON> Chaumont </PERSON>, marketing director for <LOCATION> Lenox </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Square </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> area's best-known shopping mall. `` Having an organ grinder in the middle of the center was not in keeping with the caliber of stores.

 <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> told <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> schoolchildren today a Dukakis-Bentsen administration would make the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> the leader in space exploration again, and he called on them to consider becoming `` part of this new generation of space pioneers.'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, the Democratic vice presidential nominee, spoke to the students while waiting with them to watch the scheduled launch of the space shuttle Discovery on television. The launch `` marks a new beginning in our space program,'' the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> senator told the middle school students. `` It is a good beginning but there are more challenges ahead of us.'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> told the students that Democratic presidential nominee <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was committed to the shuttle program and to a permanently manned <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> space station. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has promised to revive a Cabinet-level space council and put <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> in charge of it. `` When <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and I are elected president and vice president of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, we will make sure that <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s space program is first rate We will work to regain leadership in the race to new frontiers. We will commit <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> to a program of exploration and adventure second to none,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said. That program, he said, would depend on a new generation of scientists and explorers, and he challenged the students to dedicate themselves to studying math and science. `` Machines can go into space, but only men and women explore space, probing for its secrets and reaching for the stars,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said. From <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> was heading home to <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, where he was to join <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> fund-raiser. At appearances Wednesday night in <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said that if the Republicans win the election, a <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> administration would endanger Social Security and provide inadequate ethical safeguards. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> promised that he and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> would `` never, no never, turn our backs on kickbacks'' to defense contractors and consultants, a reference to the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> procurement scandal now unraveling in the nation's capital. Also, as <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has recently, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> might tap the Social Security trust fund to help balance the federal budget deficit and recalled <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s 1985 vote against cost-of-living adjustments to Social Security recipients. `` In Social Security, in whom do you want to put your trust?'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said at the second <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION> fund-raiser. Then, turning a favorite <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> line, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said: `` My friends, do n't just read their lips, watch what they do.'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had a proven record as a fiscal manager and challenged Republicans on their use of the nickname `` Taxachusetts'' to describe the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor's home state. `` When they talk about ` Taxachusetts,' ask them the date they called it ` Taxachusetts,''' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said. The nickname was pinned on the state in the 1970s, when its tax burden was among the nation's highest. The tax burden now ranks 34th among the 50 states. `` It's the difference between an eight-year photo opportunity and a country on the move again,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said of the stakes of the November election. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign aides in <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> said they have not done any recent polls but that they believe they are trailing <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> by a few points. Former presidential candidate <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> worked the fund-raising crowd in an effort to whip up support for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, urging his former supporters to work for the Democratic ticket. The <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION> senator said <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> was prepared to step in as president while <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential candidate <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was not. `` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s values and <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s future might well be at stake,'' <PERSON> Gore </PERSON> said. That line of attack was similar to one used by <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> earlier Wednesday in <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION>, where he visited the birthplace of <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> Truman </PERSON> to promise an active vice presidency and question both <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s qualifications and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s judgment in selecting the 41-year-old <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> senator. `` If they were elected, I'd pray for the good health of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> every night,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said, painting <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> as a member of the far-right `` out of the mainstream of where the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people find their hopes and their dreams and their aspirations.''

 <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeepers today radioed word of their Nobel Peace Prize victory to battalions in battle-scarred <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and cracked open bottles of champagne in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> to celebrate the prestigious award. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> paid tribute to the peacekeeping forces worldwide after the Nobel Committee announced they will receive the Nobel Peace Prize. Spokesmen said the prize would give a boost to <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> efforts to contain global conflicts. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials in <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION>, which contributes more peacekeeping troops than any other country, said they hoped the prize would induce members to pay their bills for the financially ailing forces. `` The recent achievements of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> have neither been sudden nor fortuitous, but are the hard-won results of persistence and dedication over many years, epitomized by the peacekeeping activities of the Organizations,'' <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> told the delegates to the 43rd General Assembly. `` The awarding of the prize to the peacekeepers is obviously a token of world appreciation for the work of the force,'' said Capt. <PERSON> Mikael </PERSON> <PERSON> Heinrichs </PERSON>, senior officer in the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> office in <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION>. `` I am sure that it will help with finding enough international will to help finance the force.'' `` The international community has finally given appropriate recognition to all the sacrifices our people have made,'' <PERSON> Timor </PERSON> <PERSON> Goksel </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interim </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. `` There is great joy. This came as a pleasant surprise,'' <PERSON> Goksel </PERSON> said in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Naqoura </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. `` We just got the news,'' Lt. Col. <PERSON> Gerry </PERSON> <PERSON> McMahon </PERSON>, 52, of <ORGANIZATION> Newbridge </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, told the <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> by telephone. `` We are sending it by radio to various battaltions. It's the fastest way to get it out to everyone.'' <PERSON> McMahon </PERSON>, a senior operations officer, said the peacekeepers often felt their job was a thankless one `` but we get used to that after a few years. It may not make world headlines, but every day you have a small achievement on the ground.'' <PERSON> Goksel </PERSON> said 100,000 men and women from 15 countries have served in <ORGANIZATION> UNIFIL </ORGANIZATION> `` under very difficult circumstances'' since it was formed in 1978. Of those, 156 troops have been killed, 230 were wounded in action and two are missing, he said. In <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> French </PERSON>, a spokesman for the U.N. Truce Supervision Organization, said: `` Any acclamation and recognition of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION>'s valuable role helps to assist the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> in peacekeeping and as a world forum for peace.'' `` <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> forces have labored a long time under great difficulties in the cause of peace,'' <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> told The <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION>. Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Vadset </PERSON>, chief of staff of the U.N. Truce Supervision Organization, added, `` We have, so to speak, lived through all the wars you can think of, and one might say that we have been unsuccessful in not preventing them. I Think we have been successful in being available to try to minimize disaster when it first broke out `` `` We are, of course, very, very glad to receive the Nobel Peace Prize.

<HEAD>Appeals Court Reduces Model's Acne Award</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An appellate court has reduced a $ 2 million judgment won by a model who claimed that her face was scarred by acne caused by cosmetics. In a decision issued Tuesday, the court gave <PERSON> Teresa </PERSON> <PERSON> Norris </PERSON>, who had a contract with the <PERSON> Wilhemina </PERSON> modeling agency, the option of accepting a reduced sum of $ 400,000 or going through another trial. Miss <PERSON> Norris </PERSON>, now 28 and living in <LOCATION> Paradise </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, bought $ 147 worth of beauty products from an <PERSON> Erno </PERSON> <PERSON> Laszlo </PERSON> cosmetic seller in a <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> department store in 1981 after the employee told her she had oily skin. After eight months and an additional $ 250 in Laszlo products, <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Norris </PERSON>' complexion was `` destroyed by deep-pitted scars and ice-pick-type marks,'' attorney <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Jaroslawicz </PERSON> charged in the model's damage suit. During the March 1987 trial in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Miss </PERSON> <PERSON> Norris </PERSON> testified that she became depressed. `` I stayed home alone. I cried a lot,'' she said. She stopped working, her marriage broke up and she lost her sexual drive, she said during the trial. Cosmetic experts backed her claims and testified that the <PERSON> Laszlo </PERSON> products had ingredients in them that caused acne. The formula was changed in 1982. <PERSON> Laszlo </PERSON> attorney <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Ameroso </PERSON> argued that Miss <PERSON> Norris </PERSON> had oily skin and acne before she ever used <PERSON> Laszlo </PERSON> products. He said her only pain and suffering was depression caused by her acne and that any lost income could not be accurately projected. The jury had awarded Miss <PERSON> Norris </PERSON> $ 1 million for lost income and $ 1 million for pain and suffering. In its four-paragraph decision reducing the award, the three-judge appellate panel said both sums were excessive.

<TEXT>
 Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, with actor and environmentalist <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Redford </PERSON> at his side, took aim today at the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's environmental record and promised a toxic waste site cleanup within eight years. As for his Republican opponent in the presidential race, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said, `` Calling <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> an environmentalist is like calling <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> a statesman.'' In a speech prepared for delivery at <ORGANIZATION> Rutgers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> cited <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s role as chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Regulatory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Relief </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> and blamed the vice president for blocking regulations to reduce lead in the air as well as a plan to control toxic wastes. An active environmentalist and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> supporter, <PERSON> Redford </PERSON> joined the Democratic nominee on the platform at <LOCATION> Rutgers </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> received the endorsement of the League of Conservation Voters, <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION>, Friends of the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> and Clean Water Action. `` Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s administration has had eight years to clean up toxic wastes,'' said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. `` They've started the cleanup on only 137 sites on the National Priorities List out of a total of 1,200.'' He said that in his administration `` cleanup will be completed or well under way at every single one of the nearly 1,200 Superfund sites on the National Priorities List by December 1996.'' Companies responsible for pollution that want to help in the cleanup would get government assistance, he said, adding, `` For the foot-draggers and the chronic polluters I have just one message: you better vote for Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> because if I'm elected the game is over.'' He also vowed to collect `` every dime we can of the more than $ 700 million in cleanup costs that have n't been paid by the polluters.'' While blasting the Republican administration's record on the environment, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> remained defensive about the pollution in his own back yard. `` Let me say a word about my favorite harbor,'' said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. He called <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> the oldest in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and said, `` People started throwing things into it more than a century before the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. And Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> does n't know what he's talking about because we're cleaning up <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>. And we've had to fight Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and the administration he belongs to every inch of the way.'' On Wednesday, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> met with Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>, who denied he or his government tilted toward the Republicans in the presidential race. `` It's up to the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people to elect a president,'' he said. `` That's the main thing.'' After meeting with <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> met with West German Foreign Minister <PERSON> Hans-Dietrich </PERSON> <PERSON> Genscher </PERSON>. They posed for pictures but did not discuss their conversation. All the foreign officials were in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> for the opening of the current session of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> met Friday with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, and the vice president was quick to point out: `` It is a pleasure for me to see Mr. <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> again. We have met several times.'' For his part, the Soviet official acted pleased to confirm <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s claim and then some. `` This is not our first meeting,'' he said. `` He -LRB- <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> -RRB- has been involved in all high-level discussions here in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and -LRB- in -RRB- our talks with the president.'' For <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> it was a nice political boost, confirmation from the Soviet officials that the vice president had been more than just an onlooker in administration discussions with the other superpower. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> could make no comparable claim. But <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> did his best to give <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> a measure of equality. He described his discussion with the <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor as `` very interesting, constructive and profound.'' He had called his talk with <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> `` a very interesting, a very substantive and a very profound discussion.'' The recent signing of an arms control treaty and the general signs of improvement in U.S.-Soviet relations left <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> with little choice but to tip his hat to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. `` I made it clear to the foreign minister that I was not here to negotiate or discuss specific proposals,'' said the Democratic presidential nominee. `` We have one president and I support President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s effort to move forward on these issues right up to the end of his term in office. ... I intend to build on the work that President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has begun.'' <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> welcomed <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' reference to continuity. `` He spoke in support of continuity and consistency, having in mind support for the recent positive trends in Soviet-American relations. This is very important,'' said the Soviet foreign minister. While <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was willing to give <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> credit for the warming in superpower relations, he hammered away at the administration on ethics and the economy. `` In a <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> administration, we're not going to turn the White House into a wheel of fortune for future foreign agents,'' he told a rally in <LOCATION> Greensburg </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said that on his first day as president he would sign an executive order barring top administration officials who leave his administration from lobbying government agencies for the duration of his administration Current law prohibits them from lobbying their former agencies for one year after leaving officce. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> also ridiculed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s proposal for establishment of individual savings accounts, a plan <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said would save middle class taxpayers `` 20 bucks a year.'' At the same, he said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s plan to cut capital gains taxes would give the wealthiest Americans a $ 30,000 annual tax break. `` <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> plays <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Claus </LOCATION> to the wealthy and <PERSON> Ebenezer </PERSON> <PERSON> Scrooge </PERSON> to the rest of us,'' said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>.

 <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmoke </PERSON>, taking his case for legalizing drug possession to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, said today that making illicit drugs available legally would help, not hurt, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Schmoke </PERSON> told a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> committee that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has tried vigorously for 75 years to rid itself of the what he described as the reality that drug prohibition increases crime without doing away with addiction. `` Nevertheless, that reality remains as true today as ever,'' he told the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Select </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Narcotics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Abuse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION>. `` We have spent nearly 75 years and untold billions of dollars trying to square the circle, and inevitably we have failed.'' Instead of a drug policy based primarily on law enforcement, <PERSON> Schmoke </PERSON> proposed `` a measured and carefully implemented program of drug decriminalization,'' similar to the repeal of the 1920s' prohibition on alcohol He conceded that there were risks in what he was suggesting. `` Providing legal access to currently illicit substances carries with it the chance, although by no means the certainty, that the number of people using and abusing drugs will increase. `` But addiction, for all of its attendant medical, social and moral problems, is but one evil associated with drugs. Moreover, the criminalization of narcotics, cocaine and marijuana has not solved the problem of their use.'' Opening the hearing, the committee chairman, Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rangel </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, who has opposed <PERSON> Schmoke </PERSON>'s proposal, said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> now spends $ 140 billion a year on illicit drugs and absorbs another $ 100 billion a year in lost productivity and drug-related crime. `` I am not ready to spend more of the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people's money on drugs and crime and property loss, which is what would happen under legalization,'' he said. `` I am concerned about the impact of drugs on the future of this country,'' <PERSON> Rangel </PERSON> said. `` But, unlike some of those who have grown weary of this crisis, I am in no way ready to give up and say that we have fought the fight and have lost the war on drugs.'' The chance of congressional approval of drug legalization is nil. Mayors <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> of the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Callahan </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Annapolis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Carrie </PERSON> <PERSON> Saxon </PERSON> <PERSON> Perry </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Hartford </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, were among 32 other witnesses scheduled to testify at the hearing.

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> called extraordinary meetings of its legislature and of the policy-making <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, and a source said today that a shake-up in the party hierarchy is likely in line with <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s reforms. The convening of the 300-member <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Friday and of the 1,500-member Supreme Soviet on Saturday brought officials rushing back to the capital. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> arrived in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> this afternoon after cutting short his visit to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, the official <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency announced. Defense Minister <PERSON> Dmitri </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yazov </PERSON> ended a visit to <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> a day ahead of schedule. The Supreme Soviet, the nominal parliament, usually convenes twice a year after meetings of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. It last convened May 24-26. Soviet media reported Sunday that a regular session of the Supreme Soviet would begin Oct. 27, and the announcement of a special sitting at such short notice indicated urgent government business. The <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> had been expected to meet by the end of October, but the source said reform plans were proceeding `` faster than was expected.'' The source, who is a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> staff, said the committee will approve reforms in the party and government structure outlined at a <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> conference in June. The reforms are intended to enhance the party's status as the leading force in Soviet society. He added that it's `` logical'' that personnel changes will follow any alterations in the organizations' format. The source spoke on condition of anonymity. Echoing an announcement by <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> on Wednesday, the source said the meeting would `` take new steps in implementing political reform,'' based on the decisions of the party conference. Meetings of the 300-member <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, although rarely announced in advance, are generally scheduled well ahead of time and do not require top officials to curtail other commitments. At its last meeting, on July 29, the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> adopted a timetable for overhauling the Soviet political system, which also was discussed at the party conference. The first deadline set was October, by which time the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> said a draft law on amendments to the Soviet Constitution and on multi-candidate elections of legislators was to be complete. In a speech Friday, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>, the Soviet leader, said the Politburo soon would convene to review the draft law. But comments by <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> source put the focus on changes in the Communist Party structure. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> could be seeking to strengthen his hand in the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> to push through the political reforms. Soviet sources said today there was `` no crisis'' in the leadership. A well-placed Soviet journalist said he expected no `` sensation'' from the plenum. Soviet sources also reported speculation among high-placed officials about whether there would be changes on the Politburo itself, indicating uncertainty even at high levels about the agenda. The <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> is empowered to make personnel changes in the Politburo. The last full Politburo member removed was <PERSON> Geidar </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Aliev </PERSON> on Oct. 21, 1987. <PERSON> Aliev </PERSON> was a close protege of former President <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>, who now is harshly criticized for permitting corruption and stagnation. Official Soviet newspapers today carried nothing about the meeting, but the <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency and English-language broadcasts of official <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Moscow </ORGANIZATION> reported that <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> was curtailing his visit and returning home for the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> meeting. The conference of 5,000 <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> officials held in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> at the end of June and beginning of July approved plans to limit terms of <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> officials and a review of the entire 20-million party membership. There also has been speculation that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s backers want to remove 60 60 to 70 `` dead souls'' from the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>. They are party leaders elected to the committee shortly after <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> took power in March 1985, but since then have lost the party or government jobs that entitled them to committee membership. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> has criticized the party apparatus for being too involved in the day-to-day operation of the government and the economy, and has argued that reforms must focus party work on establishing broad policies and theories. Personnel changes could give <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and his backers a chance to move out conservative party bureaucrats that they see blocking the Soviet leader's reforms. In a speech in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> on Wednesday, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> once more called for radical changes in Soviet society. `` Any of the current burning problems underscores the necessity of radical change. It is needed in the party, in the state, in agriculture, in industry, in personnel policy and most of all in people's mentality, in their attitudes to work, to one another and to themselves,'' <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said at a <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> dinner honoring visiting East German leader <PERSON> Erich </PERSON> <PERSON> Honecker </PERSON>.

<HEAD>Talks Over Blood Test Collapse</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 A lawyer will ask a judge to decide how a blood sample will be taken from a 9-year-old girl to help determine if she was switched with another as an infant in a hospital nursery. <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellin </PERSON>, a lawyer representing a <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> couple who think the <LOCATION> Sarasota </LOCATION> girl may be theirs, said he wanted the sophisticated blood testing done by <ORGANIZATION> Johns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hopkins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> technicians and the results made public, two conditions rejected by the girl's attorney. He said he would file a court petition Monday. <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Swope </PERSON>, who represents the girl's father, said Wednesday his client will seek genetic tests on his own _ under a cloak of secrecy. In a statement, he said, `` If it produces unsettling results, they will be kept confidential until our client has had a chance to explain this tragedy to his child. Then, in time, after she has adjusted to it, we will disclose it to other interested parties.'' The tests of blood samples identify genetic links between parent and child. Neither side has released the names of the father or girl involved. <PERSON> Regina </PERSON> and <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> Twigg </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Langhorne </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, have claimed in a $ 100 million lawsuit that three doctors and a nurse at tiny <ORGANIZATION> Hardee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Wauchula </LOCATION> switched their healthy baby girl with an infant that was suffering from a congenital heart defect. The couple nursed the sick girl, <PERSON> Arlena </PERSON> <PERSON> Twigg </PERSON>, until she died recently. Tests taken before a heart operation at a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> hospital indicated <PERSON> Arlena </PERSON>'s blood type was different from theirs. Further sophisticated tests ruled out any biological relationship.

 A man was charged in the killing of an up-and-coming drug gang leader, a slaying that sparked a rampage by up to 200 youths who flipped and burned cars and torched and looted a store, authorities said. Several of the youths fired shots into the air, but no one was injured or arrested in Tuesday night's rampage, police said. The mayhem came in retaliation for late Monday's killing of <PERSON> Luis </PERSON> <PERSON> Antonio </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortiz </PERSON>, 20, whom Police Commissioner <PERSON> Willie </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> described Wednesday as an emerging drug gang leader. Authorities said the death came after a member of a rival gang was fatally injured on a motorcycle he had bought from <PERSON> Ortiz </PERSON>. Wednesday morning, <PERSON> Andres </PERSON> <PERSON> Albaladejo </PERSON>, 33, surrendered and was charged with murder and weapons offenses in connection with <PERSON> Ortiz </PERSON>'s death, police said <PERSON> Ortiz </PERSON>'s pickup truck was adorned Wednesday with funeral wreaths and candles. `` I was very upset that we still live in an era when the death of a drug dealer who peddles death, a man who is accused of a homicide himself, but not convicted, was being made a hero ... in a neighborhood where drugs are taking more lives than perhaps anything else,'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said at a news conference. `` It indicates that we and the community have a lot of work to do to correct this.'' <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said police would increase patrols in the poor Hunting Park neighborhood through the weekend. Wednesday night and this morning, an `` uneasy calm'' rested over the neighborhood, <PERSON> Bennie </PERSON> <PERSON> Swans </PERSON>, the city's <ORGANIZATION> Crisis </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intervention </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> director, said today. Swans met with representatives of the two groups Wednesday night _ <PERSON> Ortiz </PERSON>'s OK Corral gang and the rival Gray Tape gang. He said he is confident `` that the community is continuing to place enough pressure on the two groups to cool out.'' Swans said a Gray Tape gang member, <PERSON> Richie </PERSON> <PERSON> Colon </PERSON>, 18, died Monday from injuries suffered Saturday when he crashed a motorcycle he had bought from <PERSON> Ortiz </PERSON>. Swans would n't comment on published reports quoting unidentified neighborhood residents as saying the motorcycle had bad brakes. The first signs of trouble came hours after <PERSON> Ortiz </PERSON>'s death, when youths looted and burned a grocery store owned by a brother of <PERSON> Albaladejo </PERSON>. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said the department was investigating reports that police stayed away from the store even though they knew of the looting. The trouble brewed through the early morning hours Tuesday, and firefighters were called to the store a second time when another fire was set, <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said. The melee broke out in full Tuesday evening, when about 20 or 30 men flipped and set afire two cars that police have been told were owned by relatives of <PERSON> Albaladejo </PERSON>. About an hour later, when an officer responded to an unfounded call about a burglary, an empty beer bottle was thrown through the rear window of his cruiser, <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said. For five hours, up to 200 people milled around the neighborhood, some drinking, some firing shots into the air, <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said. During the riot, uniformed police pulled out and plainclothes negotiators went in to talk with community leaders and restored calm. In January 1987, <PERSON> Ortiz </PERSON> posted $ 100,000 bail after being charged with murder, <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> said. In March, he was arrested for possession with intent to deliver drugs and freed on $ 3,500 bail. More than 60 people were killed in drug-related violence this summer in <LOCATION> Philadelphia </LOCATION>, including a 5-year-old boy whose death triggered a wave of anti-drug protests.

<TEXT>
 The last time <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> debated on television, it was n't exactly a national media event. But now the two are rival vice presidential candidates and their performances next week could influence this year's presidential election. Even as argument continues over who won the debate between <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, the two campaigns are priming their running mates for next Wednesday's scrap in <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Neb </LOCATION>. They're also trying to move public opinion to receive their candidates favorably. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> returned to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> on Wednesday night to begin cramming for the 90-minute battle. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> planned to finish his latest campaign trip on Friday in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, and then go to back to his native <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> on Sunday for final preparations. They're both reading briefing books, reviewing video tapes, huddling with top staff and getting tips on talking to the cameras. Although the two men disagree over many policies, the main issue at stake in the debate is <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, who the Democrats contend is not qualified to be next in line to the oval office. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has said `` the notion of ` President <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>' is a very, very troubling notion.'' `` I'll tell you, if they were elected, I'd pray for the good health of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> every night,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said Wednesday, trying to persuade voters who are leaning toward <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> that they ca n't risk <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> defends his choice, saying in Sunday's debate: `` I see a man who is young and I'm putting my confidence in a whole generation of people that are in their thirties and their forties.'' Republicans are more than happy to downplay <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s chances of surviving a debate with <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>. `` I do n't think there's a lot of pressure on Sen. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> because frankly a lot of people have gotten out there and gotten his expectations so low that I do n't think they could be much lower,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s campaign chief. `` We'll be ready for the debate,'' <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> told reporters. <PERSON> Rich </PERSON> <PERSON> Bond </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s deputy campaign manager and political director, said he expects the candidates will not `` concentrate their fire at each other but at the top of the ticket.'' `` <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> will probably ask <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> to join him in debating <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> because they have so much in common,'' he said. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> `` ca n't really debate <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> on the issues. He has to defend <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s position because most of them are his own. I think he will squirm,'' said <PERSON> Sheila </PERSON> <PERSON> Tate </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s spokeswoman. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s campaign director, said <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s record will matter as the Democrats try to show `` that our team is better than their team. The <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign contends that <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s differences with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> show that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> did n't want a `` clone'' for a running mate. The low expectations for <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> have worried the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign, because if they're too low <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> could win simply by surviving the debate without any major gaffes. So, alongside a continual knocking of <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, the Democrats are trying to portray him as an able debater with years of practice in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. Privately, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s aides say they're worried <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, 67, will look and sound old compared with the 41-year-old <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. The Republicans at least imply the same thing. `` The contrast between <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> is going to be great,'' said <PERSON> Tate </PERSON>. `` Quayle represents the new generation of leadership, he's bright and engaging.'' The <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> campaign, trying to refute the expectations imbalance, points to the April 22 broadcast of public television's <ORGANIZATION> MacNeil </ORGANIZATION> @ Lehrer NewsHour, during which <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> and <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> debated the issue of giving workers 60 days' notice before a plant could be closed <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> eventually lost the battle on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor, but on television he presented his case attractively. The <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign reviewed that videotape before picking <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> as <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s adversary. <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Ailes </PERSON>, the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign's top media adviser, watched that tape and will be coaching <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> traveled this week with his briefing books and with extra staff from the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign, carving out time from his schedule to watch tapes of <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, including his 1980 debates with Sen. <PERSON> Birch </PERSON> <PERSON> Bayh </PERSON>, whom he defeated to first win election to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. That work will be expanded on the weekend in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> and then in <LOCATION> Austin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> will travel Sunday and work until Tuesday when he goes to <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION>. Democratic Rep. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Eckart </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> plans to play <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> for <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s preparation. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> is receiving issues briefings from Republican staff of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> and from GOP experts such as Labor Secretary <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> McLaughlin </PERSON> and former Secretary of State <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON>. In mock debates, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> is using Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Packwood </PERSON>, R-Ore., a long-time colleague of <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>

 The Nobel Committee today awarded the 1988 Nobel Peace Prize to the blue-bereted <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping forces patrolling the front lines of the world's trouble spots. The committee cited the troops for building a confidence in the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> that allows it to play a growing role in global affairs, and for reducing warfare. `` There is great joy,'' said <PERSON> Timor </PERSON> <PERSON> Goksel </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interim </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. `` The international community has finally given appropriate recognition to all the sacrifices our people have made,'' he told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Naqoura </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> said `` the <ORGANIZATION> Nobel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> recognizes that the quest for peace is a universal undertaking involving all the nations and peoples of the world.'' <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Egil </PERSON> <PERSON> Aarvik </PERSON> said President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> had been `` seriously considered'' for the prize. He did not explain the committee's decision but indicated the presidential election may have been a factor. `` Everything was taken into consideration,'' he said. Nearly 10,000 peacekeepers from more than 30 countries serve under the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> flag from the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> to the Indian subcontinent. Peacekeepers most recently were dispatched to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> under a cease-fire negotiated in the countries' 8-year-long war The decision was widely regarded as an indirect award to <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON>, who scored diplomatic breakthroughs this year in mediating the Iran-Iraq cease-fire, a Soviet withdrawal from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and progress in talks on southwest <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> was ineligible for this year's prize because he was nominated after the Feb. 1 deadline. <PERSON> Aarvik </PERSON> told reporters he hoped the award would `` give the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> and the forces increased prestige.'' The image of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> has recently been enhanced by its role in the recent cease-fires and peace talks, although it suffers financial problems. However, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has said it will pay $ 188 million of the money it owes the world body. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeepers radioed word of their shared victory to battalions in battle-scarred <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and cracked open bottles of champagne in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> to celebrate. The five-member committee praised the forces in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, the subcontinent and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> for subduing tensions where armistices have substituted for peace. The citation said the peacekeepers `` have played a significant role in reducing the level of conflict even though the fundamental causes of the struggles frequently remain.'' <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping officials in <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION>, which contributes more troops than any other country, said they hoped the Nobel Peace Prize would induce members to pay their bills for the financially ailing forces. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> is in arrears in payments to countries which provide soldiers for the peacekeeping forces. It owes <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION> $ 22.5 million. It was the fifth time that a U.N.-related body won the coveted prize since it was first awarded in 1901 from the estate of <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Nobel </PERSON>, the inventor of dynamite. It was the 16th time that an organization rather than a person was named the Peace Prize laureate. <PERSON> Aarvik </PERSON> said he expected <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> to come to <LOCATION> Oslo </LOCATION> to accept the award at the annual ceremony on Dec. 10, the anniversary of Nobel's death in 1896. Nobel built a fortune from his invention and marketing of explosives. The first <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> troops were sent to monitor the armistice between <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Arab </LOCATION> <LOCATION> states </LOCATION> in 1948. Today, most <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> forces are stationed in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. The committee singled out the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interim </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forces </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, which has suffered more than 200 casualties since it was sent to <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>'s southern border region with <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> in 1978. Pvt. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahony </PERSON>, 26, of <PERSON> Cork </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, said he hoped the award would make their job easier in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. `` I feel proud. I suppose we'll get more respect now,'' <PERSON> Mahony </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> Lt. Col. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, who headed a 76-member <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> observer group in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> attached to <ORGANIZATION> UNIFIL </ORGANIZATION>, is one of nine American hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, 43, was seized Feb. 17. His pro-Iranian kidnappers, the underground Organization of the Oppressed on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>, said April 21 that he was to be tried on charges of spying for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> have denied the spying charge. The peace prize is the first this year to be announced of the six annual Nobel Prizes. The others for literature, medicine, chemistry, physics and economics will be announced next month in <LOCATION> Stockholm </LOCATION>, the Swedish capital. Each prize carries a cash award of 2.5 million Swedish kronor, or $ 390,000 at today's rate. It is divided among the winners if there is more than one.

<HEAD>Reagan Aide Says President Will Sign New Pentagon Budget Bill</HEAD>
<NOTE>EDs: Leads with 6 grafs to freshen White House reax to defense
authorization bill; picks up 5th graf pvs, The House.</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By TIM AHERN</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is pleased with the latest version of a <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> budget bill similar to one he vetoed last month and plans to sign it quickly, a White House spokesman said today. <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> told reporters the $ 300 billion defense authorization bill passed by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> `` restores the defense spending priorities requested'' by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in a message accompanying the president's veto of an earlier version on Aug. 3. <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> earlier had given congressional figures assurances that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> would sign the revamped authorization bill, and Sen. <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>, D-Ga., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, told his colleagues, `` This bill will be signed. The assurances were conveyed by <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> during a week of closed-door talks with <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON> and other legislators, according to <PERSON> Nunn </PERSON>. `` The president will approve this bill. That was made very clear and definite,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Les </PERSON> <PERSON> Aspin </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Wis </LOCATION>., chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said the bill `` eliminates the major objections to the original bill. We consider this bill a significant victory for the president's commitment to a strong defense.'' The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> voted 369-48 approval of the revised measure Wednesday afternoon. Three hours later, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> passed it, 91-4. Overall, the measure authorizes the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> to spend $ 300 billion in the fiscal year beginning Saturday, the same total as was contained in the bill <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> vetoed Aug. 3. That represents a slight cut from this year's $ 301 billion defense budget. While the new measure contains the same reductions in <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s proposed Star Wars budget as the original legislation, the earlier bill's congressionally mandated restrictions on internal spending in the Star Wars program were removed The Strategic Defense Initiative, as the Star Wars anti-missile research program is formally known, would receive $ 4.1 billion in the bill, compared to the $ 4.8 billion sought by <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and the $ 3.9 billion authorized for this year. The <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> wanted to spend up to $ 330 million of the SDI money on a space-based interceptor weapon, the first stage of an early deployment SDI program. The previous Pentagon bill would have restricted that to only $ 85 million, but the new measure removes that limit. The new bill also removes a restriction on flight testing of `` depressed trajectory'' missiles, which fly relatively low instead of into space as do other long-range atomic weapons. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has none of the weapons under development and no plans for testing, but the Soviets are believed to be developing the weapons. Money to pay for the programs authorized in the bill is part of a separate Pentagon appropriation bill. The measures are the major unfinished items on the congressional agenda as legislators try to wind up their work and quit for the year. The new Pentagon bill also rewrote the complicated spending plan for the MX and <LOCATION> Midgetman </LOCATION> nuclear missiles, two weapons at the heart of a dispute over the future of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s land-based nuclear missile force. The original bill proposed spending $ 250 million each for study of Midgetman and a railroad-based version of the MX and provided another $ 250 million to be used for either program next year by the incoming president. The new bill provides $ 250 million for Midgetman and $ 600 million for the MX-on-rails program, but says no more than $ 250 million of the MX money can be spent before Feb. 15. The remaining $ 350 million could be reallocated by whomever wins the presidency Nov. 8. The bill also includes a 4.1 percent pay raise for the nation's 2.1 million uniformed military personnel Other provisions:

<HEAD>Town Building Memorial To Artificial Heart Recipient Bill
Schroeder</HEAD>
<DATELINE>JASPER, Ind. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Not long after <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Schroeder </PERSON> died two years ago after spending 21 months with an artificial heart, his wife wondered if a little plaque could be erected somewhere in the couple's hometown. The plaque could say something about the spirit of a man with an extraordinary will to live and a willingness to help others do the same. Later this fall, <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Schroeder </PERSON> will get her wish and more. On Nov. 13, she will help dedicate a 13.5-foot high, 4,000-pound stainless-steel sculpture titled `` Gateway to the Heart.'' `` I thought maybe someday there'd be something, but nothing like this. It's really overwhelming,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Schroeder </PERSON> said recently. The memorial, which almost has been completed by <PERSON> Jasper </PERSON> sculptor <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Hagedorn </PERSON>, will be unveiled at the new Bill Schroeder Sports Complex south of the <ORGANIZATION> Jasper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> football stadium. The complex includes softball and soccer fields. <PERSON> Hagedorm </PERSON> says his work is somewhat controversial, but so was <PERSON> Schroeder </PERSON>'s medical experiment. `` It would n't be fitting to just have a bronze statue of <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Schroeder </PERSON>,'' <PERSON> Hagedorn </PERSON> said. What he found more fitting is a sculpture with an arch that represents not only the gateway to the sports complex but also the gateway to <PERSON> Jasper </PERSON>. <PERSON> Hagedorn </PERSON> said the arch signifies <PERSON> Schroeder </PERSON>'s triumph when he returned to his hometown for its annual Strassenfest in August 1985, a year before his death `` This symbolizes what he did and what he accomplished, rather than him as an individual,'' said <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Hedinger </PERSON>, a former classmate of <PERSON> Schroeder </PERSON>'s at Jasper High. `` But it all blends together.'' <PERSON> Schroeder </PERSON>'s classmates, <PERSON> Jasper </PERSON> <PERSON> High </PERSON>'s class of 1950, reunited to visit <PERSON> Schroeder </PERSON> while he was ill in a <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>, hospital, and to raise money to defray his medical costs. They also have raised about $ 15,000 for the memorial, but more is needed for landscaping and other details. <PERSON> Schroeder </PERSON>, who was 54 when he died, lived longer than any other patient with an artifical heart _ 620 days. His death on Aug. 6, 1986, at <ORGANIZATION> Humana </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital-Audubon </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION> was caused by a massive stroke, one of many he suffered after receiving the Jarvik-7 heart on Nov. 23, 1984. `` There's a really wonderful love in this town,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Schroeder </PERSON> said. `` Wherever he is,'' she said of her husband, `` he's happy.''

 Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> observed the successful launch of the space shuttle Discovery today and told a campaign rally, `` <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is back in space.'' The vice president had just completed a campaign speech when the shuttle was launched. He returned to the platform to tell cheering supporters in a town square rally, `` What a good day. We're back in space.'' Earlier, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> sharpened his criticism of Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' tax enforcement proposals, claiming a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> victory in the fall would mean `` a government hand in every pocket and a tax agent in every home.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> accused his rival of wanting to double the number of <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> agents and told his audience, `` I'm not for a program that would give the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> more power than it already has.'' During a bus tour Wednesday of rural <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, the vice president repeatedly accused <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> of seeking to give the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> new and unwarranted powers. No matter that the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> is part of the executive branch of government that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has served for most of the past two decades. The vice president on Wednesday made the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> a prime new campaign target anyway. `` The <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> has many fine and dedicated individuals,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told a rally in <LOCATION> Ottawa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION> `` Even so ... it can be high-handed. Sometimes it seems to treat innocent people as if they were presumed guilty.'' Specifically, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> criticized <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>'s proposals to beef up enforcement of tax collections and for a college loan program that would be paid back through income tax withholding. In a day of relatively light campaigning, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was to attend rallies here and in two <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> cities today: <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clemens </LOCATION> and Grand Rapids. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> accused <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, in his enforcement plan, of wanting to `` give the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> even more power than it already has to go after the people of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' Said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>: `` He wants to squeeze another $ 35 billion bucks out of the taxpayer's pocket. And, even if it were possible, that would mean the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> would have to double the number of their employees to a total of over 200,000 and that is the equivalent of 20 army divisions.'' `` I do not want to create an auditor army of <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> agents,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told the <LOCATION> Ottawa </LOCATION> rally. `` Faced with that kind of threat, the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people will need a conventional defense initiative to defend themselves against all these <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> auditors.'' The <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign countered that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was overstating the number of <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> agents under the Democrat's plan. A statement said the plan calls for an average 6 percent annual growth in <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> personnel, not a 100 percent increase. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> vowed that, if elected, he would resurrect a so-called `` Taxpayer Bill of Rights'' previously advocated, without success in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>, by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. The proposed `` bill of rights'' would require the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> to inform taxpayers of what rights they have during audits, among other features. Earlier, in a speech to students at <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> at </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Normal </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> criticized a <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> student loan plan that would call for repayment of the loan depending on an individual's later earning powers Loan installments would be automatically added to tax withholding, under the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> plan. `` We do not need to put the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> on your tail for the rest of your life,'' he said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s bus tour in the company of country music singers <PERSON> Loretta </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> and <PERSON> Crystal </PERSON> <PERSON> Gayle </PERSON> took him through northern and central <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>. While on the bus, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and Ms. <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> compared notes of the hazards of appearing in public. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> asked her if she had trouble with hecklers and drunks. `` Are you kidding? I've had guns thrown up on the stage,'' Ms. <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> said. `` Was that a sign of respect?'' the vice president joked.

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Du </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> said today it will begin commercial production in 1990 at <LOCATION> Corpus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Christi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, of a substitute refrigeration chemical for one of the major ozone-destroying chlorofluorocarbon compounds. The new compound is HCFC-134a, long has been considered by industry as a potential substitute for CFC-12 used in auto air conditioners, home and commercial refrigerators and freezers and chillers for large building air conditioners. Though several other <ORGANIZATION> CFC </ORGANIZATION> substitutes have been announced by chemical companies, this is the first for a market that <ORGANIZATION> Du </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pont </ORGANIZATION> says represents about 40 percent of the 330,000 tons of CFCs consumed annually in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. Major nations agreed last year to cut production of important ozone-destroying <ORGANIZATION> CFC </ORGANIZATION> compounds by 50 percent in 1998, and the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> on Monday said it now believes their use should be ended completely. Chlorine liberated from these compounds has been blamed by scientists for depleting the ozone high in the atmosphere that shields the Earth from the sun's ultraviolet rays. Since HCFC-134a contains no chlorine, it can not destroy ozone in the stratosphere when it breaks up, as CFC-12 does. <ORGANIZATION> DuPont </ORGANIZATION>, which has three small plants producing HCFC-134a for research, said it would spend more than $ 25 million on the Corpus Christi installation to make unspecified `` millions'' of pounds of HCFC-134a annually.

 The jury in the handgun trial of syndicated columnist <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON> indicated today it is so far deadlocked on a verdict. The 12-member panel, which has now reviewed the matter for more than five hours over two days, sent <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON> Sr. a note saying a unanimous verdict has not yet been reached. <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON> directed the jury to resume deliberations. <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON>, a longtime advocate of strict handgun control, was charged with using an unregistered pistol and ammunition to wound 18-year-old <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> of suburban <LOCATION> Chevy </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Chase </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, who had taken an unauthorized swim in <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON>'s pool. If convicted of both misdemeanor charges, the 63-year-old <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON> could face up to two years in jail and a $ 2,000 fine. <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON>'s attorneys built their case on a little-used legal principle called `` entrapment by estoppel.'' The principle holds that a person can not be convicted if he is prosecuted for following advice given him by a government official. <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON> has maintained that his son, <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, was rebuffed by police officials when he attempted to register the weapon that was used in the June 14 shooting. <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON>'s son, a former <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent, testified that city police told him he was exempt from the registration requirements because he was a law enforcement officer, and that others in his family could have access to the gun as well. `` He -LRB- <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> -RRB- was depending upon the competence and intelligence of those people that the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> put there -LRB- to advise citizens on gun registration -RRB-,'' argued <PERSON> Raoul </PERSON> <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON>, <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON>'s attorney. `` He was entirely at the mercy of the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>.'' During his two-day trial, <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON> took the stand to say he obtained the weapon in 1982 after receiving a series of death threats from people purporting to be members of the <ORGANIZATION> Ku </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klux </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klan </ORGANIZATION>. Mindful of the charges of hypocrisy leveled at him because of his strong anti-gun position, the columnist also said his son had to persuade him to arm himself. `` I had never had a gun in this house,'' <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON> told the jury. `` We -LRB- <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON> and his son -RRB- got into a little hassle about how sometimes you can let your idealism go so far that you get killed.'' <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON> said his fears were compounded by frequent intrusions by area teens who held late-night pool parties, usually with alcohol and drugs, in his yard. Police officers who investigated the shooting testified that a door at the rear of <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON>'s home showed signs that someone had tried to break in. One officer also testified that the police investigation revealed <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> had been shot at close range just outside <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON>'s home. <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON> maintained that he shot <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> because he was afraid the intruder was trying to enter the house. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said he was trying to flee when <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON> shot him.

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>'s military chief Thursday proposed major troop reductions in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> and challenged the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to discuss cutting naval and air forces. `` The transition from unpredictable zigzags in relations between the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> to more normal and stable relations is now under way,'' Marshal <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Akhromeyev </PERSON> said in a prepared speech. `` It appears that a bridge has been erected into the future, to the next <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> administration,'' he said. <PERSON> Akhromeyev </PERSON> made a ground-breaking visit this summer to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, where he toured an American warship and sat in the cockpit of a B-1 bomber. Defense Secretary <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON> later toured Soviet installations. <PERSON> Akhromeyev </PERSON> spoke to scholars and reporters at an annual lecture sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> Stockholm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> in honor of the late Prime Minister <PERSON> Olof </PERSON> <PERSON> Palme </PERSON>. The institute is funded mostly by the Swedish <ORGANIZATION> Parliament </ORGANIZATION>. He said the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> presidency `` was not easy for us.'' But he praised progress on missile reductions and said the Soviets had now destroyed 200 of their medium - and short-range rockets under an agreement signed in December by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has destroyed 29 of its missiles so far. `` What causes concern are the oceans and seas,'' <PERSON> Akhromeyev </PERSON> said. `` The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and some if its allies do not want to extend verification of the confidence-building measures to the navies and air forces where they have a superiority over the U.S.S.R.'' He cited heavy warships, aircraft carriers, sea-based aircraft and tactical strike aviation, as areas of Soviet disadvantage. <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact navies `` also possess substantial strike capabilities,'' he acknowledged without going into detail. <PERSON> Akhromeyev </PERSON> laid out similar arguments in an article in the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> newspaper Pravda this month, and his speech here seemed intended to step up pressure on the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for naval reduction talks. <PERSON> Akhromeyev </PERSON> promised Soviet openness in counting troops at new talks in <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> on reducing regular forces in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Vienna </LOCATION> talks on Mutual and Balanced Force Reductions in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> have dragged on with little progress for 15 years, mainly because the opposing alliances do not trust each other's estimates of how many soldiers they have. When a planned new format for the talks is set, `` we propose not merely a data exchange, but also thorough verification, including on-site inspections, at any time convenient for the parties after the beginning of the talks,'' <PERSON> Akhromeyev </PERSON> said. Both alliances should reduce troops by 25 percent or a total of 500,000 men as a further step, he said. Other reductions should follow `` to make the character of the armed forces of the alliances generally defensive,'' he said. According to Western estimates, the <LOCATION> Warsaw </LOCATION> Pact holds a 3-to-1 advantage in tanks and artillery and nearly a 2-to-1 edge in combat aircraft and troops, including reserves in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Western officials have expressed doubts about the Soviet emphasis in public statements on defensive strategy. <PERSON> Carlucci </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> in August, said he had `` difficulty in reconciling'' Kremlin claims of a defensive strategy with its high military spending and offensive weapons stocks.

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Emperor <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> received blood transfusions for the seventh straight day Thursday, and a citizen's group marched to protest media portrayals that the entire nation sympathizes with the ailing monarch. The 87-year-old <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> was given two transfusions Thursday, a palace spokesman said, bringing to 7.7 pints the amount he has received since internal hemorrhaging caused him to vomit blood Sept. 19. `` Fortunately, his majesty has been in stable condition, though I as chief court physician am always attentive,'' <PERSON> Kenji </PERSON> <PERSON> Maeda </PERSON> was quoted by <ORGANIZATION> Kyodo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> as saying. <PERSON> Maeda </PERSON> said blood in the bedridden monarch's bowel discharge Thursday morning prompted the first transfusion. `` I understand the symptom of continuing jaundice is still present,'' <PERSON> Maeda </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s temperature rose from from 98.7 degrees Wednesday evening to 99.8 degrees Thursday night, <PERSON> Maeda </PERSON> said. His temperature flared to 102.6 degrees Saturday, but doctors brought it down with antibiotics. About 150 people belonging to a group called the <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> Citizen's League held a march in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> and criticized <LOCATION> Japanese </LOCATION> media coverage that it said implies the whole nation is watching <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s illness with grave `` We were motivated to hold this rally because we did n't want foreign people ... to think the whole nation of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> is sympathizing with the emperor and worried about his illness,'' said <PERSON> Ryuzo </PERSON> <PERSON> Harada </PERSON>, secretary-general of the organization. He said the emperor's limited role should be further restricted by `` interpreting the Constitution more accurately.'' The postwar Constitution limits him to a largely powerless symbol of state. <PERSON> Satsuki </PERSON> <PERSON> Kase </PERSON>, of the Women's <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>, decried extensive news coverage of the cancellation of sports events and autumn festivals in view of <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>'s serious condition. `` We knew the media were going to give biased coverage on the emperor as ` X-Day' approaches,'' Ms. <PERSON> Kase </PERSON> said. `` But they're making it seem as though if your neighbor cancels plans, you have to as well. A palace official said he did not know if <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> was aware of the cancellations, or whether the monarch was watching television news or reading newspapers. <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON>, the world's longest reigning living monarch, has not taken any solid food for 10 days. His eldest son, Crown Prince <PERSON> Akihito </PERSON>, 54, has taken over all imperial official duties. Palace officials have refused to confirm or deny news reports that <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> has cancer and have urged the media to refrain from such speculation. Nearly 2.5 million people have signed registries at the palace and elsewhwere throughout <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> wishing <PERSON> Hirohito </PERSON> a speedy recovery.

<TEXT>
 House Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> today accused Republicans of pursuing a `` partisan political vendetta'' against him in seeking to investigate him for alleged breaches of confidential information. `` I can take it,'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said. `` As speaker, I'm in the kitchen, and I'm not offering to get out.'' The comments came a day after the Democrat-controlled <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> rejected an effort to turn over classified information for a requested ethics inquiry of whether <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> improperly disclosed a secret <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> operation in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. Wednesday's action, on a party-line vote during a closed-door session, had been mapped out a day earlier in a private meeting of committee Democrats, who hold an 11-6 majority on the panel. Majority members argued that they were under no obligation to provide classified information relevant to <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s disclosure in part because the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> ethics committee, which investigates breaches of confidentiality, had not formally asked for the material, said sources who spoke only on condition of anonymity. Chairman <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Stokes </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, pointedly reminded committee members as the meeting broke up that the rules prohibit members from discussing anything done in secret session. The reminder angered some Republican members, who complained that they apparently were being put under stricter rules than the speaker and vowed not to let the matter drop. `` It's extremely ironic that we're so concerned about the committee procedures ... when there's something before <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on keeping the secrets of the nation,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Lungren </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Calif </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, told reporters last week that he had `` clear testimony'' from the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agents had sought to provoke demonstrations and civil unrest that would lead to harsh crackdowns by the leftist Sandinista government The aim, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> contended, was to sabotage faltering peace talks between the government and the Contra rebels. In a subsequent interview, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said the information had been given by the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> under congressional questioning. But he later denied violating House rules, contending the information he had relayed already was publicly known. The disclosure prompted <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Minority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Michel </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ill </LOCATION>., and <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> member Rep. <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Wyo </LOCATION>., to formally ask for ethics and intelligence investigations into whether <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> had violated House rules against divulging classified Today, <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> called the request for an investigation politically motivated. `` It is really very sad that people will try to use the ethics committee, or any other committee of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, as a cat's paw to try to carry out a partisan political vendetta against another member,'' he said. He said he had `` personally dissuaded'' Democrats who had come to him `` trying to use the ethics committee to cast aspersions against at least five <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> members, three of them in the leadership.'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> did not name the targets. `` I talked them out of it, and they have n't done it,'' he said. Asked whether Wednesday's action by the intelligence panel effectively closed the matter, a grim-faced <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> responded: `` Not as far as I'm concerned.'' It appeared that <PERSON> Democrats </PERSON>, in seeking to head off the investigation, had traded <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s potential rules and ethics problems in the incident for political trouble. Republicans indicated they would seek first to have the ethics committee, formally called the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct, make a direct request for the information. That committee is made up of six Democrats and six Republicans. If that effort fails, there could be an attempt to raise the matter on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> floor and further embarrass <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> lawmakers confirmed. The speaker already is under investigation by the ethics committee on a variety of allegations that he improperly profited from his official position and that he improperly intervened with federal regulators on behalf of constituents. The House on Wednesday approved a $ 550,000 boost in the panel's budget to pay for the mounting costs of that investigation. The controversy over <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s disclosure appeared also to have doomed the prospects for legislation to tighten <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' control over administration covert actions. The bill, an outgrowth of last year's Iran-Contra hearings, would require the administration to let <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> know within 48 hours of any covert action it undertakes. But the measure, which already has been passed by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>, appeared to have slipped off the House schedule. `` We might have to address that next year,'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said when asked about the legislation Wednesday. Rep. <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Hyde </PERSON>, R-Ill., the senior Republican on the intelligence panel, said he was frustrated by the rules and admonition that kept members from talking about Wednesday's action But he implied the committee's majority had set out to block any investigation of <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>. `` What's at stake is not simply the persona of the speaker, but whether we should even have an intelligence committee,'' <PERSON> Hyde </PERSON> said. `` ... The issue is there. Something has happened that calls for a reaction by the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>.'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> had been predicting that the request for intelligence and ethics probes of him on the issue would be dropped by the panels, saying the issue was without merit.

 Radical students screaming `` Down with the Olympics!'' bombarded riot police with hundreds of firebombs Thursday, and security was increased to prevent attacks at the Games. About 1,000 students clashed with police at <ORGANIZATION> Korea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in the worst street clash since the Olympics began Sept. 17. Fighting erupted after protesters staged a rally to demand the release of a jailed student leader. Radical leaders said they would disrupt the Olympics before they end Sunday if police do not release Oh Young-shik, who was charged Tuesday with violating national security laws for organizing anti-government demonstrations. Authorities have further increased the tight security for the Games to block possible student attacks. At <ORGANIZATION> Korea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, waves of charging students pelted riot troopers with rocks and firebombs that exploded in showers of blazing gasoline. Riot police tried to deflect the missiles with shields, but the clothes of many caught fire. `` Down with the dictators' Olympics!'' and `` Yankee go home!'' radicals yelled as they charged hundreds of riot police blocking streets with shields. Radical leaders charge the government of President <PERSON> Roh </PERSON> <PERSON> Tae-woo </PERSON> is using the Olympics to impose authoritarian rule and had demanded that communist <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> be a host for the Games along with the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>. They are also demanding that the 42,000 <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> troops stationed in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Korea </LOCATION> be withdrawn. Police martial arts squads with batons charged the students, beating and kicking some protesters. The students pushed back the police several times. Some police and students were injured by firebombs and rocks, but police had no casualty figures and no reports of arrests. The fighting was confined to the streets in front of the school in northeastern <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION>, about 15 miles from where the Games are being held. The students, who also came from other <LOCATION> Seoul </LOCATION> colleges, blocked the main road near the university and tore down part of the school's walls. Firemen tried to douse exploding firebombs with hoses, but students drove the security forces off with missiles, and police hosed the clothing of troopers set on fire. The police hurled stones and rocks at the students, but could not fight them with tear gas, which the government has banned during the Olympics to try to preserve peace. Radical leaders said they would disrupt the end of the Olympics, but security officials said they are taking no chances. The <ORGANIZATION> Chosun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ilbo </ORGANIZATION> newspaper reported in its Friday edition that authorities deployed 36,000 police to guard the mens' marathon on the last day, and special checks were being made along the route for bombs. During the Olympics, only small groups of students have turned out for the mostly peaceful protests and most South Koreans are critical of the dwindling radical movement.

 The Panchen Lama, the No. 2 spiritual leader of <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION>, has urged his superior, the <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON>, to return to <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, according to a newspaper report Thursday. But the <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON>, in <LOCATION> Helsinki </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION>, denied Thursday that he was in contact with the Panchen Lama. `` I have not spoken to the Panchem Lama for at least a year,'' the <PERSON> Dalai </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON> told The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. He appeared bewildered by the <PERSON> Panchen </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON>'s statement that they were in direct telephone contact. In an interview with the official <ORGANIZATION> China </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Daily </ORGANIZATION>, the <PERSON> Panchen </PERSON> <PERSON> Lama </PERSON> also said a new commission on Tibetan <ORGANIZATION> Buddhism </ORGANIZATION> will be set up this year. The body purportedly will give Tibetan Buddhists, who have long chafed under Chinese sectarian rule, more autonomy in religious affairs. The interview came on the eve of the first anniversary of violent anti-Chinese protests in the Tibetan capital of <LOCATION> Lhasa </LOCATION> and underscored <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> attempts to head off further trouble by adopting a conciliatory stance toward <LOCATION> Tibet </LOCATION>.

During his visit this year, Foreign Minister <PERSON> Qian </PERSON> <PERSON> Qichen </PERSON> will continue talks with the Soviets on the main obstacle to normalizing relations _ <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>'s occupation of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>, said ministry spokesman <PERSON> Jin </PERSON> <PERSON> Guihua </PERSON>. `` We hope that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> will make concrete efforts for an early settlement of the Kampuchea -LRB- <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> -RRB- question,'' <PERSON> Jin </PERSON> told a news conference. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is the main ally of <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION>, which invaded <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> in 1978 and ousted the Chinese-supported <ORGANIZATION> Khmer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rouge </ORGANIZATION>. The Soviets said their foreign minister, <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>, will visit <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> but gave no date. The Soviet and Chinese Communist regimes split in the early 1960s over ideological differences and rivalry for leadership of the world communist movement. Although they retained formal diplomatic relations, their leaders have not met since <PERSON> Nikita </PERSON> <PERSON> Khruschev </PERSON> visited <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> <PERSON> Tse-tung </PERSON> in 1959. That also was the last time a Soviet foreign minister came to <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. Foreign Minister <PERSON> Huang </PERSON> <PERSON> Hua </PERSON> attended Soviet leader <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>'s funeral in 1982, but the last working visit to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> by a <LOCATION> Chinese </LOCATION> foreign minister was in 1956. The announcement Wednesday at the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> that <PERSON> Qian </PERSON> would go to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> this year was seen as a clear signal that both countries expect to normalize relations soon. A specific date for <PERSON> Qian </PERSON>'s visit was not set. `` There is a lot of arduous work to do between -LRB- Qian's visit -RRB- and a meeting of the top leaders of <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Jin </PERSON> said. But he added, `` Of course it can be said that the exchange of visits between the Chinese and Soviet foreign ministers constitutes a step forward towards the meeting between the leaders of the two countries. It is our hope that the two sides will work towards this direction.'' The official <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Herald </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Shanghai </LOCATION>, meanwhile, quoted unidentified diplomats in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION> as saying a Chinese-Soviet summit could be held this year or early next year. It did not say if the diplomats were from one of the two countries or give other details. Qian, 60, spent 10 years in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> as a student and diplomat. He headed <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s negotiations with the Soviets over their disputed border from 1982 until becoming foreign minister in April. His appointment as foreign minister was seen as an indication of the importance <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> placed on its gradually warming relations with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> long has maintained that three obstacles exist to normal relations with <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>: the Soviet presence in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, the heavy Soviet troop presence in <LOCATION> Mongolia </LOCATION> on <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>'s border and the Vietnamese occupation of <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> began pulling out of <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> this year and reduced its troops in <LOCATION> Mongolia </LOCATION> in 1987. In recent months <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> has indicated that only <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> remains a problem. `` The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> must urge <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> to withdraw all its troops from <LOCATION> Kampuchea </LOCATION> -LRB- <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> -RRB- at an early date,'' <PERSON> Jin </PERSON> said. `` The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> is the sole foreign partner of the Vietnamese. The Vietnamese can not fight the war a single day'' with Soviet help. <LOCATION> Vietnam </LOCATION> has an estimated 120,000 troops in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> supporting the regime it set up under <PERSON> Heng </PERSON> <PERSON> Samrin </PERSON> and battling Cambodian guerrillas aided by <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> held their first talks devoted to resolving the <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> issue in August, in <LOCATION> Beijing </LOCATION>. Both sides said afterward they found common ground but that differences remained. Premier <PERSON> Li </PERSON> <PERSON> Peng </PERSON> said this month that a summit can be put on the agenda once the two sides come closer on <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION>. He also said normalization would not mean a restoration of the Chinese-Soviet alliance of the 1950s.

 A <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> anti-abortion group opposing Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' presidential candidacy has mailed copies of his record on abortion to Roman Catholic parishes in 18 states. `` If elected president, he would strongly support and no doubt accelerate the tax funding of abortion throughout <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' according to the literature distributed by the group, known as <ORGANIZATION> Campaign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> DiPersio </PERSON>, the group's leader who runs a heating and ventilation business near <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION>, said he has spent $ 30,000 to publicize the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> record. `` As governor of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has annually provided the taxpayers' money in his budgets for the brutal destruction of 8,000 unborn children by abortion-on-demand,'' the group's literature said. <ORGANIZATION> Campaign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Life </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> America </ORGANIZATION> also wrote: `` Each year, 1,100 minor girls are taken out of state for the purpose of abortion without the knowledge and consent of their parents!'' <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> Dreyfus </PERSON>, spokesman for the state office of <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION>, said <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> law allows girls under age 18 to petition courts for permission to have abortions. If a judge finds that they are `` mature,'' they do not have to have parental permission. <ORGANIZATION> Dreyfus </ORGANIZATION> said girls who receive court permission are free to seek an abortion wherever they want, and he said he did not understand the reference to their being `` taken'' out of state. <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Crawford </PERSON>, a member of the governor's <ORGANIZATION> Statehouse </ORGANIZATION> press staff, said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> `` believes someone's right of choice should not be a function of their economic status.'' In his debate with Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> on Sunday, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said he personally opposed abortion but believed the decision lies with the pregnant woman, `` in the exercise of her own conscience and religious beliefs.'' At a sparsely attended news conference Wednesday on <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Common </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> DiPersio </PERSON> said the group was sending an `` information sheet'' to the `` Respect Life'' committees of 28 <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> dioceses in 18 states.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> took a few moments out to agree on one thing today, praising the successful launch of the space shuttle _ then went back to hammering each other over such down-to-earth issues as toxic waste and tax enforcement. Democrat <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> accused the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration of foot-dragging in cleaning up toxic waste and said chronic polluters `` better vote for Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'' in the November election. Republican <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> renewed his criticism of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' tax-enforcement plan. On Wednesday, during a campaign tour through <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> by bus, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> took aim at <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' plan to step up enforcement efforts against tax cheats, and today he told a rally in Saint <PERSON> Charles </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, that a <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> victory in the fall would mean `` a government hand in every pocket and a tax agent in every home.'' After the launch of the space shuttle Discovery, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> told the cheering crowd, `` The shuttle is launched successfully and <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is back in space.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> told college students at a rally in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> that the launch made it `` a very special morning. ... We're very proud of the astronauts.'' Democratic Vice Presidential nominee <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> watched the launch at the <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Tenn. </LOCATION>, airport, then said, `` It was a spectacular takeoff. OK, Russians, we're back.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, in remarks prepared for delivery today at <ORGANIZATION> Rutgers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brunswick </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is to blame for blocking regulations to reduce lead in the air as well as a plan to control toxic wastes. `` Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s administration has had eight years to clean up toxic wastes,'' said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. `` They've started the cleanup on only 137 sites on the National Priorities List out of a total of 1,200.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> promised that if he is elected `` cleanup will be completed or well under way at every single one of the nearly 1,200 Superfund sites on the National Priorities List by December 1996.'' `` For the foot-draggers and the chronic polluters I have just one message: You better vote for Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> because if I'm elected the game is over,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` Let me say a word about my favorite harbor,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> added, noting that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has criticized cleanup efforts in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor called it the oldest harbor in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> and said, `` People starting throwing things into it more than a century before the <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>. And Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> does n't know what he's talking about because we're cleaning up <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>. And we've had to fight Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and the administration he belongs to every inch of the way.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> rejoined the campaign trail after raising his foreign policy profile by meeting with Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> and other foreign officials. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who used several appearances in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> to decry the `` auditor army'' that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> would create, was continuing a <LOCATION> Midwestern </LOCATION> circuit with rallies in <LOCATION> Saint </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Charles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Mount </PERSON> <PERSON> Clemens </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Grand </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rapids </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mich. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> spoke to schoolchildren in <LOCATION> Nashville </LOCATION> as they awaited the scheduled launch of the space shuttle He urged them to consider becoming `` part of this new generation of space pioneers.'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s Republican counterpart and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> colleague, <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, was returning to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to prepare for next week's vice presidential debate after a several days in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> raised the specter of a much larger <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> during a bus tour of <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> on Wednesday. In the populist ploy, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> accused <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> of wanting to `` give the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> even more power than it already has to go after the people of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.'' `` He wants to squeeze another $ 35 billion bucks out of the taxpayers' pocket,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said in <LOCATION> Ottawa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, claiming the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> would have to double its work force to 200,000 people under <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in order to carry out his proposal to collect billions of dollars in delinquent and evaded taxes. `` I have confidence in the honesty of the <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. At a rally in Normal, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> attacked <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' college-loan proposal, under which funds borrowed for school would be repaid over a long period by deductions from paychecks. `` We do not need to put the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> on your tail for the rest of your life as the reward for a college education,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, as he had done before in discussing U.S.-Soviet relationships, had kind words after the <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> meeting about the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> achievements in relations between the superpowers. `` I made it clear to the foreign minister that I was not here to negotiate or discuss specific proposals,'' said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. `` We have one president and I support President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s effort to move forward on these issues right up to the end of his term in office.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had harsher words for the ethics record of the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration, saying that on his first day as president he would bar top officials who left his administration from lobbying their former agencies as long as he is in office. People are currently forbidden from lobbying their former agencies for one year after leaving office. As <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has recently, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> might tap the Social Security trust fund to help balance the federal budget deficit and recalled <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s 1985 vote against cost-of-living adjustments to Social Security recipients. After urging <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> on Tuesday to renounce his membership in the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> also belonged to Boston-based group that calls for steep cuts in defense spending. As <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> and <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> made their debate preparations, an <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News-Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> poll showed the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> were in the same place they were before Sunday's presidential debate. The post-debate survey of 674 likely voters showed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> with 50 percent and <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> with 46 percent. A 5-point margin of error made the difference statistically meaningless.

 Hurricane <PERSON> Helene </PERSON> kept hanging on with 80 mph winds in the middle of the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> today as forecasters turned their attention to a newly formed tropical depression. National Hurricane Center specialist <PERSON> Gil </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> estimated that <PERSON> Helene </PERSON> would lose its tropical characteristics and degenerate into a low-pressure system sometime today or Friday.

It was moving northeast at close to 35 mph, and posed a threat only to ships. <PERSON> Helene </PERSON> will remain a hurricane as long as its winds stay above 73 mph. Spawned last week near the <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Verde </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> off <LOCATION> west </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, its winds reached 140 mph before the storm veered north. The 16th tropical depression of the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> hurricane season formed Wednesday in the <LOCATION> mid-Atlantic </LOCATION> and was strengthening today.

 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> congratulated the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping forces today for receiving the Nobel Peace Prize and said he was n't disappointed that he had not won. `` No, I did n't deserve it as much -LRB- as they did -RRB-,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told reporters asking about the decision. `` It was an admirable decision,'' the president said of the <ORGANIZATION> Nobel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prize </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>'s grant of the medallion to the peacekeeping force. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> reportedly were among the leading contenders for the award for their efforts on behalf of arms control, including the signing of a treaty eliminating land-based intermediate - and short-range nuclear missiles The president talked about the decision following a Rose Garden cermony honoring businesses involved in charitable works. Earlier, <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Marlin </PERSON> <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said a note was sent to the president in the Oval Office as soon as the announcement of the award in <LOCATION> Oslo </LOCATION> moved on news wires. `` President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> today congratulates the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> for its recognition by the <ORGANIZATION> Nobel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peace </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prize </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> of its peacekeeping work around the world,'' <PERSON> Fitzwater </PERSON> said. `` While the committee praised the peacekeeping efforts in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> and the Indian subcontinent, they have also seen that effort in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, in the Iran-Iraq cease-fire and the prospect for a role in <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>,'' he added.

 A smaller-than-expected crowd estimated at 250,000 cheered from riverbanks and roadsides today as Discovery lifted off on <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s first manned space mission in 32 months. The crowds lining <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> 1 across the <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> from <ORGANIZATION> Kennedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> counted down the final few seconds with a <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> announcer piped in by loudspeaker and broke into shouts of encouragement as Discovery lifted off. They quieted down when the spaceship disappeared behind a layer of clouds, but the yells began again when it reappeared and became louder when the crowds heard the announcement at 2 minutes, 4 seconds after launch that the boosters had separated. Challenger blew up 73 seconds into flight because of a flaw in its right booster. `` Oh my Gosh, it was great,'' said 11-year-old <PERSON> Tommy </PERSON> <PERSON> Mathis </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>. `` it was neat watching ... it just looked like a ball of fire at first going up. And it went into a cloud halfway up. `` As soon as it went out, it was beautiful,'' he said. Tens of thousands of people had pitched their tents, parked their campers and pulled out their lawn chairs starting Wednesday to grab the best viewing spots. But <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> estimates of up to 1 million spectators proved to be vastly overblown. <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Heller </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the <LOCATION> Brevard </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff's office said shortly after launch that she guessed about a quarter-million people were on hand, although no formal count is attempted. `` It's about the same size or smaller than the first launch, larger than the most recent launches, but not nearly as big as anticipated,'' she said. No arrests or major traffic problems were reported at launch time, but at dawn traffic was backed up considerably on roads leading to the space center. At dawn highway embankments were teeming with spectators searching for breakfast and setting up binoculars and camera stands. Some even parked illegally outside one of the center gates, risking having their cars towed. `` It's going to work this time,'' <PERSON> Doug </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, 22, of <LOCATION> Wilton </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Conn. </LOCATION>, said Wednesday outside a tent he and a friend set up in a field across the Indian River from the Kennedy Space Center. `` We want to see it.'' `` It's almost like it's starting all over again,'' said <PERSON> Dean </PERSON> <PERSON> Lax </PERSON>, 21, a senior at <ORGANIZATION> Emory </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Riddle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Daytona </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>. Lax and fellow student <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Reilley </PERSON>, 27, saw the Challenger explosion from their campus, a 50-minute drive north of the space center. They pitched a tent in a field Wednesday morning to be on hand for Discovery. In addition to the public, about 3,000 VIPs including movie stars and members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> planned to watch from a site on the space center grounds. A record 5,000 journalists sought accreditation to cover the launch, but only 1,800 were being allowed at the main press site. The rest were moved further away from the launchpad because of safety concerns. Campers lined many stretches of road shoulder along <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> 1 in <LOCATION> Titusville </LOCATION>, and souvenir stands and portable toilets were put up on all major highways. Health officials set up nine first aid tents along the highways expected to be most crowded, said Buddy Render, a battalion chief with <ORGANIZATION> Brevard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fire </ORGANIZATION> and Rescue. Render said minor injuries _ cuts, bruises, dehydration _ would probably be all health workers would have to deal with but `` we're prepared for any kind of mass casualty incident.'' Two hospitals were on emergency standby with extra personnel scheduled. <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Richman </PERSON>, the space center's chief of visitor services, had estimated Wednesday that up to 1 million people would show up. He said hat figure was based on attendance at previous launches, the midmorning scheduling of the launch and increased interest in the shuttle because of Challenger and the long grounding of the space program. `` We've been getting calls from all over the country,'' he said. <PERSON> Barney </PERSON> <PERSON> Barnes </PERSON>, a 68-year-old retired <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> pilot from <LOCATION> Paradise </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, said watching the shuttle would be like watching the flag waving. His wife, <PERSON> Nita </PERSON>, 67, agreed. `` It just gives you goosebumps,'' she said Wednesday as the couple sat outside their camper in a <LOCATION> Titusville </LOCATION> field with a clear view of the distant launch pad. <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> and <PERSON> Norma </PERSON> <PERSON> Perkins </PERSON> came from the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> suburb of Homewood to watch Discovery's launch. The couple, who have seen three or four other shuttle launches, said the experience was `` very, very special.'' `` Brings the tears to your eyes,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Perkins </PERSON>, 63. `` It really does. You know, your heart just kind of stops.''

 An unemployed <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> man whose lack of health insurance was cited by Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in the presidential debate with Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> is returning a $ 400 check <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s nephew sent him to buy insurance <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> Strickland </PERSON>, 42, who lost his job two years ago when his <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> energy company moved, said he was upset with the check because he found it degrading. `` When I first opened it up, I felt kind of proud,'' <PERSON> Strickland </PERSON> said Wednesday at a news conferenee organized by <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> staffers. `` But the more I read the letter, the more I believed that man had no concern for me, my son or my family. His main purpose was a political ploy. As an individual, I'm tired of being used as a political football on this issue.'' The check was sent by <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON><PERSON> , </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> insurance broker, who is a nephew of <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the vice president's wife. <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> on Wednesday denied the check was politically motivated. He said he was responding only to <PERSON> Strickland </PERSON>'s needs. `` I'm a little upset about it all,'' <PERSON> Pierce </PERSON> said. `` My intentions were personally motivated and emotionally driven. I'm sorry that he thought they were politically motivated, because they were n't. <PERSON> Strickland </PERSON> told <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> a week ago during a campaign stop at a <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> hospital that he could not allow his 11-year-old son to play sports in school because he did not have health insurance and could not afford to buy any. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> on Sunday said <PERSON> Strickland </PERSON>'s son could not play Little League because of a lack of insurance.

 <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> has reopened its embassy in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> and stationed two diplomats there in a major step toward improving relations with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, a senior Iranian diplomat said Thursday. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> said they will establish full diplomatic relations. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> will open an embassy in <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION> to be headed by a charge d'affairs and a <LOCATION> Cypriot </LOCATION> ambassador will be accredited to <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>, the two countries announced. <PERSON> Mohammad </PERSON> <PERSON> Faroughy </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s charge d'affaires in <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION>, told <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> that relations between the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> neighbors were warming following the Aug. 20 cease-fire in the Iran-Iraq war. <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> repeatedly had accused <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> of directly aiding <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> in the 8-year-long conflict. <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> expelled five Iranian diplomats last September, reducing <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s embassy staff to Faroughy and an aide, after mobs stormed the <ORGANIZATION> Kuwaiti </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> following riots in the holy city of <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>. But <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> stopped short of actually severing ties with <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> as <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION> did later, citing Iranian subversion and terrorism. Well informed sources said the <LOCATION> Kuwaiti </LOCATION> diplomats in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> are a charge d'affaires and a counselor, putting Kuwaiti representation on a par with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s. The improvement in relations is part of a trend set in motion by <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>'s July 18 unconditional acceptance of the U.N.-sponsored cease-fire and peace talks to end the war. <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> have restored ties with the Islamic republic, and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> is moving in that direction. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> still has no relations with <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, which held 52 Americans hostage in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Embassy in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION> from November 1979 to January 1981. Relations between <LOCATION> Kuwait </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> hit their lowest point in August 1987 after more than 400 Moslem pilgrims, 275 of them Iranians, were killed in what the Saudis said was Iranian-inspired rioting in <LOCATION> Mecca </LOCATION>. Iranian mobs stormed the Saudi and Kuwaiti missions in <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>.

 A rescue convoy stood by at the shuttle's <LOCATION> Mojave </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Desert </LOCATION> landing site in case of an emergency today, but once Discovery reached orbit the ground crew settled down to prepare for the scheduled touchdown in four days. The shuttle is to complete its mission with a landing here Monday morning on the hard, clay-like surface of <ORGANIZATION> Rogers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lakebed </ORGANIZATION>, but `` We're ready to support a landing anytime during the mission,'' <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Nancy </PERSON> <PERSON> Lovato </PERSON> said Wednesday. The lakebed is the prime site for an earlier emergency landing, including what the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> calls an abort-once-around, a landing after one low orbit spurred by a premature shutdown of the main shuttle engines following launch. `` The only reason they would n't come here -LRB- for an abort-once-around -RRB- would be weather _ if there were flooding -LRB- of the lakebed -RRB- or severe winds,'' said <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Franklin </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Donnell </PERSON>. But the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> forecast sunny skies, temperatures climbing to near 90 degrees and winds up to 17 mph for today _ acceptable conditions for an emergency landing here. Bad weather here during an abort-once-around would force the shuttle to land at <LOCATION> White </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sands </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.M. </LOCATION>, or back at the Kennedy Space Center launch site in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. Loss of two main engines soon after launch would dictate a trans-Atlantic abort landing at <PERSON> Ben </PERSON> <PERSON> Guerir </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Morocco </LOCATION>; Moron, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>; or <LOCATION> Banjul </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Gambia </LOCATION>. A shutdown of the engines even earlier might require a return-to-launch-site landing in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. A 110-person recovery convoy of <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> rescuers was ready to wait out the launch in <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s shuttle operations area here, then drive numerous rescue and service vehicles onto the lakebed if an emergency landing was needed, <PERSON> Lovato </PERSON> said. After any landing, technicians check for hazardous vapors around the shuttle orbiter, then connect various cooling and gas-purging lines to the spacecraft. Plans call for the shuttle crew to emerge from the orbiter 30 to 40 minutes after landing.

 The crew of the <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lines </ORGANIZATION> plane that crashed last month at the <LOCATION> Dallas-Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Worth </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> gave no indication of trouble in the moments before the crash, according to a tape released today of crew conversations with air traffic controllers. Fourteen people were killed in the crash. A transcript of the air traffic control tower tapes, released by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, showed the <ORGANIZATION> Delta </ORGANIZATION> jetliner took about 22 minutes to taxi from its gate to the point at which it began rolling down the runway on Aug. 31. There was no word from the aircraft, flight 1141 with 107 people on board, between the time the co-pilot acknowledged receiving takeoff clearance and the crash. `` Fire at the end of the runway,'' an unknown voice was heard to say on the tape in the first indication that something unusual had occurred, according to the transcript. Four seconds before the remark and presumably after the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727 already had crashed, someone on the plane attempted to communicate with the tower, but managed only to give the flight number. The two pilots and flight engineer were among those who survived the crash, although all three were injured. At one point someone could be heard saying, `` Flames out of the left side of the engine,'' but <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> officials said that appeared to be a remark picked up by the controller's microphone from someone in the tower. The remark was not included in the official transcript. Federal investigators have ruled out engine failure as a cause of the crash after it was determined that none of the plane's engines had experienced a mechanical failure After the crash, controllers began rerouting incoming aircraft and ordering jets awaiting takeoff to halt in their tracks. `` Emergency equipment rolling?'' an unknown voice asked 55 seconds after the plane's flames were noticed. `` Affirmative,'' replied the controller.

 The federal government, trying to settle a 17-year-old dispute over a sewer grant, has tied up the city's bank accounts. The federal court action Wednesday came just as the city was about to obey another court order and write a check for $ 82,397 to pay firefighters' clothing allowances owed for years. It was the third time this year a court has frozen the city's accounts In a separate matter, a judge today dropped civil and contempt charges against Mayor <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> Officer stemming from an extra $ 80,000 the mayor received from the cash-strapped city. <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clair </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Judge </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> dismissed the charges at the request of county prosecutor <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Baricevic </PERSON>, who would not say why he made the request. <PERSON> Baricevic </PERSON> `` knows he did n't have a case against him,'' said Officer's lawyer, <PERSON> Eric </PERSON> <PERSON> Vickers </PERSON>. At a hearing Aug. 29, <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> had held Officer and <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION> in contempt of court after they failed to provide him with records explaining the $ 80,000 transfer to Officer. <PERSON> Baricevic </PERSON> said Officer got the money between 1984 and last year, in addition to his annual salary of $ 30,000. But two of the mayor's top aides told the judge that many of the city's financial records could n't be found An arson fire at the old City Hall Annex may have been to blame for the problem, said Assistant City Attorney <PERSON> Kenwyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Redding </PERSON>. He also blamed past City Hall workers, whom he did not identify. On Wednesday, city Treasurer <PERSON> Charlotte </PERSON> <PERSON> Moore </PERSON> said she expected to have enough money on hand after paying off the firefighters to write paychecks for city workers for the first time since Aug. 30. But that was before she learned the federal <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> had obtained another freeze on the bank accounts. Officer told a <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> meeting that the city is going to have to chop the payroll. `` We're going to have to cut and cut deep,'' he said. He said the amount sought by the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> will bring the projected city deficit for the rest of the year to $ 700,000. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> Hess </PERSON> said the latest freeze arose out of the misuse of the <ORGANIZATION> EPA </ORGANIZATION> sewer grant. The federal government, which is seeking $ 221,175, contends the city of 55,000 did not act on the project in a timely manner.

 <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>, the head of the commission that investigated the tragic Challenger explosion, said today's successful launch of the shuttle Discovery was `` a wonderful day'' for the space program. <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> and about 2,000 VIPs watching the launch from a special site about 6 -LCB- miles away from the pad hooted and cheered as the shuttle soared through blue sky until it could no longer be seen. `` In my days, the sky was the limit. It's not the limit any more,'' <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> said after the launch. Two relatives of Challenger astronauts also watched the liftoff at Kennedy Space Center from a different location than most of the other VIPs, said <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Arnold </PERSON> <PERSON> Richman </PERSON>, though he was not sure where. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, son of pilot <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, and <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Onizuka </PERSON>, brother of mission specialist <PERSON> Ellison </PERSON> <PERSON> Onizuka </PERSON>, were on hand to watch the first shuttle mission since their relatives were killed along with five other Challenger astronauts on Jan. 28, 1986. At the VIP site, at least one celebrity joined former astronauts and members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> watching the launch from bleachers. Actor <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Travolta </PERSON> told reporters before the launch he was a guest of former astronaut <PERSON> Buzz </PERSON> <PERSON> Aldrin </PERSON>, whom he had met in a movie. Asked if he would like to go into space someday, <PERSON> Travolta </PERSON>, a jet pilot for eight years, said, `` I'd love to.'' <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> set up one VIP viewing area 6 -LCB- miles from the launch pad to accommodate about 2,000 invitees and one nearby to seat about 2,000 more. Special guests of <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> had watched the Challenger liftoff from the same seaside pad from only three miles away, but for safety reasons the space agency limited the number of people allowed that close for today's launch. Officials of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> said about 3,000 special guests sought invitations to the launch, and by Wednesday afternoon, about two-thirds had said they would be there. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Marianetti </PERSON> said the agency does not solicit VIPs to watch the launches. `` They come to us,'' he said. `` We get a lot of criticism when celebrities do come ... but the fact is that most of the people watching -LRB- from VIP areas -RRB- will be average <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> people.'' Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON>, the first <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> to orbit Earth, and Sen. <PERSON> Jake </PERSON> <PERSON> Garn </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Utah </LOCATION>, who flew aboard Discovery in April 1985, watched the launch from the main media site about 4 miles from the pad. Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., the only other member of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> who has flown in space, also was at the space center for the liftoff and was flying back to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> shortly after Several other former astronauts were on the guest list, including Saudi Arabian Sultan <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Saud </PERSON>, who was a payload specialist on one of the shuttle missions. Others who had been expected to attend, including entertainer <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Denver </PERSON>, never arrived. <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>, who wants to ride aboard the Soviet Mir space station, recently spent three days at the <ORGANIZATION> Johnson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> undergoing a medical evaluation given to all astronaut applicants. He was one of several Americans asked by the Soviets to fly in their space program, according to a spokeswoman for <LOCATION> Denver </LOCATION>. Other VIPs watching included Lt.

<HEAD>Navy Needs Electric Propulsion in 21st Century, Admiral Says</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By NORMAN BLACK</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s top admiral has decided <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s next class of warship is going to rely on electricity for propulsion Adm. <PERSON> Carlisle </PERSON> <PERSON> A.H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Trost </PERSON>, in a speech delivered at a classified symposium, announced to industry officials the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> no longer would just dabble in researching `` integrated electric drive propulsion'' but instead would embrace it as the power plant of the future to replace diesel, gas turbine or nuclear propulsion. `` In view of its many well-known advantages, I am declaring that integrated electric drive, with its associated cluster of technologies, will be the method of propulsion for the next class of surface battle force combatants,'' said <PERSON> Trost </PERSON>, the chief of naval operations. `` And I am directing all the major <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> organizations involved in these efforts to concentrate their energies toward that objective. It's something that has stayed in the laboratory too long, and we need to tear down those barriers that have prevented its development.'' With electric drive, a warship would use a conventional engine to power a generator, which in turn would produce electricity for a motor that would turn the propeller shaft. That, in turn, would eliminate the need for reduction gears and other mechanical engine machinery, <PERSON> Trost </PERSON> said. `` Electric drive is an old idea with a remarkable new potential,'' the four-star admiral asserted. `` The advantages we can already see are enormous ... And that's just the basic technology itself.'' Among other benefits, the advent of electric-drive systems would put sufficient electrical-generating capacity on <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> warships to power exotic weapons of the future like lasers and `` directed energy weapons,'' the admiral added. <PERSON> Trost </PERSON> served as the keynote speaker Monday at a two-day symposium sponsored by the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Naval League and held behind closed doors at the Naval Surface Warfare Center at <LOCATION> White </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Oak </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, outside <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The symposium was designed to assess the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION>'s view of what its combat fleet might look like in the 21st century and while closed to the public, the Pentagon release an unclassified version of <PERSON> Trost </PERSON>'s speech on Wednesday. According to Lt. Cmdr. <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Quigley </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, the service has studied electric propulsion for surface warships off and on for years, always devoting relatively small amounts of money to the work. Indeed, <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> ships have been built in the past with electric drive units, but they always left something to be desired in performance, the spokesman noted. The march of technology, however, already has improved performance and more gains can be made, <PERSON> Trost </PERSON> told his audience. A modern, efficient electric propulsion system offers huge savings in weight and manpower along with new flexibility in designing a ship's hull and more room for weapons to be packed aboard, the admiral added. <PERSON> Quigley </PERSON> and other <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officials said they were unaware of any specific new breakthrough or study that might have prompted <PERSON> Trost </PERSON>'s decision The admiral himself, in his speech, cited recent advances in the field of superconductivity, but suggested he mainly was trying to break down institutional barriers to change. `` In other words, we need a firm goal,'' <PERSON> Trost </PERSON> declared. `` This is a case where the benefits of a specific application of technology are so obvious that we need to invert the normal scheme of things.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> is just now beginning to build a new type of surface warship _ the so-called <PERSON> Arleigh </PERSON> <PERSON> Burke </PERSON> class of destroyers _ and thus probably wo n't begin designing another until well into the 1990s.

<TEXT>
 Researchers have isolated and purified a mystery substance they suspect is linked to high blood pressure, an affliction that leaves nearly 60 million Americans at dramatically higher risk of stroke and heart disease, it was announced Thursday. People with high blood pressure are believed to have increased levels of the substance, which researchers have yet to identify, in their blood. Isolation of the compound, which appears only in trace amounts, should speed up identification and manufacture of a synthetic version of the substance to be used in future studies, said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamlyn </PERSON>, an assistant professor of physiology at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Maryland </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>. `` What we think is that having more of it in the circulation may be effectively raising blood pressure,'' said <PERSON> Hamlyn </PERSON>, who has been working to isolate and purify the substance from blood plasma for six years. Once the substance is identified, synthesized and available for wide study, <PERSON> Hamlyn </PERSON> predicted, it will still be at least eight to 10 years before new relief for sufferers of high blood pressure is available. <PERSON> Hamlyn </PERSON> presented his research results at a conference of the American <ORGANIZATION> Heart </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> on High Blood Pressure Research. The study was conducted with scientists from the <ORGANIZATION> Upjohn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which also provided funds for the project. <PERSON> Harvey </PERSON> <PERSON> Gonick </PERSON>, an adjunct professor of medicine at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> at <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> who is working in the same field, called <PERSON> Hamlyn </PERSON>'s development a `` major move in the right direction.'' Identification and synthesis of the substance will have extraordinary implications for treatment of disease, he said. `` There's been a worldwide race ... toward trying to isolate, identify and purify this hormone, and that race is yet to be won,'' said <PERSON> Gonick </PERSON>. `` But he's made a step in the right direction.'' The substance, which has no name, appears to increase the amount of sodium and calcium in cells, <PERSON> Hamlyn </PERSON> said. Sodium and calcium work together to regulate the contraction of muscle cells in blood vessels. When cells are unable to pump out enough sodium, calcium levels go up and tension in the artery wall increases, causing blood pressure to rise. But the association between the mystery substance and blood pressure levels has been difficult to investigate because the material appears in trace amounts, said <PERSON> Hamlyn </PERSON>. One metric ton -LRB- about 2,200 pounds -RRB- of blood plasma typically yields an amount barely visible in the bottom of a test tube, he said. `` No one has been able to measure it very well,'' said <PERSON> Hamlyn </PERSON>, who hopes researchers will be able to identify the material within a year. `` Everything depends on finding out what the substance is.'' Possible strategies for counteracting the substance once it is identified include inhibiting its production, designing a compound to block its effect or accelerating its breakdown in the body, said <PERSON> Hamlyn </PERSON>.

 About 10,000 <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> soldiers in blue helmets and berets are deployed from the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> to the snows of <LOCATION> Kashmir </LOCATION> in peacekeeping operations. The seven <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping and observer operations are based on the principle of minimal use of force. The peacekeepers, who won the 1988 Nobel Peace Prize on Thursday, operate only with the consent of the parties concerned and they are permitted to fire their light arms only in self-defense. The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> soldier is protected not by his weapons, but by nearly universal regard for the impartiality and fairness symbolized by the blue and white <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> logo of the world wreathed by an olive branch. He is not a combatant and he supports neither side in classic no-win situations. He is at home counting withdrawing troops or persuading shepherds to graze their flocks away from sensitive, unmarked borders. But that did n't protect <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Lt. Col. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> observer in southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. He was kidnapped in February by Moslem fundamentalists and was wearing a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> blue beret when he was abducted. The official <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> definition of peacekeeping is an operation involving military personnel, but without enforcement powers, established by the <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> to help maintain or restore peace in areas of conflict. They aim to control conflicts, prevent escalation, patrol buffer zones and create breathing time and space to allow tensions to cool and political peacemaking to operate. `` If you do n't use peacekeepers, then other countries see the threat or the use of force as practical options'' to fill a vacuum, <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Undersecretary-General <PERSON> Marrack </PERSON> <PERSON> Goulding </PERSON> said Thursday. He is in charge of peacekeeping operations. `` Peacekeeping is a revolutionary idea, a major <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> innovation pioneered in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>'' in 1948 and still evolving, said former <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Undersecretary-General <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Urquardt </PERSON>, in charge of peacekeeping for years. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping costs about $ 230 million a year and <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials say that likely additional operations in southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sahara </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> will raise the total to $ 1.5 to $ 2 billion annually. Over the years, about 500,000 <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> personnel have been involved in <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping and observer operations, drawing forces from 58 nations. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> says 733 peacekeepers have lost their lives since 1948. The latest <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping operation was deployed Aug. 20 to supervise a cease-fire in the eight-year Iran-Iraq war. It involves about 1,500 lightly armed soldiers in blue helmets and support personnel in blue berets. Another team of 50 unarmed observers is deployed in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> to monitor a U.N.-mediated <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> agreement calling for pullout of Soviet troops. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping forces and observers are expected to be deployed in southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> this fall, in <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sahara </LOCATION> to supervise elections and in <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> to monitor a Vietnamese troop withdrawal. Other <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping and observer forces operate in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>, in in <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> and along the disputed India-Pakistan border of <LOCATION> Kashmir </LOCATION>. Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> writes in a book on peacekeeping, `` In a time of nuclear armament, it is more than ever important that regional conflicts in sensitive areas should be kept out of the sphere of possible great-power nuclear confrontation. `` I believe that this novel but still fragile creation is an important addition to the armory of peace in the nuclear age. ... It is an indispensable and potentally highly effective weapon in the struggle for world peace.''

 Government troops fired on hundreds of looters in three separate incidents Thursday, killing 18 people and wounding eight, state-run <ORGANIZATION> Rangoon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Radio </ORGANIZATION> announced. The ruling party announced the formation of a new central executive committee and claimed more than half the employees of five ministries have returned from a crippling pro-democracy strike. But a <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> diplomat said Thursday the government workers only planned to pick up their paychecks and were doing little constructive work. The military government has ordered all civil servants workers back to work Monday to end a pro-democracy strike that has crippled <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s government and production, leading to severe food and medical shortages. The strike, which began Aug. 8, has become the most effective form of protest since Gen. Saw <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> led a Sept. 18 coup and brutally suppressed anti-government street demonstrations. On Thursday, 12 people were killed when troops opened fire on a group of about 200 people looting a warehouse at the <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION> port, the radio said. The broadcast said four more died and three were arrested after 100 people tried to loot a Construction Ministry facility in <PERSON> Kaba </PERSON> <PERSON> Aye </PERSON>, north of the capital. The other two casualties were from a looting incident in <LOCATION> Thamaing </LOCATION>, also north of <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>. Diplomats say hundreds of people have been slain and many wounded since the coup. Before Thursday, the government listed about 350 people killed, although the National League for Democracy placed the dead at nearly 1,000. The radio also announced the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> has named 15 leaders of the party, formerly known as the <ORGANIZATION> Burma </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Socialist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Program </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>, to its new central executive committee. Party leaders appointed Tha <PERSON> Kyaw </PERSON> chairman of the new panel, the broadcast said. <PERSON> Tun </PERSON> <PERSON> Yee </PERSON> was named general secretary and Than Tin joint general secretary. All three were top leaders in the earlier party, <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>'s sole political party since 1962. Saw <PERSON> Maung </PERSON> has promised multiparty elections but set no date for the polling. The National League for Democracy, the main opposition alliance, urged workers to ignore the government's order to return to work Monday. They want protesters to remain on strike until democracy is won. But one diplomat based in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Thailand </LOCATION>, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the authorities `` have won for now. There is not much the opposition can really do right now.'' State radio said Wednesday that 74 percent of the <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Planning </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> employees were at work. It said more than half of the employees showed up at the ministries of health, home and religious affairs, and culture and trade. `` A lot of people are going back to work now so they can pick up their paychecks,'' said the <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> diplomat in <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>, who noted that pay comes at the end of the month in <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION>. `` We've had reports of people sitting around drinking tea.'' In <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Children's Fund planned to fly 103 tons of emergency medical supplies and equipment to hospitals in <LOCATION> Burma </LOCATION> to help hundreds of people wounded in anti-government demonstrations. An agency official said the first of six flights will begin Friday from <LOCATION> Bangkok </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Rangoon </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>No Pay Hike for Lawmakers in $1.8 Billion Congressional Spending
Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By ALAN FRAM</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> approved a $ 1.8 billion 1989 appropriations bill for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' own expenses Thursday, an election-year measure devoid of a pay raise that many lawmakers had talked about giving themselves. The measure was approved on a 253-133 vote and sent to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> for final congressional approval. The appropriations bill was one of five remaining that legislators are racing to complete by Saturday's start of federal fiscal year 1989. If all 13 are enacted by Saturday, it would be the first time since 1948 that all of the spending measures that finance government agencies were in place in time for the new year. Members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> have received base annual salaries of $ 89,500 since February 1987. But lawmakers have been coming under increasing public criticism for the large sums of money most of them receive for giving speeches to industry, labor and other groups. The amount of the payments _ called honoraria _ legislators can keep each year can total up to 30 percent of each representative's salary, and up to 40 percent of each senator's pay Lawmakers have discussed lowering or eliminating the amount of honoraria permitted in exchange for increasing the base pay. After House-Senate negotiators working on the bill discussed the proposals briefly on Wednesday, they agreed not to address the issue in the spending measure. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> is scheduled to propose salary adjustments for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> and top federal officials in January. His proposal will be based on the recommendations that a special federal salary commission are scheduled to make in December. The money in the bill represents a 3 percent, or $ 59 million, increase over 1988 legislative spending. Of the total package, $ 506 million is for the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and $ 341 million for the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. The rest is for joint items such as the Capitol Police and for congressional agencies such as the Library of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>.

<TEXT>
 A tearful Mayor <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Knudson </PERSON> spoke for many of <ORGANIZATION> Morton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION>'s 8,000 <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> employees when he called today's successful launch of the shuttle Discovery `` one of the greatest moments of my life.'' Employees at the rocket-maker's <ORGANIZATION> Wasatch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Operations </ORGANIZATION> 25 miles west of here erupted in cheers as they watched the launch on television monitors. <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s return to space followed to 32 months of corporate agony. `` We're all delighted with the launch. There are lot of very happy people here at <ORGANIZATION> Morton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION>.'' said <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Ayers </PERSON>, acting director of finance and administration for space operations. Today's successful launch was in sharp contrast to the Jan. 28, 1986, Challenger disaster which killed seven astronauts. The tragedy was caused by a faulty joint seal on one of <ORGANIZATION> Morton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION>'s 126-foot-long boosters, which allowed a plume of fiery gas to escape, triggering the explosion that doomed Challenger. A pair of the company's redesigned boosters hurtled Discovery spaceward today. The mayor, a dentist, was unable to watch the launch because he was with a patient. But when informed by a reporter it was a success he struggled to speak through his emotion. `` This is one of the greatest moments of my life,'' he said. `` We're not talking jobs here. We're talking emotions, people's sense of worth. He said about two-thirds of <ORGANIZATION> Morton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION>'s 8,000 <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> employees reside in the city and its environs. Hundreds of <ORGANIZATION> Morton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION> officials and engineers were at <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canaveral </LOCATION> for the launch. Reporters were barred from company premises in <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, in part so employees could watch the launch in private, said spokesman <PERSON> Rocky </PERSON> <PERSON> Raab </PERSON>.

 One of the most prominent members of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping forces, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Marine Lt.

An underground group calling itself the Organization of the Oppressed on <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> has claimed responsibility for his abduction, charging he used his <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> uniform to spy for the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. American and <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials denied the charge. The kidnappers, believed to be Shiite Moslem zealots loyal to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, have issued four communiques and a videotape since his abduction, demanding <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s withdrawal from an occupied enclave in south <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. They also demanded the release of all Lebanese and <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> guerrillas held by <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>. None of their demands have been met.

But on July 8, <ORGANIZATION> Palestine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Bassam </PERSON> <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharif </PERSON> said in a published interview that <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> was abducted to thwart a plan hatched to rescue eight other Americans held hostage in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Abu </PERSON> <PERSON> Sharif </PERSON> was quoted by the <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION> daily Ad-Diyar, which is based in <LOCATION> Christian </LOCATION> east <LOCATION> Beirut </LOCATION>, as saying that the <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> obtained `` a transcript of the interrogation with <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>.''

 Six high school dropouts were notified Thursday that they will lose their driver's licenses unless they re-enroll in school, the first teen-agers affected by new education legislation. <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Bolen </PERSON>, director of the state <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vehicles </ORGANIZATION> safety and enforcement division, said letters went Thursday to four boys and two girls. The Legislature earlier this year passed a 300-page bill rewriting much of the state's education law. One provision calls for the suspension or revocation of driver's license privileges for dropouts under 18 years old. `` As far as I know, it's the first in the nation,'' state Schools Superintendent <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> McNeel </PERSON> said Thursday. `` Our bill was the first in the country where a driver's license would be revoked if a person is not in school.'' <PERSON> Bolen </PERSON> said the notification carries a 30-day waiting period before the revocation takes effect. Those notified will lose their licenses Oct. 30 unless they enroll in a general education course to earn a high school diploma, <PERSON> Bolen </PERSON> said. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>'s dropout rate was 17.4 percent last year, down considerably from 27 percent a decade ago, <PERSON> McNeel </PERSON> said. But he said the rate remains too high. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Virginia </LOCATION>'s dropout rate ranked 28th nationally in 1986, the most recent rankings available, state officials said. <PERSON> McNeel </PERSON> said educators are split over the legislation, but he endorses it. `` Being a parent of teen-agers, I believe it has some merit, maybe considerable merit,'' he said. `` It is something the teen-agers value and perhaps many individuals will be convinced to stay in school because of that. It is one of the tools we should use.'' State Delegate <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Harman </PERSON>, a Republican who also is a Mineral County school administrator, objected to the driver's license provision in the education bill, saying some students may need to drop out of school to help their parents earn a living. In addition, <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vehicles </ORGANIZATION> lawyer <PERSON> Wyatt </PERSON> <PERSON> Hanna </PERSON> said his agency's appeals process for license revocations could take years, meaning a student likely would be 18 _ and exempt from the law _ once the final appeal is heard. <PERSON> Bolen </PERSON> said the six students notified live in rural <LOCATION> Pocahontas </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Braxton </LOCATION> counties, in the central and central-east parts of the state. <PERSON> Carolyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Spangler </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, said <PERSON> Braxton </PERSON>'s dropout rate was 22.9 percent and <PERSON> Pocahontas </PERSON>' dropout rate was 15.7 percent School officials notified the <ORGANIZATION> DMV </ORGANIZATION> that the students `` either voluntarily or involuntarily have withdrawn from secondary schools and are under 18 years or age,'' <PERSON> Bolen </PERSON> said. The ages range from a little over 16 to nearly 18. <PERSON> Bolen </PERSON> declined to identify the students, saying he believes they have confidentiality rights and `` I do n't believe it is proper for them to read in the newspapers without getting the notification first from us.'' If the students decline to re-enroll and show proof of that to the <ORGANIZATION> DMV </ORGANIZATION>, they have the right to an administrative appeal and then can resort to the regular court system, <PERSON> Bolen </PERSON> said. `` We'll notifiy them of that,'' he said. <PERSON> Bolen </PERSON> said he expects county schools systems to begin notifying his office on a regular basis about dropouts now that the program has started. He said he has received 34 names from four counties, but just eight of those students had licenses. Two notifications were shelved because the students will be 18 by the time the <ORGANIZATION> DMV </ORGANIZATION> could contact them, he said. <PERSON> McNeel </PERSON> said several states either are considering similar legislation.

 A lawyer representing a 9 -LCB- - year-old girl wants genetic tests done to settle the question of her biological parents, but he wants them done in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> and he wants the results kept secret, at least for now But <PERSON> Marvin </PERSON> <PERSON> Ellin </PERSON>, a lawyer representing a <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> couple who think the <LOCATION> Sarasota </LOCATION> girl may be their biological daughter, said he will seek a court-order Monday to have the sophisticated blood tests conducted by <ORGANIZATION> Johns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hopkins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>. Secrecy for the tests is unacceptable, said <PERSON> Ellin </PERSON>. `` They would n't be able to disclose the fact that she is their daughter, they would n't be able to file evidence of it.'' Negotiations between <PERSON> Ellin </PERSON> and <LOCATION> Tampa </LOCATION> lawyer <PERSON> Dale </PERSON> <PERSON> Swope </PERSON> collapsed Wednesday in a dispute over who will do the testing and the confidentiality of the results. <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> and <PERSON> Regina </PERSON> <PERSON> Twigg </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Langhorne </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION>, claim in a $ 100 million lawsuit that their healthy baby girl was switched at tiny <ORGANIZATION> Hardee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Wauchula </LOCATION> in central <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> with a fatally ill newborn in 1978. Birth records show that only one white girl, the <LOCATION> Sarasota </LOCATION> child, shared the nursery with the <PERSON> Twigg </PERSON> baby, so the case has focused on her. <PERSON> Swope </PERSON>, who represents the girl's father, said the tests must be kept secret. `` If it produces unsettling results, they will be kept confidential until our client has had a chance to explain this tragedy to his child. Then, in time, after she has adjusted to it, we will disclose it to other interested parties.'' The baby the <PERSON> Twiggs </PERSON> took home from the <LOCATION> Wauchula </LOCATION> hospital suffered from a congenital heart defect. The couple nursed the sick girl, <PERSON> Arlena </PERSON> <PERSON> Twigg </PERSON>, through a painful life until she died Aug. 23 following surgery. Tests taken before a heart operation at a <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> hospital indicated <PERSON> Arlena </PERSON>'s blood type was different from theirs. Further sophisticated protein-matchting tests ruled out any biological relationship with the Twiggs.

He said that during the raids, police found documents pointing to financial support from unidentified `` outside sources.'' He did not elaborate. On Tuesday, <PERSON> Biazon </PERSON> said the latest series of arrests `` severely crippled'' recent attempts by subversives to launch another coup attempt. He said more arrests were expected. <PERSON> Biazon </PERSON> told a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Representatives </ORGANIZATION> committee Wednesday that unidentified businessmen and opposition politicians were under surveillance for possible links to military renegades, including former Lt. Col. <PERSON> Gregorio </PERSON> `` Gringo'' <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON>. <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON> led the failed Aug. 28, 1987 coup, in which at least 53 people were killed and 300 were wounded. <PERSON> Matillano </PERSON> was one of <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON>'s lieutenants in the coup attempt. Both were arrested and escaped separately in April. <PERSON> Honasan </PERSON> was chief of security under former <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Minister <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Ponce </PERSON> <PERSON> Enrile </PERSON>, who was fired in 1986 after a failed coup attempt by his followers. Sen. <PERSON> Enrile </PERSON>, vice chaiman of the <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Action </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> oppositon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> party </ORGANIZATION>, denied Thursday he was personally linked to the mutineers and said he was ready to defend himself in court if the government tried to implicate him. Also Thursday, <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Fidel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ramos </PERSON> told a congressional committee that the military estimated about 25,800 Communist rebels were operating nationwide, of whom about 12,800 were armed. The rebels have been waging a 19-year insurgency to establish a Marxist state. In the robbery near <LOCATION> Manila </LOCATION> airport, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Army Capt. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> was offered a ride to his hotel by a woman shortly after he arrived at Ninoy Aquino International Airport from <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> early Thursday, police said. They said the woman told <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> she would charge him less than the regular taxi fee and he agreed. Soon after, she stopped the car, telling <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> she had a flat tire. Four armed men asaulted the American officer, robbing him of his valuables and luggage and driving off with him. They dropped <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> off behind the suburban <ORGANIZATION> Makati </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Medical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> and sped away. He then flagged down police, who pursued the robbers and shot and killed them, police said. It was not known what happened to the woman.

<HEAD>House Approves $46.6 Billion Farm Money Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MIKE ROBINSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The House on Thursday approved a $ 46.6 billion money bill for the nation's farm programs, including for the first time a ceiling on a major export program that has boosted overseas sales of agricultural products. `` We have held the line, we have preserved and restored basic domestic programs, which is the most important thing,'' <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appropriations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> Chairman <PERSON> Jamie </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Whitten </PERSON>, D-Miss., said as the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> approved the bill 353-35 The measure, produced this week by a <ORGANIZATION> House-Senate </ORGANIZATION> conference committee, is awaiting action in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION>. The bill would furnish $ 46.6 billion in new budget authority, compared with last year's level of $ 56.2. billion. However, actual outlays in the fiscal year starting Saturday would be only $ 26.9 billion. The bill would provide $ 8.8 billion for the government-owned <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, which operates the nation's major crop subsidy programs. Other big-ticket items include: $ 13.6 billion for food stamps; $ 1.929 billion for the nutrition program for women, infants and children; $ 1.48 billion for humanitarian food exports to the Third World; and $ 1.864 billion for the Conservation Reserve Program. The Conservation Reserve Program pays farmers to take highly erodible land out of production for a decade. One reason for the large difference between budget authority and actual outlays is that the amount earmarked for the CCC is, in effect, a reimbursement to a revolving fund and not counted as an outlay. In other cases, outlays are not expected to go up to the full authority. In a major development, <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> negotiators decided to cap expenditures under the Export Enhancement Program, a major export subsidy, at $ 770 million in the upcoming fiscal year. The program, established under wide-ranging 1985 farm legislation, pays in-kind bonuses of surplus crops to spur exporters to send <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> wheat, feed grains and other commodities overseas. In establishing the program, lawmakers aimed at drastically reducing the huge surplus of crops that at the time was piled up in warehouses at taxpayer expense and give a shot in the arm to overseas sales of American farm goods. Since the launch of the program, it has provided more than $ 2 billion in these bonuses to the world's largest grain companies and other exporters. In its quest for savings in farm programs, the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> had sought to cap fiscal 1989 expenditures at $ 900 million. But the conferees opted for the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> level of $ 770 million. The panel also held to $ 200 million another export subsidy established under the 1985 law, the Targeted Export Assistance Program, under which the government pays for advertising and other promotional expenses of American products overseas. The authorized level for the program is $ 325 million but it has come under fire from lawmakers who question the use of taxpayer funds to boost sales of brand-name products. Commercial honey producers, who long have benefited from open-ended payment programs, suffered a setback under the bill. It would bar them from collecting more than $ 250,000 a year as a result of price-support loan forfeitures. Under normal farm-program procedures, farmers may obtain price-support loans from the government-owned <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Credit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, using their crops as collateral and then deliberately forfeit the collateral and keep the loan if that would yield them greater earnings. Lawmakers thought they had capped potential benefits under the program at $ 250,000 several years ago, but a handful of large-scale honey producers found a legal way to circumvent that ceiling. The bill aims to close that loophole. `` We hope this ends the funny business in the honey business,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Silvio </PERSON> <PERSON> Conte </PERSON>, R-Mass., who has been engaged in a long-running fiscal duel with the nation's commercial beekeepers

<HEAD>Gay Ex-Policeman Files $5 Million Discrimination Suit Against LAPD</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An ex-police sergeant who finished first in his academy class has filed a $ 5 million lawsuit against the <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, claiming he was discriminated against and endangered because he is homosexual. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> <PERSON> Grobeson </PERSON> said Wednesday that he was refused back-up help when he requested it during life-threatening situations. <PERSON> Grobeson </PERSON>, 29, also claims co-workers set up an arrested person to make false charges against him. In addition, he claims he met separately with Mayor <PERSON> Tom </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>, Police Commission President <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Talcott </PERSON>, a lieutenant and three captains, but none investigated his complaints. <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> also is named in the suit along with Police Chief <PERSON> Daryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Gates </PERSON> and numerous officers. Lt. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON>, a department spokesman, said the department does not comment on litigation. However, <PERSON> Nixon </PERSON> said the department has a policy of non-discrimination for reasons of sexual preference or religion or ethnicity and added, `` This is something we've stated very clearly before, and our record would support that.'' `` The <ORGANIZATION> Los </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Angeles </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Police </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> is one of the best departments in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, if not the world,'' <PERSON> Groebson </PERSON> said. `` But there are severe problems in management. Changes need to be made, not necessarily in the people who are there, but in their policies and practices.'' In the lawsuit, <PERSON> Grobeson </PERSON> alleges that on several occasions fellow officers refused to come to his assistance in potentially life-threatening situations. <PERSON> Grobeson </PERSON>'s suit also claims he received at his station items such as a package labeled `` AIDS survival kit'' and a picture of <PERSON> Rock </PERSON> <PERSON> Hudson </PERSON>, who died of the disease, inscribed, `` To <PERSON> Mitch </PERSON>, Love Rock Baby.'' The word `` Beware'' was scrawled on his private car while parked in a locked police lot, the suit alleged. The National Gay Rights Advocates, also a plaintiff in the suit, is seeking a court order barring the department from the alleged discriminatory practices. <PERSON> Grobeson </PERSON>, on the force for nearly seven years before resigning June 13, finished first in his class at the Police Academy and was honored for his work in resolving a stand-off last winter between property owners and the homeless who were camped on <LOCATION> Venice </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Democrats Who Voted Twice for Reagan Targeted by Both Camps</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> are ardently courting that segment of the electorate known as <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> <PERSON> Democrats </PERSON>, moderates who left their party twice to vote for <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. Estimated at roughly 10 percent of the electorate, these voters have different backgrounds and interests, experts say. In the North they tend to be ethnic, Catholic, and often blue collar, says <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> pollster <PERSON> Irwin </PERSON> `` Tubby'' <PERSON> Harrison </PERSON>. In the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>, they tend to be <ORGANIZATION> Protestant </ORGANIZATION>, not ethnic, and as likely to be in white-collar as blue-collar jobs. What they share are moderate or conservative leanings and views that <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> touched when he was campaigning for president in 1980 and, to an even greater extent, in 1984. They are by definition among the larger group of swing voters that will decide this election. `` It's fair to say <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> Democrats are an important target for both campaigns,'' said <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Mellman </PERSON>, a consultant to Democratic campaigns. `` Those are the kind of people among whom there is movement.'' For the Democratic nominee the struggle is to offer these voters a reason to return to their party and what were once traditional voting patterns. For <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, the Republican, the task is to present himself as representing a continuation of <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s policies. In both cases the candidates are using the economy to reach those voters: <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, citing sustained economic growth; <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, playing on unease about the future and the unevenness of the prosperity. `` In their hearts, they know that four more years of Reaganomics would be bad for the country, and that four more years of Reaganomics without <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> would be a disaster,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said in a direct appeal to those voters recently in <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> strategists acknowledge he has had some difficulty reaching these voters. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was booed earlier this month by union members in a <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ore. </LOCATION> shipyard. Bush Chief of Staff <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON> said the campaign wants to win back these <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> <PERSON> Democrats </PERSON> and is trying to schedule appearances aimed at them and emphasize issues with appeal to them. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has been sounding themes that worked so well for <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> _ strong defense, patriotism, anti-crime, and attempting to portray his Democratic rival as a liberal, a `` card-carrying member'' of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>. Virtually every piece of the <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign strategy is devoted to returning these voters to the Democratic fold. His reference to `` the middle class squeeze,'' his latest campaign theme, focuses on these voters as slighted by the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> prosperity and now needing two incomes to pay for what one income once did. His calls for new ways to make college education affordable and to extend health insurance to all Americans are similarly aimed at these voters. A week spent trying to strengthen his image on defense was aimed in part at these voters, particularly in the <LOCATION> South </LOCATION>. The so-called Reagan Democrats do n't make up the entire group of swing voters. There are also independents, voters with no party identification and whose votes are up for grabs each election. But polltakers distinguish those independents from those who retain party identification, even if it is only in their own minds. So far there is no clear signal which side will win them. An <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News-Washington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> poll taken Sept. 21-27 found the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> Democrats evenly divided, 48 percent preferring <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and 43 percent <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. A <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News-New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION> poll taken Sept. 8-11 found 9 percent of its sample of `` probable voters'' were the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> Democrats. Of this sliver of the electorate, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> had 44 percent of them, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had 34 percent, and 19 percent were undecided. If <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> succeeds in winning these voters, it may further shake their identification as Democrats. Experts say that for these voters to cast a third presidential vote for a <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> would represent a major step toward a more permanent political alignment. And even so, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> does not need to win all of these voters to be successful. `` The Constitution does n't require that you win with 60 percent of the vote, as <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> did -LRB- in 1984 -RRB-,'' <PERSON> Mellman </PERSON> said. `` You do n't have to get all <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> Democrats in order to win. To look at those numbers and say, ` Gee, he -LRB- <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> -RRB- is only getting 50 percent of them,' is a little bit foolish.''

<TEXT>
 A congressional candidate who kicked off his campaign by announcing he was gay withdrew from the race Thursday because of a heart ailment that hospitalized him twice in one week this month. `` I ca n't ignore this message from my heart,'' <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Gelpi </PERSON> said at a farewell breakfast meeting. `` It's with sincere regret that I am resigning from this campaign.'' The 47-year-old <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION> businessman said he has notified the <ORGANIZATION> Franklin </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elections </ORGANIZATION> that he is withdrawing from the 12th District race. <PERSON> Gelpi </PERSON>, who was running as an independent, won the endorsement of the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> after it was learned that <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brown </PERSON>, who ran unopposed in the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> primary, is a supporter of extremist <PERSON> Lyndon </PERSON> <PERSON> LaRouche </PERSON>. <PERSON> Brown </PERSON> will face Republican <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Rep. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kasich </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Westerville </LOCATION> in the Nov. 8 election. Shortly after a campaign appearance Sept. 14, <PERSON> Gelpi </PERSON> said he went to the hospital after feeling severe chest pains. He underwent angioplasty, a procedure that uses a balloon to open clogged arteries near the heart. One week later, he was again hospitalized and again underwent angioplasty. He said he feels healthy now, and will campaign on behalf of the Democratic presidential ticket and <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Sen. <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Metzenbuam </PERSON>, a Democrat who is seeking re-election against <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> challenger <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Voinovich </PERSON>, mayor of <LOCATION> Cleveland </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Gelpi </PERSON> said he took his doctors' advice to withdraw from the race, but he said his political future looks healthy. `` We have a whole bunch of posters, bumper stickers and badges left, none of which say 1988 on them,'' he said, smiling. `` We're going to put them in storage. He said he has few regrets about his campaign, including his acknowledgement of his sexual orientation. <PERSON> Gelpi </PERSON> said at the time he wanted to make the issue public to avoid making it a major issue in the campaign and to allow him to concentrate on other subjects, such as health care and housing. `` You know, people really did n't care. They wanted to know where I stood on the issues,'' he said. `` I'm pro-choice, I'm pro-teacher They could have found 14 other reasons not to vote for me other than I'm gay.''

 A second victim of a gunman's rampage at an elementary school died today, a few hours after students and teachers returned to class for the first time since the shooting spree that also left nine people wounded. The man accused in Monday's shootings at <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> said in an interview published today that he was copying a similar rampage by a woman in <LOCATION> Winnetka </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ill. </LOCATION>, and also thought of the taunting he suffered as a child. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, 19, said that as he pulled the trigger on his grandfather's .22 - caliber pistol, he was remembering being picked on by classmates at other schools for being overweight and dressing funny, <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> newspaper of <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> reported Eight-year-old <PERSON> Tequila </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, a third-grader hospitalized in critical condition since she was wounded, died shortly after noon today at Self Memorial Hospital, said <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Branyon </PERSON>, a hospital spokesman. Another 8-year-old girl, <PERSON> Shequila </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>, died at the school. `` All of us here at Self Memorial, as well as the community of <LOCATION> Greenwood </LOCATION>, the state of <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> and, I'm certain, the rest of the country join in expressing our deepest sympathy to the family of this little girl who put up such a valiant battle for life,'' <PERSON> Branyon </PERSON> said. `` Tequila never regained consciousness from the time of her arrival'' at the hospital, <PERSON> Branyon </PERSON> said. Children in this city 75 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> returned to classes at the 600-pupil school a bit nervously this morning. <PERSON> Leah </PERSON> <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON>, 8, her arm in a sling from a gunshot wound she suffered Monday, shook her head emphatically and said `` Nope,'' when asked whether she was scared to return to school. But other children and parents arriving at the school said they were jumpy. There was a police officer on every corner of the school grounds and at least three officers were stationed at the front of the building as parents and children arrived. `` We're a little nervous, but it's just been a shock primarily,'' said <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON>, as he walked his daughter <PERSON> Katy </PERSON> to school. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, who is charged with murder, was interviewed Wednesday by the newspaper by telephone at the <LOCATION> State </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, where he is undergoing psychological testing. Relatives have described him as a hyperactive recluse who has been in and out of a hospital psychiatric unit during the past eight months. Witnesses said <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> shot pupils who screamed during Monday's incident `` I thought some of the students in the school were after me,'' <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said in the interview. `` I was trying to make them be quiet. `` I feel real bad about what happened.'' On May 20, <PERSON> Laurie </PERSON> <PERSON> Dann </PERSON> killed an 8-year-old boy and wounded six people in and around a school in the affluent <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> suburb of <LOCATION> Winnetka </LOCATION> before killing herself. `` I could understand where she was coming from,'' <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said. `` I think I may have copied her in a way.'' He said he was thinking about an article about <PERSON> Dann </PERSON> that he had torn from a June issue of People magazine. `` I read it every day,'' he said. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> also said he was up all night before the shootings reading a book about <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Gacy </PERSON>, who was convicted in 1980 of killing 33 men and boys, most of whom were buried under his suburban <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> house. <PERSON> Gacy </PERSON> is on death row in an <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> prison. Asked if the book was a factor in the shootings, <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said, `` It's possible.'' He said he had contemplated the shootings a couple of times, but there wss nothing in particular that triggered the act. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said he remembered little of the shootings. `` It was like a fog or a dream,'' he said, recalling pupils fleeing through windows and blood on a hallway floor where a teacher was shot. `` I remember being at the back of the school with my hands up and the police arresting me,'' he said. `` I do n't remember feeling anything.'' Two teachers who were wounded remained hospitalized today, and one of six students treated and released was admitted today in fair condition, complaining of discomfort from her wounds. Physical education teacher <PERSON> Kat </PERSON> <PERSON> Finkbeiner </PERSON>, who was shot in the hand and mouth while trying to subdue the attacker, and teacher <PERSON> Eleanor </PERSON> <PERSON> Hodge </PERSON> were in good condition, <PERSON> Branyon </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Principal </ORGANIZATION> <PERSON> Eleanor </PERSON> <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> and other school officials talked with about 500 students and parents Wednesday night to help ease the return to school, which has kindergarten through fourth grade. Ms. <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> praised school staff members for trying to protect the children. `` But it was n't enough,'' she said. `` Each child in <LOCATION> Oakland </LOCATION> is loved, and loved dearly. We do everything in our power to make school a healthyplace and a happy place. But at this time, we feel helpless.''

<TEXT>
 Mayor <PERSON> Kurt </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schmoke </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION> advocated the legalization of illicit drugs to a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> committee Thursday but received no support from lawmakers. Fellow mayors who appeared as witnesses with him declined to endorse his recommendation for legalization but said the idea should be researched, discussed and debated. <PERSON> Schmoke </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> Select </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> on </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Narcotics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Abuse </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> that for the past 75 years the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has considered illicit drugs a law enforcement problem, a policy that has not reduced addiction or crime. `` It has been demonstrated that the criminal law enforcement system's ability to do anything about the medical problem of addiction is very limited,'' he said. And he said law enforcement has not only failed to solve the problem of drug-related crime but has worsened it. `` Let us begin a phased-in process of fighting drug addiction as a public health problem, not as a crime problem,'' said <PERSON> Schmoke </PERSON>. First, he said, would be the elimination of criminal penalties for marijuana possession and the reallocation of money and manpower from interdiction efforts to drug abuse programs. <PERSON> Schmoke </PERSON> said his second recommendation would permit health professionals to distribute methadone, heroin and cocaine to addicts as part of supervised maintenance or treatment programs. Thirdly, he would establish an independent commission to study substances of abuse, including tobacco and alcohol, and make recommendations on how they should be regulated based upon their potential for harm. `` If we are going to have a new war on drugs, I would rather have it led by the surgeon general and not the attorney general,'' said <PERSON> Schmoke </PERSON>, a former prosecutor. The heavily attended hearing was prompted by a speech and subsequent television apprearances <PERSON> Schmoke </PERSON> made last spring in arguing for legalization and decriminalization of illicit drugs. Mayors <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> of <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Master </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Charles </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Town </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> W. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Callahan </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Annapolis </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Md. </LOCATION>, opposed legalization. Mayor <PERSON> Marion </PERSON> <PERSON> Barry </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, said he did n't have an opinion on legalization but thought it should be discussed and debated. Committee Chairman <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rangel </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, and members <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilman </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.Y. </LOCATION>, and <PERSON> Fortney </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Stark </PERSON>, D-Calif., also opposed legalization Rep. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Scheuer </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, said the issue should be researched. <PERSON> Koch </PERSON> said the suggestion that drugs should be legalized is shocking. `` In part because of the frustration some have had with the difficult task of addressing the drug problem, the idea of legalization has been elevated, undeservedly, to a place within the realm of debatable, if not potential, policy alternatives,'' he said. `` When people say that we should legalize drugs because law enforcement efforts have failed, they ignore the fact that a truly effective war has yet to be launched against drugs,'' said <PERSON> Koch </PERSON>. `` What we really need to do is more, not less.'' <PERSON> Rangel </PERSON>, who has long opposed legalization, said he was concerned about the impact of drugs on the future of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` But unlike some of those have grown weary of this crisis, I am in no way ready to give up and say that we have fought the fight and have lost the war on drugs,' he said. `` I am not ready to give up when we have yet to begin the fight. We have not even fired the first shot.''

 A 26-year-old man has been charged with robbing two taverns and shooting to death the man who tried to stop him both times, police said today. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Riegler </PERSON>, a 67-year-old widower known as Old <PERSON> Joe </PERSON>, was slain Tuesday night after intervening in the robberies just hours apart at his two favorite taverns. Investigators first believed the robberies were unrelated, but now have charged <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Brien </PERSON> <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> with both, as well as pistol-whipping <PERSON> Riegler </PERSON> at the first tavern and shooting him to death at the second, police spokesman <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Riegler </PERSON> was shot to death outside The Table tavern in northeast <LOCATION> Portland </LOCATION> by a man who walked into the bar with a knife, cut the cord on the cash register and walked out with the machine. `` It's the ultimate hard-luck story,'' police Detective <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Baumgarte </PERSON> said. `` He's at the first tavern when some guy comes in and robs the place. He tries to stop him and gets pistol-whipped. `` He goes to the hospital, is treated and released. He ends up at a second tavern and that place is robbed,'' <PERSON> Baumgarte </PERSON> said. `` Against the warnings of the other patrons, he gets involved. He follows the robber outside and is shot in the head.'' <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> said investigators believe it was a coincidence that both <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> and <PERSON> Riegler </PERSON> headed for the same tavern after the first robbery. The man who robbed The Table wore a ski mask, while the robber of The Cracker Box tavern did not, however. <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> also was charged with trying to kill a police officer by ramming his car when officers tried to arrest him, <PERSON> Simpson </PERSON> said. Detectives began watching <PERSON> Kelly </PERSON> after receiving information that implicated him in both robberies and arrested him Wednesday night, he said. He was held without bail pending arraignment this afternoon. Friends said <PERSON> Riegler </PERSON>, a regular at both taverns, took the robberies personally. `` He felt someone was breaking into his home,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>, owner of The Cracker Box. `` He liked coming in here. He was content to have a beer or two and just visit with friends.'' In the wake of the killing, <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON> said he was considering closing his tavern. `` My feelings are right now that I'm going to lock this place up and close the sucker down for good. But when his funeral is over,'' he said, `` I'm going to open it up one more time. `` I'm going to invite all his friends in, and we'll drink a toast to him.''

 <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ana </LOCATION> winds fanned an arson fire and another blaze, burning nearly 6,000 acres of brush and three structures, forcing residents to flee and threatening homes and other buildings. Up to 150 homes were ordered evacuated just before 5 a.m. today and classes at three schools were canceled as flames from one of the intense blazes continued to burn out of control and winds surged up to 60 mph, officials said. By late morning, it appeared the danger had passed as the fire skirted around the development. `` It looks like they made it,'' said <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Steward </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forestry </ORGANIZATION>. The larger fire, dubbed the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> blaze, had blackened more than 5,200 acres and was just 20 percent contained early today, after having been about halfway contained the previous day, she said. Emergency workers canvassed several blocks of Rancho Cucamonga before dawn urging residents to move to safety at a shelter set up in a community center, said <PERSON> Paula </PERSON> <PERSON> Pachon </PERSON>, spokeswoman for the town's emergency services office. The <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> fire erupted Wednesday morning at the mouth of <LOCATION> Duncan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canyon </LOCATION>, 50 miles east of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. Forestry Cmdr. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Timmer </PERSON> said the fire was set, but provided no details. Two miles away, wind fanned to life the embers of a controlled burn near <PERSON> Glen </PERSON> <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> that was thought to have been doused Tuesday, authorities said. More than 1,000 firefighters battled the two fires. The Verdemont Boys Ranch, a juvenile detention center, some homes and a high school in the northern <LOCATION> Rialto </LOCATION> area were evacuated as a precaution because of the <PERSON> Glen </PERSON> <PERSON> Helen </PERSON> blaze, which covered about 675 acres and had been surrounded, or contained, late Wednesday before showing signs of flaring up, Ms. <PERSON> Steward </PERSON> said. The <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> fire destroyed two outbuildings and a ranch house as it weaved among about 60 structures, half of them ranch homes. Property losses were estimated at more than $ 374,000, Ms. <PERSON> Steward </PERSON> said. One civilian was treated for smoke inhalation, authorities said. `` The wind and the low humidity are the primary causes for the fire to be spreading so quickly,'' <PERSON> Timmer </PERSON> said. The other blaze erupted in an area where authorities intentionally burned overgrown brush the day before, said forestry spokeswoman LoVae Pray-Martines. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Curtis </PERSON>, 73, said a firebreak he cut last spring was all that saved his house from flames that leapt about as he rushed to put out hotspots. A quarter-mile away, a chimney and smoldering posts were all that remained of another ranch house. A gutted pickup truck stood in the driveway. Nearby was a portable swimming pool filled with ashes 3 feet deep. Flames licked within a few feet of <PERSON> Dave </PERSON> <PERSON> Landmesser </PERSON>'s chicken ranch, but a sprinkler system for keeping the birds cool stopped the flames. `` It works good for cooling chickens and it worked good for putting out a fire,'' he said after finding only five of his 175,000 birds killed by smoke inhalation. <PERSON> Marcia </PERSON> <PERSON> Nave </PERSON>, who lives in the hillsabove <PERSON> Fontana </PERSON>, said she loaded her van with jewelry, photographs and heirloom guns but waited until the last minute to leave. `` We had to drive through flames. I was afraid of catching the van on fire,'' Ms. <PERSON> Nave </PERSON> said as tears formed in her eyes. `` I do n't know what has happened to my house. Interstate 15, the main link between <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Las </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Vegas </LOCATION>, was closed temporarily when flames leaped across it Wednesday. The <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Weather </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> predicted northeast winds through today because of the <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ana </LOCATION>, a condition in which air flows from high pressure over the <LOCATION> Great </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Basin </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> toward low pressure off the <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> coast. Elsewhere in the West, more than 1,800 firefighters at <ORGANIZATION> Yellowstone </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Park </ORGANIZATION> concentrated their efforts on hot spots. Though warmer weather was forecast, recent snow and rain should keep the flames down, officials said. To prevent erosion, rehabilitation crews began filling in the fire lines dug this summer as flames scorched half of the 2.2-million-acre park.

 A Brazilian jetliner with more than 98 people aboard was hijacked today by a man who killed the co-pilot and at least one passenger, officials said. <PERSON> Mona </PERSON> <PERSON> Cury </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the <ORGANIZATION> VASP </ORGANIZATION>, or <ORGANIZATION> Viacao </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aerea </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sao </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Paulo </ORGANIZATION> airline, said Flight 375 was on its daily run from the <LOCATION> Amazon </LOCATION> jungle city of <LOCATION> Porto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Velho </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Janeiro </LOCATION> on the southeast <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> coast when it was hijacked.

Col. <PERSON> Eden </PERSON> <PERSON> Asvolinsque </PERSON>, an air force spokesman, said in <LOCATION> Brasilia </LOCATION> that the hijacker `` invaded the cockpit and forced the crew to surrender.'' He said the plane was ordered flown to <LOCATION> Brasilia </LOCATION>, 750 miles northwest of <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION>. However, bad weather forced the pilot to land in <LOCATION> Goiania </LOCATION>, a city 150 miles from <LOCATION> Brasilia </LOCATION>, he said. <PERSON> Avolinsque </PERSON> said an <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> jet intercepted the hijacked plane and accompanied it to <LOCATION> Goiania </LOCATION>.

During the hijacking, the co-pilot and a passenger were killed, possibly by gunfire, the airport authority at <LOCATION> Rio </LOCATION>'s Galeao International Airport said. `` The co-pilot is dead, and so is one passenger.

<HEAD>Du Pont to Begin Production of Substitute for Ozone-Destroying
Chemical</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By GUY DARST</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Du </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pont </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> plans to begin commercial production in 1990 of a substitute for one of the most important ozone-destroying chemicals, the one used in auto air conditioners, the company announced Thursday. The company said it will spend more than $ 25 million to install a unit at its <LOCATION> Corpus </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Christi </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, plant to make HFC-134a, a short-lived fluorocarbon containing no chlorine that the company intends to sell for the refrigeration uses of CFC-12, one of the chlorofluorocarbon or CFC compounds. The company said millions of tons of the chemical would be produced commercially each year compared with tens of thousands of tons available for research from three small pilot plants. Since it contains no chlorine, the new compound has no effect on the ozone layer when it breaks up in the atmosphere. <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Glas </PERSON>, director of <ORGANIZATION> Du </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pont </ORGANIZATION>'s Freon products division, said the company had told its foam-blowing customers for CFC-12 that it would stop offering the compound for that use when a subsititute becomes available next year, and it will withdraw CFC-12 from refrigeration markets as the new compound becomes available. Also, he said, the company would support recycling initiatives at auto repair shops to recover CFC-12 and process it for re-use in cars that need it. <PERSON> Liz </PERSON> <PERSON> Cook </PERSON>, ozone specialist for the environmental group Friends of the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION>, praised <ORGANIZATION> Du </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pont </ORGANIZATION>'s announcement, saying, `` <PERSON> Du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> is clearly trying for the gold medal in the substitute race.'' There have been estimates that as much as 75 percent of CFC-12 sold for auto air conditioners is wasted in the replacement markets, simply thrown away by mechanics and motorists as leftovers. <PERSON> Du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> is `` taking a significant risk, but a risk our board of directors insists we take'' in deciding on production before the completion of toxicity testing, <PERSON> Glas </PERSON> said. Though the industry testing consortium will not begin until next year the two-year laboratory animal studies necessary to establish or rule out a chemical as a cause of cancer, <PERSON> Glas </PERSON> said, `` We have very high confidence the acute toxicity is low,'' and testers have finished `` initial screens on mutagenic properties and that looks pretty good.'' One reason the <ORGANIZATION> CFC </ORGANIZATION> compounds are so widely used is they are normally non-reactive, non-flammable and non-toxic. It takes the powerful ultraviolet rays of the sun, normally shielded by ozone high in the stratosphere, to break up <ORGANIZATION> CFC </ORGANIZATION> molecules, which liberates their chlorine to attack the ozone that keeps those cancer-causing rays from reaching the surface of the earth. Major producing nations agreed last year to cut <ORGANIZATION> CFC </ORGANIZATION> production by 50 percent in 1998, but the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> said Monday its latest analyses show the compounds should be dropped around the world. <ORGANIZATION> DuPont </ORGANIZATION>, the world's largest producer, said in March it would end production by the end of the century. <PERSON> Du </PERSON> <PERSON> Pont </PERSON> and other companies have announced several <ORGANIZATION> CFC </ORGANIZATION> substitutes, but Thursday's announcement was the first for the important refrigeration market for CFC-12. Some 90 million vehicles use it in air conditioners; 75 percent of the nation's food is chilled or frozen with it and it is in every home refrigerator. <ORGANIZATION> DuPont </ORGANIZATION> estimates the market at 40 percent of some 330,000 tons of CFCs used in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> each year.

 <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping troops from the <LOCATION> Iran-Iraq </LOCATION> border to this war-divided island celebrated their Nobel Peace Prize on Thursday with champagne and a renewed spirit that their missions are important. `` We are here to keep the peace, but winning the Nobel prize makes you feel good,'' said Canadian Trooper <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Mayfield </PERSON>, 22. He and <PERSON> Grant </PERSON> <PERSON> Townsend </PERSON>, 22, also of <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, guarded a crossing point linking the Greek and Turkish Cypriot sectors of <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>. The 2,000-strong peace force in <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> has been maintaining the peace since clashes between the Greek and Turkish Cypriot communities first broke out in 1964. `` The Nobel is a feather in the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>' cap. It gives us an incentive to continue,'' <PERSON> Mayfield </PERSON> said. Peacekeepers in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION> popped open bottles of champagne as the word was passed by radio from outpost to outpost. Five of the seven <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping forces worldwide are stationed in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> _ <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>, southern <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s northern and southern borders, <LOCATION> Syria </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Golan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heights </LOCATION> and the Iran-Iraq border The others are along the India-Pakistan border and in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. Spokesmen said the prize was a tribute to the thousands who serve in difficult conditions. Nearly 10,000 peacekeepers wear the blue beret that has come to symbolize the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION>'s role in monitoring truces and trying to prevent bloodshhed. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Nobel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> recognizes that the quest for peace is a universal undertaking involving all the nations and peoples of the world,'' said Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON>. Pvt. <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Mahony </PERSON>, 26, of <PERSON> Cork </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>, said he hoped the award would make <ORGANIZATION> UNIFIL </ORGANIZATION>'s job easier in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. `` I feel proud. I suppose we'll get more respect now,'' <PERSON> Mahony </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. `` It is a very happy occasion that our work is appreciated. It is always good news when people say you are doing good work,'' said Major J.H. <PERSON> Buhl </PERSON> of the 340-member Danish contingent on <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>. A duty officer from <LOCATION> Bangladesh </LOCATION> at the headquarters of the nearly 2-month-old <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Iran-Iraq </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Military </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Observer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> heard the news from a reporter. `` It is exciting,'' said the officer, who refused to give his name. He said the men at the front `` will know that their job is worth doing.'' <PERSON> Timor </PERSON> <PERSON> Goksel </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> UNIFIL </ORGANIZATION> spokesman in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, said, `` The international community has finally given appropriate recognition to all the sacrifices our people have made.'' Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Vadset </PERSON>, chief of staff of the U.N. Truce Supervision Organization in <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, said the award recognized the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeepers' success in preventing conflicts from escalating. `` We have lived through all the wars you can think of and one might say that we have been unsuccessful in preventing them,'' said <PERSON> Vadset </PERSON>, a Norwegian. `` But we have been successful in being available to minimize disaster when it first broke out.'' `` I think the committee chose exactly the right time'' to give the prize to the peacekeepers, said <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Urquhart </PERSON>, the British <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> undersecretary who set up the peace forces until he retired in 1985. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping officials in <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION>, which contributes more troops than any other country, said they hoped the Nobel Peace Prize would induce members to pay their bills for the financially ailing forces. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> is in arrears in payments to countries which provide soldiers for the peacekeeping forces. It owes <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION> $ 22.5 million.

 Here is the announcement by the <ORGANIZATION> Nobel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday that the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping troops won the 1988 Nobel Peace Prize. This is the committee's official English-language version. The Norwegian Nobel Committee has decided that the 1988 Nobel Peace Prize is to be awarded to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping forces. The peacekeeping forces of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> have under extremely difficult conditions contributed to reducing tensions where an armistice has been negotiatied but a peace treaty has yet to be established. In situations of this kind the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> forces represent the manifest will of the community of nations to achieve peace through negotiations, and the forces have by their presence made a decisive contribution towards the initiation of actual peace negotiations. It is the considered opinion of the committee that the peacekeeping forces through their efforts have made important contributions towards the realization of one of the fundamental tenets of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. Thus the world organization has come to play a more central part in world affairs and has been invested with increasing trust. The peacekeeping forces are recruited from among the young people of many nations, who, in keeping with their ideals, voluntarily take on a demanding and hazardous service in the cause of peace. In the opinion of the committee their efforts contribute in a particularly appropriate way towards the realization of the goals of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>.

 Thirty-two months of anxiety and frustration burst into exuberance _ and relief _ as the space shuttle Discovery roared away Thursday and broke through a cloud of doubt over space workers across the country. `` This is a very, very special mission to us all,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kaltenbach </PERSON>, an 18-year <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> employee who watched at <ORGANIZATION> Johnson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION> as a senior advance system specialist for <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> `` There was probably more apprehension and excitement in this one. This one had to fly. `` Relief ... absolute relief. It feels so good,'' <PERSON> Kaltenbach </PERSON> exulted. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Hotz </PERSON>, who covered the early days of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> space program for <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Week </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Technology </ORGANIZATION> magazine and later served on the presidential commission that investigated the Challenger disaster, said: `` This is about as emotional a flight as I ever witnessed. `` I did n't cheer, I yelled. I'm still trying to get everything under control,'' <PERSON> Hotz </PERSON> said. <PERSON> J.R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Marshall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, broke out a foot-long <ORGANIZATION> Royal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jamaica </ORGANIZATION> cigar to celebrate. Inside the Kennedy Space Center control room, he said, there was a progression of smiles, thumbs-up signs, cheers and finally, `` a roar,'' as the Discovery passed each of its initial post-launch tests. Outside the neighboring Vehicle Assembly Building here, hundreds of workers left their stations inside to whoop and cheer along with the launch that allowed them to again look ahead to a more-stable space program than the revisions, layoffs, firings and uncertainty that followed the Jan. 28, 1986, Challenger explosion. `` Unique, super, great! All those good words,'' <PERSON> Forrest </PERSON> <PERSON> McCartney </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Kennedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> director, said as he slapped backs and grabbed hands to shake. `` It's an indescribable boost to morale,'' <PERSON> McCartney </PERSON> said. `` The sole job of these people is to do what they did today. It's been a very long time for them. This was their living, their masterpiece, today.'' `` Everybody's going out to buy a house now,'' said a security guard as the workers shook hands and began laughing on their way back to work. At the <ORGANIZATION> Marshall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flight </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Huntsville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ala. </LOCATION>, space workers wearing the green ribbons and clothes symbolizing `` Go'' for Discovery prayed, clapped, then cheered. As at other space centers, many sported the `` Back to the Future'' buttons with the unofficial theme for the Discovery mission. `` My feeling came at 8 -LCB- minutes when the engines went off,'' said <PERSON> Jerry </PERSON> <PERSON> Cox </PERSON>, a senior engineer who worked on the shuttle's main engine. `` I've been involved with that for 2 -LCB- years, and it was a tremendous relief when that point came.'' In <LOCATION> Brigham </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION>, a tearful Mayor <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Knudson </PERSON> called the launch `` one of the greatest moments of my life.'' <LOCATION> Utah </LOCATION> is home to some 8,000 employees of <ORGANIZATION> Morton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION>, designers of the 126-foot solid rocket boosters. A faulty joint seal on a Challenger booster was blamed for the explosion. Unlike for the first manned spaceflights and the Apollo moonflights he observed as a reporter, <PERSON> Hotz </PERSON> was here watching to see how <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> had reacted to the sharp criticism of the <ORGANIZATION> Rogers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> he belonged to. The late-morning delay while some unusual wind conditions were studied were part of the new caution of a more-humble <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>, he said. `` I'm very pleased with <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>. They really took the lesson of Challenger to heart,'' <PERSON> Hotz </PERSON> said. Some former <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> employees said the launch was long overdue. `` I think it was real important to get back in space again,'' said <PERSON> Sam </PERSON> <PERSON> Beddingfield </PERSON>, a retired <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> manager who now has a private space consulting firm. `` I'm disappointed that it took so long. Now they can get going again.'' At the Kennedy Space Center, <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuznetz </PERSON> remained cynical about the space program's future because of political vagaries. `` The problem is we do n't have a commitment to space,'' said <PERSON> Kuznetz </PERSON>, involved in thermal tile development, spacesuit testing and other aspects of the shuttle mission before he left <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> in 1984. Now a teacher for the Boston-based <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, which seeks international cooperation in space research and study, <PERSON> Kuznetz </PERSON> said the class he taught at <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> California-Berkeley </ORGANIZATION> built a fullscale replica of the Challenger in the two years after the tragedy. `` I was drawn back here like a magnet,'' he said. `` After the panic, the witchhunt, the finger-pointing, I think this will be very good,'' <PERSON> Kuznetz </PERSON> said, adding quietly: `` This kind of closes a loop.''

<HEAD>House Approves $14.3 Billion Foreign Aid Bill</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> adopted and sent to the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Thursday a compromise $ 14.3 billion foreign aid bill that shifts emphasis to grants, rather than loans, for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military assistance to friendly countries. The vote was 327-92. House and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> negotiators, in an all-night session last week, set up a program for overseas arms sales that will provide $ 3.8 billion in outright grants and $ 410 million in loans made on favorable terms during the fiscal year that begins Saturday. The agreement also retained the current Military Assistance Program, with grants in fiscal 1989 totaling $ 467 million. As ususal, the largest recipients of military and economic aid are <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>, which receive hefty support because of their 1979 peace treaty. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> would get $ 1.2 billion in economic and $ 1.8 billion in military assistance, while <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> would get $ 815 million in economic aid and $ 1.2 billion in military aid. All of the military aid for both would be in the form of grants. The foreign aid bill has been remarkably without controversy this year, in part because of last year's agreement between the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration and <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> that smoothed the way for the year's money bills. If given final <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> approval and sent to President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, it would be the first time in seven years that a separate foreign aid bill has been approved. Usually, the measure has been rolled into catch-all spending bills in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' rush to adjourn. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has indicated its support for this year's compromise measure. In one provision that briefly threatened to undo the compromise, the bill would provide $ 50 million as the first of six yearly installments toward recapitalizing the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, which makes loans to developing countries. House members had objected to the provision on Wednesday, delaying the measure by a day. Opponents argue that increasing loans to third-world countries without first demanding economic reforms is counterproductive, and some conservatives oppose the bank because they say it makes loans to communist countries. But the money ultimately was left in the bill as part of the overall compromise on a vote of 303-90. Among other provisions in the bill: _ $ 2 million for internal opposition parties in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>, to be provided through the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Endowment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Democracy </ORGANIZATION>. The money can not go to any group that supports the Contra rebels or other armed opponents of the leftist Sandinistat regime. The amount is an increase from this year's $ 800,000, and is to go for union organizing, buying supplies for opposition media and political training. _ $ 101 million for international narcotics control programs run by the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, a $ 2 million increase from the current fiscal year. The increase is to fund drug eradication and interdiction efforts, particularly aerial herbicide spraying of coca plants. _ $ 35 million for <LOCATION> Jamaica </LOCATION>, for use in recovery from damage caused by Hurricane <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> earlier this month. Other major aid allocations include the <LOCATION> Philippines </LOCATION>, which would get $ 125 million in military aid, $ 124 million in economic aid and $ 40 million for development; an African development fund, which would get $ 500 million; $ 500 million in military aid and $ 60 million in economic aid for <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>; and $ 350 million in military aid for <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION> would receive $ 185 million in economic support, <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> $ 80 million, <LOCATION> Costa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rica </LOCATION> $ 90 million, and <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> $ 85 million. <LOCATION> Guatemala </LOCATION> also would get $ 9 million in `` non-lethal'' military support to help its civilian government eliminate human rights abuses and assert control over the military. The bill also would continue bans on aid to <LOCATION> Panama </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>. The bill includes $ 215 million in economic and $ 230 million in military aid for <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>; $ 43 million to aid Afghan refugees; $ 2 million for the Polish trade union Solidarity; at least $ 10 million for <LOCATION> Ireland </LOCATION>; $ 30 million in military aid and $ 11 million in economic aid for <LOCATION> Tunisia </LOCATION>; and $ 50 million in economic aid for <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION>.

 The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> released the first photos of its secret space shuttle Thursday in a move that appeared timed to steal some of the thunder from the launch of Discovery. Photos of the Soviet craft, which looks just like the American shuttle, moved on the wires of the official <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency at about the time the Discovery was scheduled to blast off from <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canaveral </LOCATION>. Along with the photos of the Soviet craft, the agency transmitted a brief dispatch on the American launch. The Soviet shuttle previously was not shown to the Soviet or foreign public, although some Western reconnaissance photographs of the craft or mockup versions have been taken. The Tass photos showed the Soviet spacecraft against a twilight sky, with its black-tipped white wings and fuselage. The letters `` CCCP'' _ Russian for <LOCATION> U.S.S.R. </LOCATION> _ were written in red on one wing. State-run Soviet television did not broadcast the Discovery launch live, but showed only a film clip of the American craft sitting on the launch pad in darkness. An announcer read a report on the blastoff during a regularly scheduled newscast a few minutes later. The evening television news program Vremya, which is watched by millions of Soviets, showed still pictures of the Soviet shuttle as its third item and said that ground tests of its equipment were continuing. It showed film of the Discovery launch about 20 minutes later. Radio <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s international newscast also juxtaposed reports about the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> takeoff with updates on the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> space station Mir _ meaning both <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> and Peace _ with three cosmonauts aboard. Despite repeated comments by Soviet officials that their shuttle has a distinct design and capabilities, the <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> photographs indicated it was quite similar to the American version. The Soviet shuttle, under development since at least 1982, has delta-shaped wings like its American counterpart, and is mated to its booster rocket, the <ORGANIZATION> Energia </ORGANIZATION>, in a similar way as the American craft. Mir was pictured in front of the huge <ORGANIZATION> Energia </ORGANIZATION> booster, which can carry payloads of up to 100 tons _ much more than the American shuttle. In the photos, the booster and shuttle stood upright on tarmac, apparently at the Baikonur Cosmodrome in <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>, but it was not clear if it was stationed at a launchpad. Soviet officials have said their shuttle will be launched by the end of 1988, but have not given an exact date. They have acknowledged technical problems are causing delays. They also point to the Jan. 28, 1986, explosion of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> shuttle Challenger, which caused a 2 -LCB- - year suspension in the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> manned space program, as an example of the hazards they are trying to prevent The Soviet shuttle's first flight is to be unmanned. The Energia booster has been tested once, on May 15, 1987, when it successfully carried aloft a dummy spacecraft. Soviet program also has had difficulties this month. Soviet officials said they have lost radio contact with one of two Mars probes launched in July. In addition, the re-entry to Earth of a Soviet and an Afghan cosmonaut aboard a space capsule that docked with Mir nearly failed because of equipment problems and human error. The Soviets' main goal has been to maintain a continuous manned presence in space. Cosmonaut crews have been aboard the orbiting space station Mir without a break since February 1987. <PERSON> Yuri </PERSON> <PERSON> Romanenko </PERSON> set a space endurance record last year by staying in space 326 days, and officials have said they expect the two cosmonauts currently aboard the craft to break <PERSON> Romanenko </PERSON>'s record.

<TEXT>
 As <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> and <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> turn their attention to debate briefing books, experts predict their showdown next week could be the most important ever between two men vying for the vice presidency. The pressure is on both candidates next Wednesday night in <LOCATION> Omaha </LOCATION>, largely because of the controversy surrounding <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Guard </ORGANIZATION> stint at the height of the Vietnam War and his admission to law school `` This debate could be decisive in the election. And never before could you say that about a vice presidential debate,'' said <PERSON> Joel </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Swerdlow </PERSON>, who edited a volume on presidential debates and has written extensively on the subject. `` This is the first time in modern history that a vice presidential candidate may fail to pass the threshold of acceptability,'' said <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> Jamieson </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION>, an expert on politics and the media. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> spent Thursday in briefings here and looked ahead to a weekend of tutelage from <PERSON> Roger </PERSON> <PERSON> Ailes </PERSON>, the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign's media guru. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> snatched time to study during a light campaign schedule before returning here late Friday for two days with top <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> advisers. The nation has seen only two vice presidential debates: Republican <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> vs. Democrat <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON> in 1976 and Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> vs. Democrat <PERSON> Geraldine </PERSON> <PERSON> Ferraro </PERSON> in 1984. Although <PERSON> Mondale </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> were considered victors in those contests, `` <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> passed the threshold of acceptability and for most people so did <PERSON> Ferraro </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Jamieson </PERSON>. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, however, is a question mark to a large number of voters, she said. `` The stakes are very high for <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>,'' she said. Both <PERSON> Jamieson </PERSON> and <PERSON> Swerdlow </PERSON> said <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s performance is particularly important because his choice has been linked so closely to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s judgment. `` He could cost <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> a close election,'' <PERSON> Jamieson </PERSON> said. Much has been said and written about the low expectations for <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, and how that might be an advantage for him in the debate. `` If he can appear the equal of <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, he'll score an overwhelming victory,'' said <PERSON> Jamieson </PERSON>. But low expectations can also hurt. `` People will be disposed to hear errors as errors,'' unlike minor flubs forgiven in last Sunday's debate between <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, <PERSON> Jamieson </PERSON> said. Debates tend to reinforce views of a candidate that people already have, and in <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s case `` a stumbling performance will not be forgiven,'' she said. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, on the other hand, has the burden of showing himself of presidential timber while not talking down to <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, and at the same time trying to score hits against <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` You ca n't make fun of someone'' and the standard <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> one-liners from the campaign trail wo n't work in a debate, said <PERSON> Swerdlow </PERSON>. With an eye toward the debate, the <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> campaign tried this week to display confidence in <LOCATION> Quayle </LOCATION>, including a joint appearance by the two Republicans. `` He's been accused of lacking in every skill, social and otherwise. But he's a good campaigner and we expect him to do well in the debate,'' said <PERSON> Sheila </PERSON> <PERSON> Tate </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s spokeswoman. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> `` has to defend <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s position because most of them are his own. I think he will squirm,'' she said, a reference to <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s many differences with <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> on the issues. <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Fuller </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s chief of staff, said <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> will pursue the Republican argument that <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> is more attuned to <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> attitudes than those of <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>. `` Quayle is going to go after the top of the ticket. The fact that <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> is more closely aligned with our ticket does n't hurt,'' he said The <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> senator this week unleashed his harshest attacks yet on his junior colleague from <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION>. `` I'll tell you, if they were elected, I'd pray for the good health of <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> every night,'' <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> said Wednesday. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s chief of staff, <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Neill </PERSON>, said <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> will try to tie <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> closely to <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> to show `` that our team is better than their team.'' Privately, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s aides say they're worried <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, 67, will look and sound old when put next to <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, who is 26 years younger. Both sides have viewed tapes of an April 22 broadcast of public television's MacNeil @ Lehrer NewsHour, on which <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> and <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> debated the issue of giving workers 60 days' notice before a plant could be closed. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> eventually lost the battle on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> floor, but on television he presented his case attractively while <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> looked gray. While <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> plans to work this weekend with <PERSON> Ailes </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> has been working with <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheehan </PERSON>, a consultant who specializes in making candidates look good on television. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> returns to <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> Friday for two days of meetings and briefings. He travels Sunday back to <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> for final preparations, including mock debates with Democratic Rep. <PERSON> Dennis </PERSON> <PERSON> Eckart </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION> playing <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. Top Republicans including <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Ann </PERSON> <PERSON> McLaughlin </PERSON> and former Secretary of State <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Kissinger </PERSON> have already briefed <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, who will remain in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> until debate day except for a Friday fund-raiser in <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>. In mock debates, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> is using Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Packwood </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, a long-time colleague of <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>'s on the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>.

 Flags waved, cameras clicked and tears flowed as a smaller-than-expected crowd of about 250,000 people along <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Coast </ORGANIZATION> cheered the shuttle Discovery liftoff late Thursday morning. `` Oh my gosh, it was great,'' said 11-year-old <PERSON> Tommy </PERSON> <PERSON> Mathis </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Detroit </LOCATION>. `` It was neat watching ... it just looked like a ball of fire at first going up. And it went into a cloud halfway up. `` As soon as it went out, it was beautiful,'' he said. <PERSON> Patricia </PERSON> <PERSON> Mathis </PERSON>, 33, his mother, said tears just streamed down her face. `` I thought the most intense part was when they realized they were past that Challenger stage.'' Challenger blew up 73 seconds after launch on Jan. 28, 1986, killing its seven astronauts. The crowds turned out to be far smaller than the 1 million authorities had been advised to prepare for. <PERSON> Mitch </PERSON> <PERSON> Varnes </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Kennedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION>, said reports of the large crowds may have kept some away. But those who risked traffic jams and launch delays seemed more than satisfied they came. `` There's an awful lot of people that this means a whole bunch to that it did n't mean a thing two years ago,'' said <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Zsolczai </PERSON>, a butcher from <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> who has seen 16 shuttle launches. He arrived Wednesday night but said he had a hard time settling to sleep in his van, which was decorated with signs wishing <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> and the Discovery crew good luck. `` Every 20 minutes you've got to look at it -LRB- the shuttle -RRB-, make sure it's there and all that,'' he said before launch. `` And I'm not the only one There's a lot of them that do that with binoculars. They sit here all night. They know it's there but you've got to keep reassuring yourself.'' Many people were sleeping in cars parked along side <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> 1 as the sun rose Thursday. Lines grew long at restrooms at gas stations and restaurants after they woke up. By midmorning, traffic in <LOCATION> Titusville </LOCATION> had slowed to a trickle as attention turned eastward, toward the shuttle, which could be seen across <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Mette-Mari </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolden </PERSON>, 23, of <ORGANIZATION> Larvik </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>, prolonged her stay in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to see Discovery's launch. `` It will probably be something I'll have a memory of for the rest of my life,'' she said. <PERSON> Woody </PERSON> <PERSON> Poynter </PERSON>, 32, of <LOCATION> Sacramento </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, flew into <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION> Wednesday, where he was unable to find a car to rent. The cab driver who picked him up at the airport, however, offered to drive him to <LOCATION> Titusville </LOCATION> when he came with his family. The crowds along the <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> overlooking the space center counted down the final few seconds with a <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> announcer heard on radios and broke into shouts of encouragement as Discovery lifted off. They quieted down when the spaceship disappeared behind a layer of clouds, but the yells began again when it reappeared and became louder when the crowds heard the announcement at 2 minutes, 4 seconds after launch that the boosters had separated. A booster flaw was blamed for the Challenger accident. Moments later, the crowds began heading for their cars and home. <PERSON> Joan </PERSON> <PERSON> Heller </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the <LOCATION> Brevard </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> Sheriff's office said shortly after launch that she guessed about a quarter-million people were on hand, although no formal count is attempted `` It's about the same size or smaller than the first launch, larger than the most recent launches, but not nearly as big as anticipated,'' she said. No arrests, major traffic problems or health problems were reported. Three <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> senators and about 20 congressmen traveled from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> to watch the launch. Among them were the three lawmakers who have flown in space: Sen. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Ohio </LOCATION>, the first American to orbit the Earth, and Sen. <PERSON> Jake </PERSON> <PERSON> Garn </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Utah </LOCATION>, and Rep. <PERSON> Bill </PERSON> <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Fla </LOCATION>., both of whom have flown on shuttle flights Some 2,000 government officials, dignitaries and other <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> guests watched the launch at a VIP viewing site about 6 -LCB- miles away from the launchpad. Actor <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Travola </PERSON>, who said he'd love to go into space, was among them. `` It's a frontier that has hope and future, and that's important to all of us as a group,'' said <PERSON> Travolta </PERSON>, who said he is an avid jet pilot.

 Only half the elementary and secondary school students in this country take world history courses, according a panel of scholars that said Thursday an educational `` crisis'' is creating a nation of historical illiterates. And the little history that is taught often is `` seriously inadequate,'' according to the <ORGANIZATION> Bradley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> on History in Schools. `` History should not just be a mad dash through the centuries with teachers trying desperately to get to the 1980s before school lets out in June,'' said <PERSON> Kenneth </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Mellon </ORGANIZATION> professor of history and social sciences at <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, and chairman of the commission. `` If history is to be properly taught and understood, teachers must have enough time to provide context for facts and training in critical judgment based upon evidence,'' he said. The 17-member panel of university historians and public school teachers released a report, `` Building a History Curriculum: Guidelines for Teaching History in Schools,'' in which it urged that history be required of all students whether or not they are preparing for college. `` History is in crisis _ when half of our students do not study any European history or world history, and one child in seven does n't study American history is it any wonder they do n't know what side <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> was on in World War II or know what we mean by the Holocaust?'' <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> told a news conference Thursday. The commission was created in 1987 in response to widespread concern over `` the inadequacy, both in quantity and quality, of the history taught in American elementary and secondary schools.'' The report said the number of required courses in history had declined while other social disciplines and new fields _ sex and health education, driver education and computer education _ expanded their roles in the basic public school curriculum. It noted that four states require world history for high school graduation, 12 states have an optional or combination world history requirement, while 34 have no world history requirement and four more have no <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> history requirement. Although these courses may be offered or required by local school districts, there are no across-the-board state requirements. `` When we look at the level of debate in this -LRB- presidential -RRB- campaign we can see one of the consequences of having a historically illiterate public,'' said <PERSON> Diane </PERSON> <PERSON> Ravitch </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` It's pointless to talk about ` a New Deal Democrat' when the public does n't know what the New Deal was. `` One of the major candidates is not quite sure when <LOCATION> Pearl </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> was. At least he knows what <LOCATION> Pearl </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> was,'' she said. <PERSON> Ravitch </PERSON> outlined the commission's recommendation that social studies in grades kindergarten through 6 be history-centered and that local and state school districts require the study of history during four of the six years in grades 7 through 12. Other recommendations included: _ The inclusion of the historical experiences of women, racial and ethnic minorities in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Americas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> in all curricula _ Elementary and secondary social studies curricula that provide a core of history and geography _ Social studies teachers in middle and high schools must have completed a substantial history program at the college or university level _ University history departments should offer survey courses featuring world history, Western civilizaton and American history _ Local school boards and supervisors should give teachers authority to design their own courses and methods and teach from their own individual strengths _ Textbook publishers should stop overloading their schoolbooks with facts and go back to telling a good story, built around questions that are meaningful to students

 When Chief Buffalo called <LOCATION> Chippewa </LOCATION> leaders to <PERSON> Madeline </PERSON> <PERSON> Island </PERSON> to sign a treaty 134 years ago Friday, he wanted to make sure the tribe could stay near the island it considered sacred, his great, great granddaughter said. `` Buffalo would not have signed a treaty if he had believed his children and grandchildren could not enjoy the fruits of the earth,'' said <PERSON> Victoria </PERSON> <PERSON> Gokee </PERSON>, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cliff </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chippewa </ORGANIZATION> band and a local Indian historian. But Chief Buffalo's wishes remain in dispute today. Indians claim in the Treaty of 1854, which ceded lands to the federal government, they retained the rights to hunt, spear fish and gather wild grain in northern <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>. Federal courts agree, but how those rights are exercised is undecided. A hearing on that issue is scheduled next month in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Madison </LOCATION>. Some opponents of treaty rights have called for <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> to abrogate the agreements, arguing the treaties are outdated and unfair. Each spring, tensions over the treaty rise as Chippewas spear walleyes prized by sportsmen. In an interview on the mainland, with <PERSON> Madeline </PERSON> <PERSON> Island </PERSON> in the background, <PERSON> Gokee </PERSON>, 57, retold the story passed down from her ancestors describing the gold and promises at the Treaty of 1854 signing. The treaty was the last in a series of agreements that the Lake Superior band of <LOCATION> Chippewa </LOCATION> made with the federal government. More than 100 Indians rowed or took canoes or other boats to the <LOCATION> Lake </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Superior </LOCATION> island where federal government agents met them with barrels of whiskey and gold, <PERSON> Gokee </PERSON> said. Each Indian was supposed to receive a cup of gold, she said. She said, according to her grandfather, the Indians never received the gold. In <PERSON> Gokee </PERSON>'s view, the anniversary of the signing is not much to celebrate. `` We never were the ones who wanted a treaty and with every treaty we lost something,'' she said. Fear of losing their proximity to <PERSON> Madeline </PERSON> <PERSON> Island </PERSON> was the reason why <LOCATION> Buffalo </LOCATION> signed the 1854 treaty that promised reservations for what are now 14 bands of the tribe that live in <LOCATION> Wisconsin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, she said. Then-President <PERSON> Zachary </PERSON> <PERSON> Taylor </PERSON> had issued an order for the Chippewas to leave the land, despite earlier treaties that allowed the <ORGANIZATION> Indians </ORGANIZATION> to remain on the land unless they misbehaved. `` Buffalo could n't bear to leave the burial grounds'' on the island, <PERSON> Gokee </PERSON> said. The island was also considered sacred by the tribe because of <LOCATION> Chippewa </LOCATION> legends and the Medewin religion, she said. According to legend, a woman on the island had placed her baby in a cradleboard on a tree and the child disappeared. `` They say ... he returned to the island as an old man years and years later,'' <PERSON> Gokee </PERSON> said. The legend says the spirits taught the child the code of the Medewin religion, which he then taught to the <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> people, <PERSON> Gokee </PERSON> said. In another legend, the <LOCATION> Chippewa </LOCATION> tribe was supposed to be where a shell-shaped light shone in the sky, she said. The light had been with the tribe many, many years ago farther east, but it disappeared and hardships followed, according to the legend. Tribal elders sent scouts to find it and the light's final resting place was over <LOCATION> Madeline </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Gokee </PERSON> said. Some non-Indians living on the island still speak of the light today, said <PERSON> Gokee </PERSON>. She said she has never seen it.

 Relieved members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> hailed the successful launch of the space shuttle Discovery on Thursday as a rebirth of the nation's exploration of space. Several senators watched the launch on television sets in the Republican and Democratic cloakrooms, then walked to the floor to applaud the achievement. `` After nearly three years of down time, after thousands of design changes, the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> space shuttle Discovery has just blasted off from <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canaveral </LOCATION>, returning <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> to space,'' Sen. <PERSON> Howell </PERSON> <PERSON> Heflin </PERSON>, D-Ala., said to a gallery filled with visitors He praised the thousands of people involved in the work of preparing Discovery for launch and said: `` Today their work for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> has succeeded.'' `` The numbing tragedy of January 28, 1986 ... is still fresh in ur minds and weighs heavily on our hearts,'' <PERSON> Heflin </PERSON> said in referecne to the explosion that destroyed the shuttle Challenger and killed its seven crew members. But he said the nation was right in refusing to be discouraged by the accident, which had grounded the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> manned spaceflight program. `` Not exploring the limitless bounds of space would constitute a tragedy greater than the one we experienced in 1986,'' <PERSON> Heflin </PERSON> said. `` Space is the greatest adventure of our times, and any nation that sees itself as a great leader can not and must not ignore it.'' `` We're back in space,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Ernest </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hollings </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-S.C. </LOCATION>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> space committee that oversees the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>. `` And more than anything else this reaffirms our commitment,'' he said. `` The commitment has been questioned for the last two years. But now we're back, and with that commitment, we'll attract the best and the brightest to the program.'' Sen. <PERSON> Thad </PERSON> <PERSON> Cochran </PERSON>, D-Miss., said `` This is a day when we can all take pride in our country. `` It is a great day for the exploration of the universe,'' <PERSON> Heflin </PERSON> added. Senate Republican leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Kansas </LOCATION> strode from the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> cloakroom minutes after the launch to report to Sen. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shelby </PERSON>, D-Ala., who was presiding `` Straight up, about 100 miles up,'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> said with a grin. How long is the mission? <PERSON> Shelby </PERSON> asked. `` Four days, one hour,'' <PERSON> Dole </PERSON> replied. And then referring to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>' struggle to adjourn for the year, he added: `` They are going to stay up there until we leave.''

 More than 1,000 journalists at a remote press site cheered Discovery's majestic liftoff Thursday, but also expressed disappointment that new safety rules prevented them from a closer view. `` Tremendous! It's more than I thought,'' said an excited <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> with a public television station in <LOCATION> Houston </LOCATION>, seconds after viewing his first launch. Prompted by <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> concerns that the Complex 39 press site could be bombarded by falling debris if the solid rocket boosters malfunctioned, only 1,800 reporters were allowed to work from the main press site. The new rules forced <PERSON> Miller </PERSON> and other reporters to view the liftoff at the alternate press site, more than six miles away from the from Discovery's launchpad. Despite the spectacular liftoff, reporters at the remote site were envious of their colleagues who viewed the launch from only four miles away and expressed fears that additional restrictions may follow. `` I hope this is not indicative of a trend,'' said <PERSON> Miller </PERSON>, who called the new measures `` indirect censorship.'' `` I still wish I was over there -LRB- main press site -RRB-. It was still a thrill. I'm glad nothing happened,'' said <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> <PERSON> Occhiuzzo </PERSON> of the Fort Lauderdale News and <ORGANIZATION> Sun-Sentinel </ORGANIZATION>. Most of the journalists arrived at the mosquito-infested site before dawn after driving in bumper-to-bumper traffic for up to two hours from <LOCATION> Titusville </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cocoa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>. While awaiting the liftoff, journalists slept, and chatted. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Hartman </PERSON>, former host of <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` Good Morning America,'' passed a football to his sons as he awaited the liftoff. Reporters complained the lack of telephones, electricity and work space limited their usefulness at the remote site. `` There is no way to get a story filed in a timely manner,'' said <PERSON> Beverly </PERSON> <PERSON> Keneagy </PERSON> of The <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> Times-Union of <LOCATION> Jacksonville </LOCATION>. Daily newspapers were allowed to have just two people at the main press site.

<HEAD>Market Stabilization Prices for Sugar Up Slightly</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The `` market stabilization price'' of raw cane sugar in the 1989 fiscal year that begins Oct. 1 will be up slightly to 21.8 cents per pound, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday. Acting Underscretary <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldberg </PERSON> said the new rate compares with 21.76 cents per pound in the current year. The MSP, as it is called, is a market price objective, a computed level at or above which producers would be more likely to repay price support loans and sell their sugar in the marketplace. If market prices are below the <ORGANIZATION> MSP </ORGANIZATION>, producers are inclined to forfeit their sugar to the government instead of paying off their price support loans. Included in the computation for the <ORGANIZATION> MSP </ORGANIZATION> is the government's price support loan rate of 18 cents per pound, plus allowances for transportation costs and interests on loans to make the total of 21.8 cents per pound

 Soldiers on the front lines of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>' 40 - year quest for peace won the 1988 Nobel Peace Prize on Thursday for steadfast duty in the cross fire of the world's The Nobel Committee said the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping troops built greater faith in the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, which `` has come to play a more central part in world affairs.'' <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> leaders praised the award but appealed again for the release of a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> kidnapped while serving with <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeepers in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The award could bolster new <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacemaking efforts to oversee shaky truce agreements in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. In <LOCATION> Jerusalem </LOCATION>, peacekeepers broke open bottles of champagne to celebrate the prestigious award as the word was passed by radio from outpost to outpost. Five of the seven peacekeeping forces are in the <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION>. `` We are here to keep the peace, but winning the Nobel prize makes you feel good,'' said Canadian trooper <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Mayfield </PERSON>, 22, who guards a crossing point between Greek and Turkish sectors of <LOCATION> Nicosia </LOCATION>, the capital of <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION>. Nearly 10,000 peacekeepers from more than 30 countries serve under the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> flag. Peacekeepers most recently were dispatched to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Iraq </LOCATION> under a cease-fire negotiated in the countries' 8-year-long war `` There is great joy,'' said <PERSON> Timor </PERSON> <PERSON> Goskel </PERSON>, spokesman for the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interim </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. He spoke from <ORGANIZATION> UNIFIL </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> Naqoura </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. The citation from the <ORGANIZATION> Nobel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION>, made up of five Norwegians, said the troops showed the world's determination to settle disputes peacefully. It said they `` made a decisive contribution towards the initiation of actual peace negotiations.'' Some peacekeepers carry light arms, but they can fire only in self-defense. The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> says 733 peacekeepers have lost their lives since 1948. Lt. Col. <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, who headed the 76-member <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> supervision group in <LOCATION> south </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>, is among nine American hostages in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, 43, was seized Feb. 17. `` For us, it is a No. 1 priority that this officer who was serving the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, who was wearing the blue beret when he was kidnapped, should be released without delay,'' said <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Undersecretary-General <PERSON> Marrack </PERSON> <PERSON> Goulding </PERSON>. The prize was an indirect tribute to Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON>, who was not eligible because he was nominated after the Feb. 1 deadline. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON>, speaking to applause at the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said the Nobel committee showed `` that the quest for peace is a universal undertaking involving all the nations and peoples of the world.'' The <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> chief said he would accept the prize in <LOCATION> Oslo </LOCATION> on Dec. 10, the anniversary of benefactor <PERSON> Alfred </PERSON> <PERSON> Nobel </PERSON>'s death in 1896. Nobel was the inventor of dynamite. The prize carries a cash award of 2.5 million Swedish kronor, worth $ 390,000 today. <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> officials did not say how the money would be used. The peacekeeping operations cost about $ 230 million a year, and officials say that likely additional operations in southern <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sahara </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cambodia </LOCATION> will raise the total to $ 1.5 billion to $ 2 billion annually. <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> chairman <PERSON> Egil </PERSON> <PERSON> Aarvik </PERSON> confirmed that President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> were among the 97 candidates and were `` seriously considered'' for the prize. He did not explain the committee's decision. But he said when asked if the presidential election was a factor: `` Yes, we take everything into consideration, also that.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> congratulated the peacekeeping forces. `` No, I did n't deserve it as much -LRB- as they did -RRB-,'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told reporters at the White House. `` It was an admirable decision.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> were nominated for signing a treaty to dismantle land-based intermediate-range missiles, the first accord to reduce the superpowers' nuclear arsenals. <PERSON> Aarvik </PERSON> told reporters he hoped the prize would `` give the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> and the forces increased prestige.'' The award reflected a trend adopted by the committee of trying to use the coveted prize to influence events. Last year the panel made no secret that it wanted to encourage the Central American peace process by giving the prize to Costa Rican President <PERSON> Oscar </PERSON> <PERSON> Arias </PERSON>. The award comes at a time of growing respectibility but mounting financial difficulty for the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, despite <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s decision to lift a suspension of more than $ 500 million the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> owed in dues In <LOCATION> Scandinavia </LOCATION> alone, the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> forces are in arrears to <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> for $ 36 million and to <LOCATION> Finland </LOCATION> for $ 22.5 million. <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION> pulled out of the <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> peace force last year to protest the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION>'s failure to pay for the troops, but stayed in other forces. It was the fifth time that a U.N.-related body won the peace prize since it was first awarded in 1901. It also was the 16th time that an organization rather than a person has won the prize. Previous winners included the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> High Commissioner for Refugees, <ORGANIZATION> Amnesty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cross </ORGANIZATION>. The Nobel prizes for medicine, economics, physics and chemistry are to be announced next month in <LOCATION> Stockholm </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sweden </LOCATION>.

 Artists upset with a pumpkin festival have found a way to fight back _ with a squash fete. <PERSON> Katie </PERSON> <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON> and other local artists are angry that out-of-towners have taken over the 18th Annual Half Moon Bay Art and Pumpkin Festival. The sponsors include <ORGANIZATION> Safeway </ORGANIZATION>, Chevrolet, Budweiser and General Foods. `` The pumpkin festival has taken on a corporate life of its own,'' said <PERSON> Murdoch </PERSON>, a history teacher. So, she organized the First Annual Squash Festival. The pumpkin festival attracts more than 300,000 people during its weekend run in mid-October. The main attraction are works of art made from pumpkins. The squash festival will feature 30 local artists displaying everything from landscape paintings to kelp baskets and something known as a `` fish print,'' images made from living fish. The festivals will go head-to-head. Both are set for the Oct. 15-16 weekend.

<HEAD>Easing of Emigration Restrictions Planned, Officials Say</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Soviet officials have informed the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> they plan to ease restrictions that prevent many Soviet citizens from emigrating, the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday. Spokeswoman <PERSON> Phyllis </PERSON> <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> said the Soviets spelled out their position last week in two days of talks during the visit here of Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>. `` We welcome the reform process under way in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Oakley </PERSON> said, noting that the Soviets promised to allow free emigration in a 1975 agreement. She added, however, with even with these changes, not all individuals will be able to exercise their right to leave the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. She said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> will continue to urge the Soviets to uphold their commitments. According to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> estimates, Soviet Jews have been emigrating at the rate of 2,000 per month this year and the total for 1988 could be the highest since 51,000 emigrated in 1979. American officials, insisting on anonymity, said the Soviets plan to repeal a requirement that Soviet citizens receive an invitation to leave from close family members living abroad as a condition for their departure. Another proposal would waive the current requirement that a child receive parental approval to leave the country, the officials said.

<HEAD>Hospitalization Goes Down This Decade For Four Cancers</HEAD>
<NOTE>Eds: For release 6:30 p.m. EDT</NOTE>
<BYLINE>By ROBERT BYRD</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Federal health officials said Thursday that hospitalization rates have fallen in the 1980s for four major types of cancer, even though the number of people suffering from the diseases has not fallen in all cases. The national <ORGANIZATION> Centers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disease </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> reported that hospitalization rates for breast cancer, lung cancer, colon and rectal cancer, and cervical cancer all have declined during the decade. The rates are calculated by looking at records of hospital discharges. Hospitalization rates do not necessarily reflect trends in the numbers of people with various cancers, said Dr. <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Mendlein </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> researcher. Some cancers may require more follow-up hospital stays than others, and the effort to cut the cost of health care also can influence the number of times a patient is hospitalized, he noted. `` This gives you just one measure of the health care impact -LRB- of various cancers -RRB-,'' <PERSON> Mendlein </PERSON> said. The drop in hospitalization rates parallels the drop in the rate of occurrence of cervical cancer, colorectal cancer and male lung cancer, <PERSON> Mendlein </PERSON> said. On the other hand, while hospitalizations for breast cancer and female lung cancer are declining somewhat, the incidence of those two diseases continues to increase, he said. For 1986, the latest year for which figures are available, the <ORGANIZATION> CDC </ORGANIZATION> estimates hospital discharge rates as: _ Breast cancer, 172 per 100,000 people, down from a peak of 199 in 1983 _ Lung cancer, male, 142 per 100,000, down from a peak of 182 in 1984 _ Lung cancer, female, 83 per 100,000, down from a peak of 100 in 1983 _ Colorectal cancer, 86 per 100,000, down from a peak of 92 in 1981 _ Cervical cancer, 46 per 100,000, down from a peak of 89 in 1976 A <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cancer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> report earlier this year put breast cancer at its highest rate in history, and it is still the leading cause of cancer death among women. Lung cancer, the leading cause of cancer deaths overall, is increasing among women and decreasing among men. When studying hospital discharge rates, `` incidence or occurrence is just one of the forces,'' <PERSON> Mendlein </PERSON> said. `` There are other, economic forces as well.'' He noted that such factors as shifts in Medicare policy and trends in outpatient treatment could change the rates of hospital visits for various diseases.

<HEAD>NASA Launch Officials Waived Guidelines to Enable Liftoff</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> launch supervisors met Thursday morning to consider the effect of lighter-than-normal winds and chose to waive agency guidelines that would have prohibited the space shuttle's late-morning liftoff. `` The winds did not violate our safety factor,'' said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Utsman </PERSON>, deputy director of the Kennedy Space Center. Nonetheless, he confirmed, `` It did require a waiver'' of launch rules. `` It was n't taken lightly,'' he said. `` It was not a result of a judgment, but a refined engineering analysis.'' <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Crippen </PERSON>, the veteran astronaut who heads a new launch oversight team, convened his unit to consider the waiver, officials said. Waivers are controversial because investigations of the Challenger disaster indicated that officials had granted waivers that allowed the flawed booster rockets to continue flying without redesign. Thursday's dilemma arose because weather officers expected a shuttle to hit autumn headwinds of nearly 100 miles an hour between 20,000 and 50,000 feet as it climbed to orbit. Spacecraft computers were programmed to permit the shuttle to operate in this environment, responding to the winds with spacecraft changes designed to keep the ship safe and on course. But weather balloons launched Wednesday indicated y were coming from, combined with the computer program, could cause damage to tiles on the leading edge of Discovery's wings. A computer program devised for spring-season flights would have provided data to compensate for the light winds, officials said. It was too late to change the computer program for a launch on Thursday, so engineers worked through the night to reconsider the wind rules they had set for Discovery's launch. It's something engineers call a model. `` Our model was very conservative,'' said <PERSON> Utsman </PERSON>. `` We were able to refine our model and found we have 4 to 5 percent more structural margin.'' That, he said, would provide enough of a safety margin for Discovery's computer if the winds would just shift to a more westerly direction. But a balloon dispatched early today indicated the wind was still from the northeast, unacceptable for launch. Another balloon two hours later showed a gradual shift to the northwest, and a slight decrease in velocity, moves that continued through subsequent balloon flights. <PERSON> Utsman </PERSON> said the combination of reduced winds and their shift in direction enabled engineers to feel comfortable they could launch under terms of the new model. Launch was delayed 98 minutes, but took place at 11:37 a.m. EDT.

I would like to take this opportunity to repeat an appeal, which has been made so often in the past, to those who are holding him to release him without delay,'' said <PERSON> Goulding </PERSON>. <PERSON> Goulding </PERSON>'s call for <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>' release was the only somber note at the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>. `` Everybody from the 38th floor to the basement is delighted'' that the Nobel Committee awarded the Peace Prize to <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeepers worldwide, said <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON>. <PERSON> Goulding </PERSON> had no comment on how the $ 390,000 prize will be used. If the prize money is donated to <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping budgets, it wo n't make much of a dent in the peacekeeping deficits. On Aug. 31, <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> documents show that members owed $ 325 million to the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Interim </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> In <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION> and owed the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Disengagement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Observer </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> on the <LOCATION> Golan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Heights </LOCATION> and the U.N.

Members also owed the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> force in <LOCATION> Cyprus </LOCATION> $ 158.1 million by the end of July, said <PERSON> Goulding </PERSON>. He estimated 400,000 to 500,000 people have worn the blue helmet or beret of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping force, and said 9,991 soldiers now are in the force, supported by about 2,000 civilian personnel. All were honored by the award. `` In awarding the Peace Prize to the peacekeeping forces of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> today, the <ORGANIZATION> Nobel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> recognizes that the quest for peace is a universal undertaking involving all the nations and peoples of the world,'' <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> said in a statement to the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Urquhart </PERSON>, the former undersecretary-general in charge of <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping who retired in 1986, said the award honors the 733 soldiers who died on observer missions. `` But it is also a recognition of this important pioneering concept, which uses military personnel in a non-violent role to promote peace, an idea whose time has come and will go far,'' he said. <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> has invited <PERSON> Urquhart </PERSON> and <PERSON> Goulding </PERSON> to accompany him to <LOCATION> Oslo </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>, to accept the prize Dec. 10 on behalf of the peacekeepers, said <PERSON> Giuliani </PERSON>. <PERSON> Goulding </PERSON> said <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> is making `` continuous and vigorous efforts with all those who may have influence with those who are holding Col. <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> to get him released,'' he added.

<HEAD>Spain Keeps Detective From Testifying In IRA Inquest, Witness Says</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Spanish authorities are preventing a police detective from testifying about three <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> guerrillas he trailed through <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> before they came to <LOCATION> Gibraltar </LOCATION>, where British commandos killed them, a witness said Wednesday. <LOCATION> Gibraltar </LOCATION> police Inspector <PERSON> Manolo </PERSON> <PERSON> Correa </PERSON> told an inquest that the unidentified Spanish officer had sent him a statement expressing a desire to testify about the March 6 slayings. But <PERSON> Correa </PERSON> said the officer told him several days ago his superiors would not let him testify. <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> maintains a long dispute with <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> for the return of sovereignty over <LOCATION> Gibraltar </LOCATION>, a British colony at the southern tip of <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>. It was ceded to <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> in 1713. News reports in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> have indicated the <LOCATION> Spanish </LOCATION> police kept the three <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> members under surveillance until they crossed into the colony, hours before being shot. <PERSON> Correa </PERSON>'s testimony came on the 17th day of an inquest by <PERSON> Gibraltar </PERSON> <PERSON> Coroner </PERSON> <PERSON> Felix </PERSON> <PERSON> Pizzarello </PERSON> and an 11-man jury into the shooting deaths of <PERSON> Mairead </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrell </PERSON>, 31, <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> McCann </PERSON>, 30, and <PERSON> Sean </PERSON> <PERSON> Savage </PERSON>, 24. Pizarello, after hearing <PERSON> Correa </PERSON>'s testimony, ordered that a new effort be made to seek the Spanish lawman's testimony. The <ORGANIZATION> IRA </ORGANIZATION> has acknowledged the three victims were on `` active service,'' meaning they were on a mission to strike at British targets at the time of their deaths. British commandos have claimed that they killed the three unarmed guerrillas because they feared the guerrillas were about to detonate a radio-controlled bomb in a car parked about a mile away.

<HEAD>Gacy Execution Years Away Despite Court Ruling, Prosecutor Says</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday upheld <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Gacy </PERSON>'s 1980 convictions and death sentence in the sex-related killings of 33 young men and boys, but prosecutors said years of appeals remain likely. `` <PERSON> Gacy </PERSON> is not at the head of the line -LRB- for execution -RRB-. I wish he was,'' said <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Sweeney </PERSON>, chief of death-penalty litigation for the <LOCATION> Cook </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> state's attorney's office, who called <PERSON> Gacy </PERSON> `` the best illustration of why we have the death penalty in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>.'' Thursday's ruling, issued without written dissent, marked the second time the state's highest court has turned down an appeal by <PERSON> Gacy </PERSON>, convicted of more murders than anyone else in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> history. Unless the state justices agree to reconsider their ruling _ a request that is rarely granted _ the 46-year-old <PERSON> Gacy </PERSON> has exhausted his appeals in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION> courts. However, he still can pursue a lengthy appeals process in the federal courts. The latest court decision comes nearly a decade after the gruesome discovery of 27 bodies of young men and boys in a crawl space of <PERSON> Gacy </PERSON>'s suburban <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> home. Two more bodies were found elsewhere on the property and four were recovered from nearby rivers. The former contractor and amateur clown told police that he had strangled all but one of his victims by wrapping rope around their necks and twisting it with a stick, and that he had had sex with some of his victims before killing them. <PERSON> Gacy </PERSON> was sentenced to death for 12 killings, and to life in prison for the remaining 21. He also was convicted of deviate sexual assault and taking indecent liberties with a child, but was not sentenced on those charges. The convictions and death sentence were first affirmed by the <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in June 1984, and the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> refused to hear his appeal in March 1985. A <LOCATION> Cook </LOCATION> <LOCATION> County </LOCATION> circuit judge refused to grant <PERSON> Gacy </PERSON> a new post-trial hearing in September 1986. In Thursday's ruling, the state <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> rejected arguments that defense testimony at <PERSON> Gacy </PERSON>'s trial was improperly restricted, and that his trial attorney failed to present evidence at a death penalty hearing that might have spared <PERSON> Gacy </PERSON> from a death sentence. The court noted that while psychiatrists testifying for the defense were not allowed to quote from statements by <PERSON> Gacy </PERSON>, they were allowed to paraphrase statements on which they based their conclusions. The justices also noted that mitigating evidence, such as <PERSON> Gacy </PERSON>'s warm relationship with his family and friends and his good behavior in prison, had been presented at trial to the same jury that imposed the death penalty `` We believe that -LRB- defense -RRB- counsel could reasonably have believed that jurors would not have been impressed, and might actually have been irritated by a pointless rehash of the lengthy testimony they had already heard at trial,'' Justice <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Clark </PERSON> wrote in the court's opinion. The court set a Jan. 11, 1989, execution date, which would be extended by appeals. <PERSON> Gacy </PERSON> is one of more than 100 men on death row in <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>, which has not conducted an execution since 1962.

<HEAD>Wright Claims Republican Vendetta, But GOP Says He's Ducking Issue</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JIM DRINKARD</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 House Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> accused Republicans on Thursday of carrying out a political vendetta against him, but the minority countered that <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> was simply trying to duck charges that he improperly disclosed classified information. The comments came as angry personal charges flew back and forth between leadership figures of both sides of the political aisle. `` I've never seen this thing get out of control like it is now,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>, the Democrats' No. 3 leadership official in the chamber. <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> accused <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> leaders of trying to `` tear down the institution'' and of caving in to right-wing elements of their party who seek to embarrass <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>. `` The relationship between the parties is very strained,'' agreed Rep. <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Wyoming </LOCATION>, the chamber's third-ranking Republican. He said exchanges were far more acerbic than normal. <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Texas </LOCATION>, told reporters that <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> efforts to have the ethics committee investigate whether he violated <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> rules by talking publicly last week about a <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> covert action in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> are groundless and motivated by politics. `` It is really very sad that people will try to use the ethics committee, or any other committee of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION>, as a cat's paw to try to carry out a partisan political vendetta against another member,'' he said. `` I can take it,'' <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> said. `` As speaker, I'm in the kitchen, and I'm not offering to get out.'' But Republicans called Democratic counteroffensive a dodge, and said <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> simply was seeking to escape the consequences of his mistake by stirring up a partisan smokescreen. `` The speaker's most recent transgressions have energized a lot of us on our side,'' <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> said. `` I do n't think the House can duck this. They -LRB- Democrats -RRB- know they've got a problem.'' Some moderate Democrats were saying privately that while they were proud of the legislative record of the 100th <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> under <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>'s leadership, they were uncomfortable with his highly visible role in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomacy toward <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. That role assumed center stage again last week when <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>, in response to a reporter's question, said he had `` clear testimony'' from the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> agents had sought to prompt civil unrest in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> to provoke a crackdown by the leftist <ORGANIZATION> Sandinista </ORGANIZATION> government and scuttle peace talks. <LOCATION> Cheney </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Minority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Michel </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-Ill </LOCATION>., quickly asked for intelligence and ethics investigations of <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> to determine whether he had violated House rules against disclosure of classified material Members in both parties saw the participation of <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> _ who for years has taken a less confrontational tack in dealing with the majority _ as a turning point in <ORGANIZATION> Democrat-Republican </ORGANIZATION> relations in the chamber. The tensions surfaced on the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> floor Thursday after one Democratic lawmaker, Rep. <PERSON> Pat </PERSON> <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Montana </LOCATION>, denounced <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential nominee <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> for `` hypocrisy'' in voting against the <ORGANIZATION> Job </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION>, then telling <ORGANIZATION> Job </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> recruits at a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> campaign appearance that `` We believe in you.'' Republican members bristled, and demanded that <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> be ruled out of order. <PERSON> Williams </PERSON> then asked that his remarks be stricken from the record, but in so doing repeated the hypocrisy charge at least three times. Seeking to deal with the <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> controversy, the <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> met Wednesday and declined, on a party-line vote, to turn over to the ethics committee relevant classified information. Democrats reasoned that there was no obligation to do so because the material had not yet been requested officially. In a statement issued Thursday, <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> said the lack of action compelled him to ask Republican members of the <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> to prepare a confidential report to him outlining their recommendations on what to do about the allegations concerning <PERSON> Wright </PERSON>. He said that could lead to a request for unspecified action by the full <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> `` to guarantee the integrity of <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> rules and procedures.'' <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>, D-Calif., said the intelligence meeting was forced by Republicans, who knew the panel would have to decline to release the information `` What you have now is an effort that's very political, very aggressive and loaded with grenades,'' he said, attributing the whole controversy to Republican frustration over being the minority party in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> since 1956. `` The Republicans' problem in the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> is that we do n't take them seriously, Republicans in the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> do n't take them seriously and the <ORGANIZATION> White </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> does n't take them seriously,'' <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON> added. `` I wonder what <PERSON> Tony </PERSON>'s smoking?'' <PERSON> Cheney </PERSON> said when apprised of the comments. `` The real problem is the speaker, and the way he operates. ... He's trashed the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION>, damaged <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> foreign policy in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. ... All of <PERSON> Tony </PERSON> <PERSON> Coelho </PERSON>'s blue smoke and mirrors wo n't change that.

<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> drivers union voted overwhelmingly Thursday to strike television and film producers, with the walkout set to begin Monday. Teamsters Local 399 voted 1,441-196 to reject the latest contract presented by the <ORGANIZATION> Alliance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Picture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Producers </ORGANIZATION>, according to Teamster secretary-treasurer <PERSON> Earl </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` Hopefully, with this kind of rejection, the alliance will take another look'' at the offer, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said. He added, however, that he was not optimistic that the two sides would settle their differences at a Friday bargaining session. Both sides have been asked by a federal mediator to resume negotiations Friday. But the producers contend their terms are final and that there is no room for more bargaining. Key issues include overtime rules, salary rates and guidelines for the making of non-union films. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has called the producers' offer `` the worst contract offer ever made to a union. If the <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> walk out Monday, it will mark the second entertainment industry strike this year. The Writers Guild of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> struck from March until August, and <LOCATION> Hollywood </LOCATION> production is only now returning to full speed. Alliance spokesman <PERSON> Herb </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> said the strike by the 2,200-member <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> union local would not cripple the film and television industry. `` We have trained drivers and we're ready to continue production under any circumstances,'' <PERSON> Steinberg </PERSON> said. `` I do n't think it will have any impact on production. The studios are very well prepared.'' He said newspaper advertisements for replacement drivers drew an overwhelming response.

 Space shuttle Discovery carried the American flag back into space Thursday after a 32-month absence, its five astronauts riding a 700-foot tail of flame from rockets meticulously redesigned after the Challenger disaster. `` Everyone certainly stood tall today,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Kennedy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> director <PERSON> Forrest </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> McCartney </PERSON> as Discovery settled into orbit, 184 miles above earth. <ORGANIZATION> Mission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> said the ship was `` performing nominally.'' It was the first launch since the Challenger explosion with its toll of seven lives on a cold winter day shocked the nation and stopped the manned space program in its tracks. `` We sure appreciate your all getting us up in orbit the way we should be,'' Discovery's commander, <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> Capt. <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> Hauck </PERSON>, told <ORGANIZATION> Mission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION>. `` We're looking forward to the next four days _ we have a lot to do and we're going to have alot of fun doing it.'' Liftoff was the first and most important milestone, but more was at stake than simply getting into space. The 2 -LCB- - year grounding of the shuttle fleet set back the nation's satellite delivery capability, and release of a communications satellite was the main order of business in orbit, six hours after launch The giant Tracking and Data Relay Satellite is a $ 100-million twin of the craft that was destroyed aboard Challenger. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> praised the launch, saying the shuttle was `` headed into orbit and <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> is back in space.'' He saluted the bravery of the crew and added, `` We ask God to bless this important voyage.'' Launch, at 11:37 a.m. EDT, came only after <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> waived weather guidelines to allow for flight through some lighter-than-usual <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> winds. The 98-minute delay simply heightened the tension as <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> unveiled a spaceship that underwent more than 400 modifications since the Challenger flight. Just how well the Discovery's booster rockets performed in their new design awaited detailed analysis. But <PERSON> J.R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, who directed the work from the <ORGANIZATION> Marshall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flight </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION> said, `` From everything I see, everything looks great.'' <PERSON> Hauck </PERSON>'s veteran flight crew consisted of <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> Col. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Covey </PERSON>, Marine Lt. Col. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hilmers </PERSON>; <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lounge </PERSON>; and <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> `` Pinky'' <PERSON> Nelson </PERSON>. Landing was scheduled for Monday at <ORGANIZATION> Edwards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Base </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. The astronauts had said all along they were treating the mission as a test mission _ a `` shakedown flight,'' in the words of <LOCATION> Covey </LOCATION> _ and they quickly ran into first-flight problems. A water evaporator that provides cooling to the ship during the climb to space and return to <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> was partly clogged with ice. And a device that provides electrial power to move an orbital steering engine was not working. Neither problem was critical. Flight director <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Coen </PERSON> said engineers were devising ways of thawing the evaporator before it is needed again and that backup power was available to turn the steering engine. To the delight of a quarter-million people gathered on river banks and highways and an ecstatic <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> team in Launch Control, Discovery lifted off its seaside pad and streaked into cloudy skies. It remained in view less than a half minute, but the tension was considerable and the sight was unforgettable. Anxiety was highest as the ship went through a 30-second period of severe aerodynamic stress. It was during this stage of the flight that one of Challenger's booster rockets failed and triggered the Jan. 28, 1986 catastrophe, 73 seconds after liftoff. Some television viewers reported what they thought was an errant flame shooting from the left booster rocket about 90 seconds after liftoff. Officials said an analysis revealed a harmless phenomena that causes flame from the exhaust to `` climb'' up the side of the rocket. `` It was not particularily unusual,'' said <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Nesbitt </PERSON>. Cheers rang through Launch Control as the ship lifted, and director <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Sieck </PERSON> kidded his team later: `` I knew you could n't hold it After a few long years you've got to let it out.'' Another <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> official said the firing-room emotion `` dwarfs STS-1 -LRB- the first shuttle flight -RRB- and all the others.'' Discovery, an American flag on its left wing, was making its seventh spaceflight.

<HEAD>Jury Clears Globe Of Libeling Former Governor</HEAD>

<DATELINE>BOSTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION> did not libel then-Gov. <PERSON> Edward </PERSON> <PERSON> J </PERSON>. King when it said in a 1981 column that he tried to influence a judge's sentence in a gang rape case, a jury decided Thursday. After little more than two hours of deliberations, the <ORGANIZATION> Suffolk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> jury decided that the <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION> was wrong when it published a Nov. 8, 1981, column by <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrell </PERSON> saying King had called a judge and demanded harsher sentences in the case. But when asked if <PERSON> King </PERSON> had convinced them that the column `` discredited him in the minds of any considerable and respectable class of the community,'' the jury answered no. Sixteen jurors began deliberating in the 6 -LCB- - year-old case after Judge <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> instructed the panel on libel law The jurors were working on a special verdict slip that posed a series of questions, beginning with whether the column was true. King needed to prevail on each question or else lose his lawsuit. After the verdict, a composed <PERSON> King </PERSON> left the courtroom with his wife, <PERSON> Jody </PERSON>, and his attorney, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Goldman </PERSON>, and declined to say how the verdict might affect his political plans. King had said he would consider running for governor again if he won. `` We did the best we could,'' <PERSON> King </PERSON> said, adding he did not consider the lawsuit a waste of time because `` now we know that something the Globe never retracted was a false statement.'' King, who joined the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> after losing the September 1982 Democratic primary to Gov. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, filed suit in January 1982 against the <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION> and several editorial employees, asking for $ 3.6 million. <PERSON> King </PERSON> said he and his lawyer would decide on an appeal within 30 days. `` It's terrific to have been vindicated. This is a victory for freedom of the press,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Boston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION> attorney <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> Kociubes </PERSON>. `` I always felt I did a good job writing the column,'' said <PERSON> Farrell </PERSON>, who now works as a free-lance public relations agent. The jury heard closing arguments Wednesday after six days of testimony. King testified the column amounted to a charge of obstruction of justice that struck him like `` an ice pick in the ribs'' and caused him to lose sleep on more than 1,000 nights since publication. On cross-examination, <PERSON> King </PERSON> acknowledged that he never publicly denied making the call, and <PERSON> Kociubes </PERSON> argued that <PERSON> King </PERSON>, who was thinking of suing the <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION> before the column, made no showing of financial, social or political harm. <PERSON> Farrell </PERSON> testified he was told about King's purported call to Judge <PERSON> Herbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Abrams </PERSON> by state Treasurer <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Q. </PERSON> <PERSON> Crane </PERSON>, an old friend and a reliable source about <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> politics. <PERSON> Crane </PERSON> testified he was the source, but could not recall who told him about the call. Under libel law, a public figure, such as King, has the burden of showing not only that a publication was false but also that it defamed him. Further, the governor must show that the column was published with `` actual malice'' _ that is, with knowing falsity or with `` reckless disregard'' for the truth. <PERSON> Lynch </PERSON> instructed the jury that `` reckless disregard'' means that <PERSON> Farrell </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> Globe </ORGANIZATION> `` entertained serious doubts about the truth of the statement.'' The judge said such doubt could concern the source, but he said that mere failure to investigate <PERSON> Crane </PERSON>'s tip by itself did not constitute libel.

 Some television viewers were alarmed Thursday to see what looked like flame spewing from the side of a booster rocket after Discovery blasted off, but experts attributed it to a phenomenon of physics and said the shuttle was never in danger. At Goddard Flight Space Center in <LOCATION> Maryland </LOCATION> there were reportedly gasps and moans at what seemed to be flames licking up the shuttle's solid rocket boosters less than a minute before separation from the ship. It looked to some like a ghastly replay of the Challenger disaster in which a flame from a joint in a booster rocket blew up the shuttle 73 seconds into flight. As reporters and people at home, including former space employees, watched televised reruns, calls began pouring into newsrooms while space officials studied tapes to be sure there was no problem. A former <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> employee who did n't want to be identified called the <LOCATION> Beloit </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Kan. </LOCATION>, Daily Call and said <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> apparently was lucky, said Publisher <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Hilt </PERSON>. `` In terms of flames that somebody might report, I do n't have any information,'' said <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Nesbitt </PERSON>, the voice of Kennedy Space Center mission control, where officials who reacted jubilantly to the launch quickly asked booster experts to analyze tapes of the launch as the concerned queries began. But officials of the <ORGANIZATION> Marshall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flight </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>, who are responsible for the operation of the boosters, said the flash was no cause for alarm. `` It's predictable, repeatable,'' said <PERSON> Royce </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, Solid Rocket manager from <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> who was at Kennedy Space Center for the launch. He recalled a similar `` flickering'' after the Discovery's first liftoff in 1984. `` It's just a basic law of physics,'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said, terming it `` reverse flow separation.'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said that as shuttle begins to roll, the booster plumes _ the flame that comes from the bottom of the rockets in normal operation _ sometimes converge and the hot particles recirculate. He compared the visual effect to seeing a man on a speeding motorcycle. Instead of his jacket flapping out behind, it is plastered to his back because of the reverse separation principle. <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON> center director <PERSON> J.R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON> celebrated with a Jamaican cigar and officials said they were confident about the boosters' performance. `` Everything looks normal ... everything looks good,'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said. Divers had reached the reusable boosters and their first `` quick look'' indicated no problems, he said. <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said as soon as the recovery ships towed the boosters to port Friday night, `` We'll look at them almost immediately. `` Everybody wants to look at this first joint, and you're looking at the guy who wants to look at it first.

 The family of three AIDS-exposed hemophiliac brothers who were once barred from school settled a civil rights suit against the school district for more than $ 1.1 million Thursday. Under a settlement between <PERSON> Louise </PERSON> and <PERSON> Clifford </PERSON> <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> and the <ORGANIZATION> DeSoto </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION>, the couple's three sons each will get $ 820 a month for the next 10 years, for a total of nearly $ 100,000 apiece. The parents will each get $ 50,000 now and about $ 300 monthly for 30 years. The total to each parent, including a built-in 3 percent inflation rate, amounts to more than $ 220,000. <PERSON> Judy </PERSON> <PERSON> Kavanaugh </PERSON>, the Rays' attorney, said that as far as she knew it was the first time that damages were won by an AIDS victim for violation of civil rights. The settlement, to be paid by the school district's insurance company, includes an additional $ 387,500 for attorney fees, plus $ 50,000 for court costs. The brothers _ <PERSON> Ricky </PERSON>, 11, <PERSON> Robert </PERSON>, 10, and <PERSON> Randy </PERSON>, 8 _ probably were exposed to the viris that causes acquired immune deficiency syndrome through plasma-based medication to clot their blood. All three have hemophilia, an inherited disease that keeps blood from clotting. None of the boys has developed AIDS, but the oldest, <PERSON> Ricky </PERSON>, has developed AIDS-related complex, which can be a precursor to the deadly disease. He is being treated with the anti-AIDS drug AZT. The two sides outlined details of the agreement in an appearance before <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Elizabeth </PERSON> <PERSON> Kovachevich </PERSON>. She praised both sides for settling the dispute without a trial. The trial had been set to begin Monday in <LOCATION> Fort </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Myers </LOCATION>. The settlement marks the end of the <ORGANIZATION> Rays </ORGANIZATION>' complaint that school officials violated their sons' civil rights by refusing to allow them to attend <ORGANIZATION> Memorial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Arcadia </LOCATION> in 1986 and 1987 for fear of spreading the deadly disease. Experts say the disease can not be spread by casual contact. The boys finally were admitted under federal court order in August 1987 over objections of angry parents, who staged a week-long boycott that cut school attendance in half. At the end of that week, the Rays' home was burned by an unknown arsonist. The family then moved to <LOCATION> Sarasota </LOCATION>, where the boys now attend school. The settlement did not require school officials to admit any negligence in the way the boys or their family were treated, according to <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Westberry </PERSON>, school board chairman. The lawsuit had accused school officials of abusing their power, depriving the boys of their rights because they were handicapped, and helping create an atmosphere of hatred against the boys in <LOCATION> Arcadia </LOCATION>. `` It was better this way, thinking about the length of time involved,'' said Mrs. <PERSON> Ray </PERSON> after the settlement was approved. She said she hopes the school board members `` have learned as much from this situation as we have. You should n't be afraid of someone who has AIDS because you ca n't catch it.

At the time the boys were excluded, school officials contended that not enough was known about AIDS for them to be completely certain there was no risk to other pupils.

<HEAD>Medicare One-Time Hospital Deductible Will Rise to $560 in January</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JERRY ESTILL</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The one-time deductible that <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> beneficaries will have to pay out of their own pockets if hospitalized next year will be $ 560, the <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Human </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> announced Thursday. That is an increase of $ 20 from this year and goes along with a $ 3.10-per-month rise in the optional Part B premium that helps pay doctor bills. Because of new provisions in the catastrophic health insurance law that will take effect Jan. 1, there will be only a one-time hospital deductible for <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> beneficiaries next year no matter how many times they might be hospitalized. Under existing law, the deductible _ $ 540 in 1988 _ could be charged for each hospitalization. The $ 560 deductible for 1989, made official with publication in the Federal Register, is the same amount that had been projected in debate leading up to passage of the catastrophic coverage act. By law, the deductible is pegged to increases in hospital costs, and <ORGANIZATION> HHS </ORGANIZATION> officials had a pretty good idea of how much those costs were rising even before the final, formal tabulations were done. Technically, the deductible would go down if average hospital costs ever fell. The regular Part B premium charged beneficiaries to help cover the cost of doctor bills paid by <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> will increase from the present $ 24.80 a month to $ 27.90. That, too, is in line with earlier projections. <ORGANIZATION> HHS </ORGANIZATION> officials told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> several months ago they estimated the 1989 Part B premium would be about $ 28 a month. In addition to the regular Part B increase that is pegged to program costs already incurred, a flat premium of $ 4 per month to help pay for new benefits under the catastrophic coverage will begin in January, making the premium $ 31.90 per month per person. The $ 4 linked to the increased catastrophic benefits is mandatory, while the $ 27.90 is voluntary. As a practical matter, however, almost all of the 31 million <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> enrollees _ about 98 percent _ voluntary take the Part B doctor bill coverage because it buys protection they could not purchase on the private insurance market at anywhere near the same price. Current law requires that Part B premiums paid by beneficaries must equal 25 percent of the total costs of the physician remimbursement program. The rest is paid by tax revenue. Like the hospital deductible, the Part B premium is adjusted each year according to a formula pegged to actual costs the preceeding year. Part B outlays _ a direct reflection of the amount the nation's doctors charge the federal government for <ORGANIZATION> Medicare </ORGANIZATION> patients _ are the fastest rising segment of the federal budget

<HEAD>Senate Approves First Welfare Overhaul in More Than 50 Years</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By JILL LAWRENCE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> gave a near unanimous stamp of approval Thursday to the first major welfare overhaul in over half a century, seeking to turn the system into a gate of opportunity rather than a long-term trap. `` For the first time in its half-century existence, the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> has moved to an entire redefinition and overhaul of what we've come to know as our welfare system,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Moynihan </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, the leader of the effort. The vote on the final version of the Family Welfare Reform Act was 96-1, with Sen. <PERSON> Jesse </PERSON> <PERSON> Helms </PERSON>, <LOCATION> R-N.C. </LOCATION>, the lone opponent. The bill was headed for <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> approval Friday and from there to the <LOCATION> White </LOCATION> <LOCATION> House </LOCATION>, where President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> has expressed satisfaction with it. The hard-won bipartisan compromise, the result of a summer of seesaw negotiations, centers on a large-scale work, education and training program to be aimed primarily at welfare mothers. Support services such as child care would be available to program participants and those moving into low-wage jobs. `` In early 1987, we had a process that many of us never really thought would be complete,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Minority Leader <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Dole </PERSON>, R-Kan. `` Lo and behold, here we are today with a bill we can support. <PERSON> Moynihan </PERSON> said that under the revamped system, welfare will `` no longer be a permanent or extended condition.'' Instead, he said, the new system will stress work, child support and last-resort cash supplements while encouraging the needy to get the education and training needed to avert long-term dependence. Sen. <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Packwood </PERSON>, R-Ore., a key supporter of the drive, said there's no guarantee the bill will work `` But if it does only half of what we hope, it's an immense step forward,'' he said. `` What we have had does not work. That we can say with certainty.'' The five-year, $ 3.3 billion compromise plan is modeled largely on <PERSON> Moynihan </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> bill, which passed 93-3 in June. Its Job Opportunities and Basic Skills program starts out at $ 600 million in 1989, rising to $ 1.3 billion by 1995, when states would have to be serving 20 percent of eligible recipients. The bill also requires that starting in 1991, all states provide benefits to two-parent unemployed households; only 27 now do so. The other 23 could limit benefits to six months in a 12-month period. The final compromise contains some provisions that <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> liberals found hard to swallow, among them a 16-hour-a-week workfare requirement for one adult in two-parent families receiving welfare. The requirement, effective in 1994, would kick in for that relatively small group only if an intensive two-month job search failed. Conservatives called it the first step toward a wider work requirement while liberals complained bitterly about slavery and punishment. Some discontented <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members were expected to vote against the bill, but they are a minority. The least controversial aspect of the welfare overhaul is its opening section, designed to step up child support payments from non-custodial parents. The section requires automatic wage-withholding when a court awards support and a higher rate of paternity establishment by states. `` It makes a statement about what our society believes the role of parents should be,'' said Sen. <PERSON> Thad </PERSON> <PERSON> Cochran </PERSON>, R-Miss., an original sponsor of the <PERSON> Moynihan </PERSON> bill `` Parents should provide for their children.'' The current welfare system, Aid to Families With Dependent Children, serves 3.7 million families, including 7 million children. <ORGANIZATION> AFDC </ORGANIZATION> costs the federal government about $ 8.5 billion a year in cash benefits.

<HEAD>Farm Prices Up Relatively Modest 0.7 Percent</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Prices farmers got for raw products in September rose 0.7 percent from August, including the highest wheat prices in almost seven years, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday. But the rise from August to September was the smallest monthly increase since the drought began cutting 1988 harvest prospects and triggered rising prices last spring. After holding steady during most of the winter, the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> index rose 3.1 percent from April to May, followed by 2.2 percent in June, 2.9 percent in July and 2.1 percent in August. Mostly as a result of the drought and searing heat during the spring and summer, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> grain production is expected to be down 31 percent from last year's harvest. The department's <ORGANIZATION> Agricultural </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> said in its preliminary report that higher prices for grapefruit, milk and wheat contributed most to the September increase. Lower prices for hogs, oranges and broiler chickens partly offset the rise in other commodities. The September prices averaged 12 percent higher than a year earlier. Prices of some major commodities are based on mid-month averages and then are revised the following month when additional information is available. `` The mid-September prices for corn, soybeans and wheat were higher than the respective averages for the month of August,'' the report said. `` The all-wheat price was at the highest level since November of 1981.'' But the report added that `` hog prices dropped off sharply'' from August and continued well below the high prices sustained during the last half of 1986 and in most of 1987. Prices of meat animals as a group dropped l. 8 percent from August and averaged 3.5 percent below the level of September 1987 Dairy products climbed 3.3 percent from the August price average, overall, but still lagged a year earlier by 3.8 percent, the report said. Milk prices paid to farmers were up 40 cents per 100 pounds from August but were 50 cents below the year-ago level. The department's all-crops price index for September was up 3 percent from August and averaged 32 percent more than a year ago. Soybeans, at $ 8.42 per bushel, were up 9 cents from August, and wheat averaged $ 3.82 per bushel, up 21 cents. Prices of fruit, as an overall average, were up 3.9 percent from August and 2.2 percent from a year ago, the report said. Commercial vegetables were up 4.1 percent from August, averaging 20 percent more than in September 1987. Although the projections are subject to change, <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> economists say that net cash income of farmers may be in the range of $ 55 billion to $ 60 billion this year, compared with the record level of $ 57.1 billion in 1987. That is the difference between cash receipts and cash expenses during the calendar year. Consumer food prices are expected to rise 3 percent to 5 percent this year, compared with a 4.2 percent average increase in 1987. Before the drought took hold, <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> was predicting a 1988 food price hike of 2 percent to 4 percent. Department officials have predicted that the drought may add two percentage points to food prices in 1989, above the expected increase in inflation, currently forecast at around 4 percent. That could mean a 1989 food prices increase in the range of 6 percent to 7 percent. The report did not include new figures showing what farmers pay to meet expenses. Those are reported quarterly, and the most recent figures released in July showed farm production costs were up 2.4 percent from April, averaging 4.9 percent more than in July 1987. The report said: _ Cattle averaged $ 66 per 100 pounds of live weight nationally, up from $ 65.90 in August and $ 63.70 reported for September 1987 Those are averages for all types of cattle sold as beef. _ Hogs averaged $ 40.30 per 100 pounds, compared with $ 44.70 in August and $ 54.30 a year earlier _ Corn, at $ 2.71 a bushel, was up from $ 2.65 in August and the average of $ 1.49 per bushel a year earlier _ Wheat prices at the farm, according to preliminary figures, averaged $ 3.82 per bushel, compared with $ 3.61 in August and $ 2.54 a year earlier _ Rice averaged $ 7.30 per 100 pounds, compared with $ 7.42 in August and $ 4.32 a year earlier _ Soybeans were $ 8.42 per bushel, compared with $ 8.33 in August and $ 5.02 a year earlier _ Upland cotton was reported at 52 cents per pound, compared with 52.6 in August and 64.9 cents in September 1987 _ Eggs were 63.8 cents per dozen, compared with 58.1 cents in August and 58.2 cents a year earlier _ Milk was $ 12.20 per 100 pounds, compared with $ 11.80 in August and $ 12.70 a year earlier _ Broilers were 39.2 cents per pound, live weight, compared with 41.9 cents in August and 31.3 cents a year ago

 <PERSON> Sarah </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, whose husband was shot along with President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> in 1981, said Thursday the majority of <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> members defeated a handgun waiting period because they `` did n't have the guts'' to stand up to the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rifle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> She said the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> `` caved in'' to the <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION>'s lobbying against the legislation in an election year, and added that some lawmakers `` turned tail'' after promising <ORGANIZATION> Handgun </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> they would back the waiting period. Mrs. <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> is vice chair of the gun control organization, which lobbied along with law enforcement organizations for a seven-day waiting period with an optional police background check. Mrs. <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> contended that the <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> leadership, which once supported waiting periods, has become more extreme and no longer represents its membership. <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> president <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Foss </PERSON>, who was in the audience for Mrs. <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>'s talk, said afterwards, `` I'm no extremist. He said the organization's leadership does represent its members, adding, `` I am out there with them. I have a pretty good pulse. `` Whenever you lose, people always say it was n't a fair fight.'' <PERSON> Foss </PERSON>, a former World War II flying ace and a onetime <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Dakota </LOCATION> governor, was elected to a two-year term as <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> president in April. Mrs. <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, the wife of presidential press secretary <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, spoke at the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Club </ORGANIZATION>. Her husband was seriously wounded when shot in the head by <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hinckley </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> in his March 30, 1981, assassination attempt on the president. The <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> voted 228-182 on Sept. 16 to delete the proposed seven-day waiting period from an anti-drug bill, despite the well-coordinated police-gun control group lobbying effort. The vote, which followed a strong <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> campaign against the language, substituted a plan designed to allow gun dealers to quickly identify convicted felons seeking to buy pistols. The House bill ordered the <ORGANIZATION> Justice </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> to devise an identification system in six months and present it to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The Brady forces argued that criminals could easily buy guns in the 28 states without a waiting period, while the <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION> said a waiting period would only hurt law-abiding citizens. While the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> passed the overall drug bill, the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> has yet to consider its own anti-drug legislation. Although both sides concede the chance for a waiting period is dead for the year, senators could decide to approve an identification system. Mrs. <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> said in her speech, `` I'm disappointed at the caliber of members of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> who did n't have the guts to speak up to one of the most powerful lobbies in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. I have experienced the power of the <ORGANIZATION> NRA </ORGANIZATION>.'' Predicting that lawmakers would have less `` fear'' of supporting gun control in a non-election year, Mrs. <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> vowed to try again for the waiting period in 1989. `` Until <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> comes to terms with its own conscience, more blood is going to be spilled,'' she said, referring to killings with handguns. `` The law enforcement community is mad. They're ready to do some heavy lobbying. After the vote on the <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> bill they were irate.'' Purchasing guns, she said, `` should n't be as easy as buying bubble gum.''

 A second little girl died Thursday of wounds received in a gunman's rampage at an elementary school, and her classmates returned to school to find police guarding the grounds and teachers ready to help them through the tragedy. <PERSON> Tequila </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, 8, a third-grader at <ORGANIZATION> Oakland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, died about 12:30 p.m., never having regained consciousness since she arrived at Self Memorial Hospital after the shooting three days earlier, said hospital spokesman <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Branyon </PERSON>. Oakland Principal <PERSON> Eleanor </PERSON> <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> said the parents of the school's 600 students seem to have had most of their fears calmed since <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> opened fire Monday, reportedly focusing on children who cried In a newspaper interview published Thursday, <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said he was sorry about what happened and said he was patterning his actions in part on a Chicago-area woman's rampage in May. Pupils, many accompanied by their parents, returned to school Thursday to find the grounds edged with police officers. At least one child still wore a sling on her arm from the wound she received Monday. Mrs. <PERSON> Rice </PERSON> said staff members met with counselors Wednesday to learn how to help their pupils deal with the shootings. `` We've not had any calls suggesting students did n't want to come,'' the principal said. `` Some of our students have some fears, and we're going to work through that. `` Certainly, anything of this magnitude, it's going to take some time to recover.'' <PERSON> Leah </PERSON> <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON>, 8, her arm in a sling from a gunshot wound, shook her head emphatically and said `` Nope,'' when asked Thursday morning if she was scared to go back to school. But other children and parents arriving at the school were less sure. `` We're a little nervous, but it's just been a shock primarily,'' said <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Maxwell </PERSON>, as he walked his daughter <PERSON> Katy </PERSON> to school. <PERSON> Katy </PERSON> said she did n't hear the gunshots but remembers a teacher coming into her classroom and telling everyone to duck under their desks. Teachers took the children on tours of the building Thursday, including the cafeteria where much of the shooting took place, to satisfy the children's curiosity, schools Superintendent <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Watson </PERSON> said at a news conference. `` There were a variety of different activities in the classroom where they allowed the children to act out some of their feelings,'' <PERSON> Watson </PERSON> said. `` Several teachers felt they saw a lot of anger ... a lot of getting feelings out about the killer,'' he said. `` Our absentee rate today was a little bit above normal,'' he said. Forty-three children were out, including those who were sick, he said. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON>, 19, of <PERSON> Greenwood </PERSON> is being held on two murder charges and undergoing psychological testing at the <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hospital </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>. Police and witnesses said he walked calmly through the school Monday morning, shooting two teachers and nine pupils before surrendering. Relatives have described him as a hyperactive recluse who has been in and out of a psychiatric ward during the past eight months. Self Memorial Hospital spokesman <PERSON> Branyon </PERSON> said <PERSON> Tequila </PERSON> had been wounded in the neck and chest, and her condition had continued to deteriorate. She died Thursday with her family at her side. The other victim, <PERSON> Shequila </PERSON> <PERSON> Bradley </PERSON>, 8, died at the school Monday. Two teachers remained hospitalized in good condition Thursday and one of the students treated and released Monday was readmitted to the hospital, listed in fair condition. <PERSON> Lashonda </PERSON> <PERSON> Burt </PERSON>, 8, was hospitalized again because she was complaining of discomfort from her wounds, <PERSON> Branyon </PERSON> said. The State newspaper reported Thursday that <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said that during the shooting he was thinking about other crimes he had read about, and the teasing he received while in school for being overweight and dressing funny. `` I thought some of the students in the school were after me. I was trying to make them be quiet. I feel real bad about what happened,'' <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> told the newspaper. He said he had stayed up all night before the shootings, reading a book about <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Wayne </PERSON> <PERSON> Gacy </PERSON>, who is on <LOCATION> Illinois </LOCATION>' death row for killing 33 men and boys. <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> said `` it's possible'' the book was a factor in the shootings. The newspaper said he also mentioned a magazine article about <PERSON> Laurie </PERSON> <PERSON> Dann </PERSON>, the 30-year-old baby sitter who shot six children in a Chicago-area elementary school in May before killing herself. An 8-year-old boy died. `` I could understand where she was coming from. I think I may have copied her in a way,'' <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> told the newspaper.

 After 32 months and long, agonizing minutes Thursday, the sight of the shuttle Discovery reaching for space did n't bring a cheer from flight controllers at Mission Control. They stared at their screens intently and held back. No applause when Discovery passed 73 seconds into flight. None until they were sure it was going to be OK. Two minutes and 4 seconds into flight, when Discovery separated from the solid rocket boosters, those at the controls here broke into applause It was the boosters that caused the Challenger explosion 73 seconds into flight. Throughout the countdown and launch, <ORGANIZATION> Mission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> was calm, yet tense. Red and white carnations adorned the desk of the flight director, <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Coen </PERSON>, a good-luck gift from the security division of the Johnson Space Center. At 10:10 a.m. CDT, <PERSON> Coen </PERSON> polled the room to see if conditions were set to go. The decision to go brought a thumbs-up sign of encouragement from two <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> veterans, <PERSON> Tommy </PERSON> <PERSON> Holloway </PERSON>, manager of mission operations, and <PERSON> Eugene </PERSON> <PERSON> Kranz </PERSON>, director of mission operations and the team director during the Apollo 13 crisis. `` I felt like that as the spacecraft was going into orbit, the mood was staying down to business. I do n't think there were too many people that were reflecting or being moody for that first 8 minutes and 40 seconds,'' <PERSON> Coen </PERSON> said later during a press briefing Thursday afternoon. `` I'm sure that there were a lot of people, me included, that were very happy post-MECO _ after the engines shut down _ that we were back in the space business,'' <PERSON> Coen </PERSON> added. Visitors in a viewing room were seen biting nails and clenching fists as liftoff neared. <PERSON> Jay </PERSON> <PERSON> Green </PERSON>, chief of <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s safety program and flight director for Challenger, stood in the back of the room, hands on a bannister, staring down. The room was quiet when Discovery lifted off, except for cheers from the spectators. After the controllers' applause for the solid rocket booster separation, <ORGANIZATION> Mission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> fell quiet again until the main engines cut off. Then more cheers. `` We're going into space,'' said public information officer <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Carr </PERSON>.

 The chairman of a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> panel that oversees the <ORGANIZATION> Internal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Revenue </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> accused the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday of failing to pursue big-time operators who deal in cash and do n't file tax returns Sen. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Pryor </PERSON>, D-Ark., cited a June 1986 <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> internal audit which concluded that the agency needs to do a better job of enforcing a law requiring the reporting of cash transactions over $ 10,000 The audit found that in many cases, banks file the cash reports as required, only to have the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> ignore them. `` This is an outrage,'' <PERSON> Pryor </PERSON> said in a <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> speech. `` These people are walking into our financial institutions with wheelbarrows and suitcases full of cash money, and the banks are telling the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> who and where they are. ... The <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> has their addresses, and yet no one from this administration so much as knocked on their door.'' <PERSON> Pryor </PERSON> was responding to speech Wednesday in which Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> accused Democratic rival <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> of advocating the unleashing of an army of new <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> agents to collect enough money to balance the budget. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is calling for more <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> personnel to reduce the estimated $ 85 billion annual gap between taxes owed and paid. Instead of criticizing <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' proposals, <PERSON> Pryor </PERSON> said, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> should be explaining why the administration has failed to pursue the big spenders identified by the reports. <PERSON> Pryor </PERSON>, who chairs the Finance subcommittee on the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION>, released portions of an <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> analysis of a sampling of cash-transaction reports filed with the agency. `` Current systems do not assure that taxpayers with significant currency transactions are considered for examination -LRB- audit -RRB- or that currency activity is evaluated during examinations,'' the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> document read. Of 924 individuals identified as having made large cash transactions, only 680 filed tax returns, the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> concluded. `` Only 211 of the 680 tax returns were examined or classified. The average currency activity by the 211 taxpayers was $ 228,000. We reviewed 67 of the 211 cases. In 61 instances, CTR -LRB- currency transaction report -RRB- information was not considered in determining the correct tax liability,'' the <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> found. Of the 244 cases in which tax returns wer not filed, investigations of a tax delinquency were begun in only 47. `` No action was taken for the remaining 197 individuals,'' the report stated. `` These 197 individuals had currency activity for 1982 averaging $ 183,000 each.'' `` We spend millions of dollars each year to collect this information, yet this administration has failed to use it,'' <PERSON> Pryor </PERSON> said. `` The report is two years old, based on data from 1982,'' <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Wilson </PERSON> <PERSON> Fadely </PERSON> said. `` The <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> has taken a number of actions since then.'' For example, <PERSON> Fadely </PERSON> said, data on cash-transaction reports are now provided to district offices for use by collection personnel. Auditors soon will be implementing a system that gives auditors in district offices computer access to information on cash reports while an examination is under way.

 A father and son accused of trying to smuggle spare missile parts to their native <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION> blamed each other in opening arguments in their federal trial here Thursday. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Customs agents arrested <PERSON> Ahmad </PERSON> and <PERSON> Majid </PERSON> <PERSON> Modarressi </PERSON> in January at a suburban <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> railyard where they allegedly had come to buy $ 280,000 worth of electronic tubes for Hawk anti-aircraft missiles. An attorney for the father, <PERSON> Ahmad </PERSON> <PERSON> Modarressi </PERSON>, 64, of <LOCATION> Tehran </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Istanbul </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Turkey </LOCATION>, told the jury that <PERSON> Majid </PERSON>, 30, arranged the deal and never told his father it was illegal. But an attorney for the son, who lives in <LOCATION> Cincinnati </LOCATION> with his American wife, maintained that he acted only as a translator for his father and was `` a very naive person'' who did not understand what the elder <PERSON> Modarressi </PERSON> was trying to buy and ship to <LOCATION> Iran </LOCATION>. Defense attorneys said after the court session that they hoped the jury would clear both men. `` I guess the best possible outcome would be if they found <PERSON> Majid </PERSON> was just an airhead and -LRB- the elder -RRB- <PERSON> Modarressi </PERSON> did n't know it was illegal,'' said <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>, attorney for the father. The defense attorneys had asked for separate trials but the motion was denied by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolf </PERSON>. The prosecutor, Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Sterns </PERSON>, said the Modarressis were arrested after a four-month investigation in which a customs agent had posed as an official of the <ORGANIZATION> Raytheon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Lexington </LOCATION>, maker of the Hawk missile parts. The agent, <PERSON> Steve </PERSON> <PERSON> Crogan </PERSON>, recorded more than a dozen conversations with the Modarressis in which they talked about buying up to $ 60 million of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> weapons but eventually settled on the four electronic tubes worth $ 280,000 <PERSON> Sterns </PERSON> said. The <PERSON> Modarressis </PERSON> entered the courtroom together, left together and sat together during the opening arguments. If convicted of conspiring to violate the Arms Export Control Act, each could face up to 15 years in prison, a $ 1.25 million fine and deportation. <PERSON> Sterns </PERSON> said the electronic Klystron and Twystron tubes, each of which is about 4 feet long and 6 inches in diameter, are used in a mobile radar that is integral to the Hawk system, a missile the Iranians could use to shoot down aircraft. <PERSON> Owen </PERSON> <PERSON> Walker </PERSON>, the federal public defender representing <PERSON> Majid </PERSON> <PERSON> Modarressi </PERSON>, said `` these kind of tubes are used in practically ... every radar system, every TV station, every radio station. There's nothing uniquely or inherently military about them. <PERSON> Walker </PERSON> said the younger <PERSON> Modarressi </PERSON> came to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> in 1976 to study architectural drafting, married his wife, <PERSON> Alicia </PERSON>, in 1982 and settled in <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, where he works as an architectural consultant. The elder <PERSON> Modarressi </PERSON> was described by defense attorneys as an international merchant who has dealt in shoes and pistachios and had briefly discussed becoming <ORGANIZATION> Raytheon </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> sales representative in 1984.

<TEXT>
 The shuttle's booster rockets, redesigned and tested again and again after Challenger, passed the test that counted Thursday when they powered Discovery successfully toward orbit. `` From everything I see, everything looks great,'' said <PERSON> J.R. </PERSON> <PERSON> Thompson </PERSON>, who directed the booster overhaul project from the <ORGANIZATION> Marshall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flight </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Alabama </LOCATION>. He awaited, along with other <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> officials, data that would provide a detailed analysis of the booster performance. Some people watching the launch on television were alarmed to see what looked like flame spewing from the side of one rocket after liftoff, as if in awful imitation of the Challenger disaster. But experts attributed it to a trick of physics that had been observed during other normal launches. The 149-foot-long reusable rockets peeled off from the shuttle right on schedule after their fuel was burned out at 2 minutes, 4 seconds into flight. The spent casings dropped into the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION>, their fall slowed by parachutes, and were quickly recovered by the ships <ORGANIZATION> Liberty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Star </ORGANIZATION> and Freedom Star 150 miles off the <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> coast. <PERSON> Stuart </PERSON> <PERSON> Shadbolt </PERSON>, a spokesman for <ORGANIZATION> Lockheed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Operations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which is in charge of the recovery, said the boosters were expected to reach <LOCATION> Port </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canaveral </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, under tow by Friday night. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> said crews who inspected the boosters in the water reported they appeared to be in good shape. Kennedy Space Center spokesman <PERSON> Dick </PERSON> <PERSON> Young </PERSON> said early data showed `` no anomalies.'' The rockets will get a far more intense scrutiny once they are towed to shore and before they are refitted by manufacturer <ORGANIZATION> Morton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Thiokol </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> for use on a future flight. It was a failure of the booster rockets that caused the explosion of Challenger and the death of its seven crew members 73 seconds after launch on Jan. 28, 1986. The <ORGANIZATION> Rogers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, which investigated the destruction of Challenger, blamed that disaster on an O-ring that failed to seal in cold-weather conditions, allowing flame to escape and ignite a fuel tank. Rather than delay resumption of shuttle flights until it could develop an entirely new booster, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> spent $ 800 million to make 145 changes in the design and then conducted a series of demanding tests. Experts said the results of all the changes are rockets just short of the best design possible. `` If you started with a clean sheet of paper, there are things you could do'' to improve the rockets, said <PERSON> Russ </PERSON> <PERSON> Bardos </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s director of shuttle propulsion When fully loaded with 1.1 million pounds of propellant, each booster weighs 1.3 million pounds and produces 3.3 million pounds of thrust. Two are used for each shuttle launch, providing 80 percent of the power needed to lift the winged spacecraft from the pad toward orbit. Because the rockets are so massive, they are manufactured in four segments. Each segment is joined at a seam called a field joint. The parts are assembled at the Kennedy Space Center. The joints used for 25 shuttle flights had a metal rim, called a tang, that fit into a deep metal groove called a clevis. On one side of the clevis were two O-ring seals made of a rubberized material. The clevis and tang were held together by bolts. Experience showed that when the rocket booster fired, generating about 900 pounds of internal pressure, the thick steel booster casing ballooned slightly, an action called `` rotation.'' This caused the clevis and tang to separate slightly, preventing the O-rings from sealing. The O-rings also are less likely to seal if the rubberized material is made hard by cold temperatures. Challenger was launched after soaking in freezing temperatures overnight. The rotation problem was corrected by a new joint that added a metal lip, called a capture feature, to the tang. This joint resembles a handshake, with the new `` thumb'' on the tang giving extra strength. The redesign team also added a third O-ring and installed heaters to keep the joint a constant 75 degrees. Inside the rocket, insulation was redesigned to include a J-shaped slit. Under pressure, the slit causes insulation to shift, forming still another seal. Engineers also realized that a nozzle-to-case joint on the booster was even more flawed than the case joint. To correct this problem, the redesign team added 100 bolts for added strength, an additional O-ring seal, and put a slit-seal in the insulation. As to the appearance of flame from the side of the rocket during Thursday's launch, <PERSON> Royce </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON>, Solid Rocket manager at <LOCATION> Marshall </LOCATION>, said it was due to the physical law of `` reverse flow separation.'' <PERSON> Mitchell </PERSON> said that as the shuttle begins to roll, the booster plumes _ the flame that comes from the bottom of the rockets in normal operation _ sometimes converge and the hot particles recirculate. He compared the visual effect to seeing a man on a speeding motorcycle. Instead of his jacket flapping out behind, it is plastered to his back because of the reverse separation principle.

 A Miami-bound <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> jet with 130 people aboard slid off the runway while taxiing for takeoff Thursday, breaking the landing gear, starting an engine fire and injuring nine people, officials said. The <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 727 was quickly evacuated and firefighters soon extinguished the blaze in the left engine, said a control tower official. The plane, carrying 122 passengers and eight crew members, apparently had problems with its landing gear shortly before the accident, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. None of the Americans aboard was injured. `` The plane had started taxiing, then we realized it was bumping along the runway. It left the tarmac, dropped its nose and ended up crosswise on the runway,'' the tower official said. The jet came to a stop after the front landing gear snapped and the nose plowed into the ground just off the runway, he said. The engine fire apparently began when the engine scraped the runway after the landing gear broke. Civil aviation and <ORGANIZATION> Eastern </ORGANIZATION> officials refused to comment. The control tower official said most of the passengers were Costa Rican. An official at the <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> said all nine injured were Costa Rican and they were treated and released. The official refused to be identified. All flights in and out of <LOCATION> Juan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Santamaria </LOCATION> <LOCATION> International </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Airport </LOCATION> were suspended after the 8:40 a.m. -LRB- 10:40 a.m. EDT -RRB- accident.

<HEAD>Pentagon Weapons Tester Says Aegis System Adequately Tested</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The Aegis electronic system was adequately tested before the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> began buying the sophisticated ship defense, the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> chief weapons tester told <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday. The report by <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Krings </PERSON> disputed a study by the <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION>, which had raised questions about the adequacy of tests of the Aegis system. `` The operational testing of Aegis has been adequate to support the acquisition decisions that have been made and more testing will be conducted to support future decisions,'' <PERSON> Krings </PERSON>, director of the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s new operational test and evaluation program, told a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee. It was an Aegis-class cruiser, the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION>, which shot down an Iranian commercial airliner in the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> on July 3 in the mistaken belief that the plane was an Iranian military jet. All 290 persons aboard the jetliner were killed. Questions were raised in the wake of the incident about Aegis, which the <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> has touted as the world's most sophisticated air defense system. But a <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> investigation into the shootdown exonerated the Aegis system, concluding that it worked as designed. The probe concluded that human error led to the mistakes and said <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> officers on the <LOCATION> Vincennes </LOCATION> misread data. <PERSON> Krings </PERSON>' office was created by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> five years ago in the wake of reports that weapons had performed poorly because they had n't been realistically tested before they were purchased by the Pentagon. The <ORGANIZATION> Navy </ORGANIZATION> is relying heavily on the Aegis system to protect its surface fleet, putting it aboard a new class of destroyers along with the Aegis-class cruisers. The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> criticized the Aegis tests, but that criticism was contained as part of a larger <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> study which pointed out what the congressional watchdog agency said were shortcomings in the operation of <PERSON> Krings </PERSON>' office. The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said atmospheric ducting occurred in April 1984 during Aegis testing. Ducting could have unfairly biased the reports of some of the tests, according to <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Krings </PERSON> disputed the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION>'s complaints about the testing of the Aegis system. `` Ducting is a natural phenomenom prevalent in many areas of the world, including the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Persian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION>,'' he told the <ORGANIZATION> Armed </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> seapower subcommittee. `` The operational tester has no control over whether or not ducting will be present during a test,'' he said. `` To run operational tests with a stipulation that they not be run when ducting occurs would be as unrealistic as a stipulation that tests only be run when ducting is present.''

In the letter, <PERSON> Seymour </PERSON> wrote that `` following last December's guilty verdict in the <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Deaver </PERSON> case, I was asked to speak to college and law school audiences about <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> ethics. `` I hope to schedule more campus visits this coming year, and I am writing to enlist your help.'' `` As a result of my indoctrination in the ways of <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> as independent counsel in the <PERSON> Deaver </PERSON> case, I have developed quite strong views on how to achieve a higher standards of ethics in government,'' <PERSON> Seymour </PERSON> wrote under the letterhead of his <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> law office. <PERSON> Seymour </PERSON> refused to comment about the letter to The <ORGANIZATION> Associated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Press </ORGANIZATION>. But in an interview published in Thursday's editions of <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Times </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Seymour </PERSON> defended the speaking engagements, saying his fee of $ 2,500 to $ 5,000 per appearance was `` way below market.'' `` Look at it this way,'' <PERSON> Seymour </PERSON> told the Times. `` This is a way to try to get a message out to the future leaders of this country that they ought to be doing something about improving the level of ethics in the nation's capital.'' `` The ideal arrangement for visiting a campus is to be invited to appear as a paid speaker at a scheduled student evening program,'' wrote <PERSON> Seymour </PERSON>, who told the Times he had sent the letter to `` several dozen'' colleges in July. <PERSON> Seymour </PERSON>'s solicitation also was criticized as `` maladroit'' but not unethical by <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Hazard </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Yale </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> professor who specializes in legal ethics. `` It's just kind of tacky'' to solicit speaking engagements, Hazard said. `` If it's fitting that he give speeches at colleges, he ought to let them think of the idea.'' <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Gillers </PERSON>, a legal ethics expert who teaches at <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, said he would not have solicited the speaking engagements before <PERSON> Deaver </PERSON>'s sentencing to avoid any misperception of impropriety. `` I have no problem with his decision to try to become a spokesman on government ethics and to charge for it,'' <PERSON> Gillers </PERSON> said. The only issue is whether to wait until after <PERSON> Deaver </PERSON> is sentenced to avoid any appearance of trying to cash in on the case, <PERSON> Gillers </PERSON> said. `` In my view it was a question of judgment. <PERSON> Seymour </PERSON> could reasonably have concluded that a July announcement would not reasonably create an appearance of impropriety.'' <PERSON> Seymour </PERSON> drew criticism last year when he delivered an emotional attack on what he termed the low state of government ethics in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. The speech was delivered on the steps of the <LOCATION> U.S </LOCATION>. Courthouse a day after <PERSON> Deaver </PERSON> was convicted of three counts of lying to a grand jury and a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee that investigated his lobbying activities. <PERSON> Deaver </PERSON>, former deputy White House chief of staff and a longtime friend of President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, last week received a suspended three-year sentence and a $ 100,000 fine. He also was ordered to perform 1,500 hours of community service during the three years he was placed on probation. <PERSON> Seymour </PERSON> had sough imprisonment for <PERSON> Deaver </PERSON>, saying such a sentence would `` have a deterrent effect on the ethics and conduct of political insiders.'' In pronouncing sentence, <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Penfield </PERSON> <PERSON> Jackson </PERSON> rejected this argument, saying <PERSON> Deaver </PERSON> was not found guilty of illegal lobbying. But the judge barred <PERSON> Deaver </PERSON> from lobbying the federal government for profit for three years.

<HEAD>Corn Sale to Soviets Announced</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 An additional 200,000 metric tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corn has been sold to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> for delivery during the coming year, the <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday. The sale brought total corn sold to the Soviets in the last month for delivery in the 1988-89 year that began on Sept. 1 to more than 3.98 million tons. A metric ton is about 2,205 pounds and is equal to 39.4 bushels of corn or 36.7 bushels of wheat or soybeans. The 200,000 tons of corn would be about 7.88 million bushels. Corn prices have been averaging about $ 2.61 per bushel at the farm level, according to <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> estimates, meaning that the latest sale could have a farm value of around $ 21 million. A five-year long-term grain agreement with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> expires on Sept. 30, but that will not prevent further sales to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. Negotiations have been going on for months in an effort to work out a new pact. According to the old agreement, the annual purchases were supposed to include a minimum of 4 million tons each of wheat and corn. The Soviets had the option of buying the remaining 1 million tons as wheat, corn or soybeans, with every ton of beans counting as two tons of grain _ up to a maximum of 1 million tons of grain equivalent. Prior to sales announced since Sept. 1, the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> had purchased 9.05 million tons of wheat and 5.17 million tons of corn for delivery in the fifth year and final year of the agreement, plus 830,000 tons of soybeans and 1.3 million tons of soybean meal.

The Japanese have been reacting to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> black appeals against such insensitivity `` in typical <LOCATION> Asian </LOCATION> fashion _ they have been very polite, but nothing has happened,'' Rep. <PERSON> Mervyn </PERSON> <PERSON> Dymally </PERSON>, D-Calif., chairman of the congressional black caucus, told reporters The campaign was formulated at a meeting of leading <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> black political, business and civil rights organizations earlier this month. Part of the Japanese insensitivity is racial, <PERSON> Dymally </PERSON> said, recalling critical remarks about <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> blacks by former Prime Minister <PERSON> Yasuhiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Nakasone </PERSON> and former Finance Minister <PERSON> Michio </PERSON> <PERSON> Watanabe </PERSON>, for which they later apologized. <PERSON> Watanabe </PERSON>, who told a party meeting last July that <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> blacks seem unconcerned about declaring bankruptcy, may be <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s next prime minister, the congressman said. With <PERSON> Dymally </PERSON> at a news conference were representatives of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Urban </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> League </ORGANIZATION>, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Advancement </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Colored </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Black </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, three of more than two dozen supporting organizations. Black Business Council Representative <PERSON> Kent </PERSON> <PERSON> Amos </PERSON> said the `` Buy American'' effort called for the heaviest shopping season of the year is not a boycott but an effort to divert part of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> blacks' $ 300 billion annual purchasing power to `` companies in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> responsive to our needs ...'' `` We as a black community have been through the process of sensitizing insensitive communities before,'' <PERSON> Amos </PERSON> said. `` In the 1960s and 1970s, it was corporate <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. ... We are much further along in our understanding of our economic role now, and we wo n't be as patient We are willing to assist anyone willing to listen, but not enough people are willing ... and until that happens we will continue to have confrontation.'' The campaign will include pressure to persuade Japanese-owned businesses and factories now proliferating in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> to hire more blacks at all levels, <PERSON> Dymally </PERSON> said. American vice presidents of such firms are failing to convince their Japanese bosses that `` this is <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, and we have affirmative action goals,'' he said. Japanese auto firms with the exception of <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION> have no black-owned dealerships and Japanese investors are giving no business to black real estate firms or banks, he asserted. For new factories, `` every Japanese automobile manufacturer seeks rural <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> or suburban <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>, as far as they can get from urban centers where there is a surplus of labor and where minorities live,'' <PERSON> Dymally </PERSON> charged. `` We want to be conciliatory,'' <PERSON> Dymally </PERSON> said, adding that the first objective of the campaign is a dialogue between Japanese government and corporate officials and the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> black community. But <PERSON> Dymally </PERSON> said it has been difficult to engage the Japanese side in dialogue. Racial insensitivity in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> is being fought by `` some enlightened people in the government and some corporations are taking the right steps,'' <PERSON> Amos </PERSON> said. `` If all would follow the lead of <ORGANIZATION> Sony </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- electronics -RRB- and <ORGANIZATION> Toyota </ORGANIZATION>, we would be much further along,'' he said, but did not clarify how those firms could be spared potential loss caused by a `` Buy American'' campaign. The Black Business Council seeks Japanese investment targeted at revival of decaying <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> inner cities and its president, <PERSON> Al </PERSON> <PERSON> Nellum </PERSON>, will be pursuing this in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> next week, <PERSON> Amos </PERSON> said.

 On the day <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeepers won the Nobel Peace Prize, a Soviet official on Thursday said failure to take seriously <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION>'s alleged violations of the Afghan pact could mean `` difficulties'' for future peacekeeping. <PERSON> Gennady </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON>, the spokesman of the <ORGANIZATION> Soviet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, said <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping forces in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> are `` not doing their job properly'' and should be investigated by the secretary-general if future peacekeeping forces are to be approved. The <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>, one of the five permanent members of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION>, has the power to veto new <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> peacekeeping proposals. The other permanent members are <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. The foreign ministers of the permanent members met Wednesday evening at the request of Soviet Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> to discuss Soviet claims that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> are violating the U.N.-mediated Afghan accords signed in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> on April 14. Those accords call for the Soviets to withdraw more than 100,000 <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> troops from <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, and for <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> to respect each other's territorial integrity. `` If we do not succeed in creating an efficient control mechanism here in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>, which is kind of a testing ground, then we will have difficulties in creating this kind of mechanism in other conflicts,'' said <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON>. The `` mechanism'' he referred to is the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> military observer group monitoring the Soviet withdrawal and alleged violations of the accords. On Tuesday, <PERSON> Shevardnaze </PERSON> said the Soviets had finished the first part of their troop withdrawal, but had not yet begun the second phase, and said it depended on whether the violations of the accord cease. When asked Thursday if the Soviets were slowing their retreat, <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> said: `` We do n't want to be too specific, but we are worried. ... These violations must be stopped.'' <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> observers determined that half the Soviet troops had withdrawn by Aug. 15, so <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON>'s statement meant the <ORGANIZATION> Red </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION> retreat has stopped for the last six weeks. The withdrawal began May 15 and is to be complete by next Feb. 15. <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> said <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> armed the Afghan guerrillas and was allowing at least two training camps to operate on its territory for about 3,400 fighters. He said 2,500 Afghan fighters were in training near <LOCATION> Islamabad </LOCATION>, the Pakistani capital, and 900 others at a base near the Afghan border with the assistance of Chinese, American and Pakistani advisers. The Soviet spokesman also accused Pakistani authorities of patroling refugee camps to stop Afghans from returning to their homeland. The spokesman called for a detailed report from the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION>, which has stationed observers in <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION>. At the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> session Wednesday night, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said Soviet and Afghan pilots violated <LOCATION> Pakistani </LOCATION> territory with bombing raids. <PERSON> Gerasimov </PERSON> acknowledged that a Soviet pilot was downed in <LOCATION> Pakistan </LOCATION> a few weeks ago. He thanked the Pakistani government for returning him. Otherwise, the Soviet official said, `` there is no intrusion, and we are saying it all the time. It is really not true.'' Soviet troops entered <LOCATION> Afghanistan </LOCATION> in December 1979 to back a Marxist government. They stayed on to help the government fight a Moslem insurgency.

<HEAD>Reagan Signs Bill To Upgrade U.S. Spy Capability</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By SUSANNE M. SCHAFER</BYLINE>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, saying secrecy is essential for the nation's security, signed legislation Thursday designed to help modernize <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s outmoded spy satellite network. In a statement announcing he had signed the bill, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> predicted the measure `` will strengthen <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> intelligence capabilities.'' The spy satellite modernization program was initiated by the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intelligence </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> after it concluded that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> photo and eavesdropping satellites were becoming outdated. The nation's spy network in outer space had not been substantially updated in a decade The precise provisions and funding levels of the bill are classified, but <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said the legislation authorizes the appropriations `` at approximately the level I requested.'' Total spending on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> intelligence programs reportedly amounts to about $ 25 billion. Nearly all of the money is hidden away in the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION>'s budget. `` As the <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has recognized, secrecy is essential to success in the intelligence activities upon which the nation's security depends,'' the president's statement said The <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> panel called for the modernization of the spy network after reviewing verification capabilities for the new arms control treaty with the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> on medium-range nuclear weapons. The lawmakers found that <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> monitoring technology would be inadequate if the superpowers later reached agreement on deep cuts in long-range nuclear weapons. Even though <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> signed the bill into law, he cited `` constitutional concerns'' about two separate sections of the legislation. One provision of the bill included language that prohibits the government from aiding <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s Contra rebels unless specifically authorized by <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. The issue arose during the Iran-Contra arms and money scandal when the administration insisted that prohibitions on intelligence agencies aiding the rebels did not extend to the president's <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> staff. The new legislation bars any `` entity'' of the government from unauthorized aid to the Contra rebels, which would include the <ORGANIZATION> NSC </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said he signed the measure with the understanding that the extension of the restriction `` is not intended to, and does not, apply in a manner and to an extent that would conflict with my constitutional authority and duty to conduct the foreign relations of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> also said he was concerned about another requirement he contended would `` conflict with the constitutional protection afforded the integrity and confidentiality'' of internal deliberations of the executive branch. The provision requires that the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> report to <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> about the activities of the agency's internal inspector general, who investigates allegations of wrongdoing. The provision would require the <ORGANIZATION> CIA </ORGANIZATION> director to tell congressional overseers any time he bars the inspector general from undertaking a specific investigation.

 Protesters used tear gas and stench bombs at movie theaters in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> and several provincial cities Wednesday to disrupt the French debut of `` The Last Temptation of Christ.'' About 600 protesters at a demonstration called by followers of excommunicated Archbishop <PERSON> Marcel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lefebvre </PERSON>, a traditionalist Roman Catholic, clashed with police in front of a Left Bank movie house on the <LOCATION> Boulevard </LOCATION> <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germain </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. One police officer was reported injured. In <LOCATION> Marseille </LOCATION>, police said demonstrators were led by two traditionalist priests carrying banners protesting the showing of film director <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Scorsese </PERSON>'s adaptation of the novel by <PERSON> Nikos </PERSON> <PERSON> Kazantzakis </PERSON>. Showings were disrupted in three cinemas in <LOCATION> Marseille </LOCATION>, one in Angers, and one in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> by tear gas and stench bombs set off by the protesters. Customers were reimbursed for the price of the tickets. Many other movie houses showed the film without incident, but in <LOCATION> Avignon </LOCATION> four people rose shouting from their seats an hour into the film, barged into the projection room and ripped up the theater's copy of the film In <LOCATION> Rennes </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Poitier </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Laval </ORGANIZATION>, Roman Catholic groups protested peacefully. Two other demonstrations against the film took place Wednesday on the <ORGANIZATION> Right </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> the </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Seine </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. Cardinal <PERSON> Jean-Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Lustiger </PERSON>, the Roman Catholic archbishop of <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, issued a protest against the movie, but said he did not support banning its showing and would not request or participate in any public demonstrations. The <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Appeals </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> refused on Tuesday to order a nationwide ban on showings of the film, which includes scenes in which <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> imagines being intimate with <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Magdalene </PERSON>. The appeals court also overturned a lower court order last week saying a disclaimer must be projected on the screen and read aloud at every showing. However, the court did order that all advertising for the film specify that it is not an adaptation of the biblical account, but of the <PERSON> Kazantzakis </PERSON> novel. In <LOCATION> Aix-en-Provence </LOCATION>, municipal officials banned showing the film.

<HEAD>Vatican Blames Catholic Community for Seminaries' Student Shortage</HEAD>

<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> Vatican </LOCATION> said Thursday that some of the 37 <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> seminaries in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> are `` starved of students'' because they are not getting adequate support from the <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> community. A Vatican commission, after a seven-year investigation and visits to the college-level seminaries, praised the quality of education offered to prospective priests but said the institutions `` are not receiving the support which they both need and deserve'' from the Catholic population at large and from <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s bishops. Several American <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> seminaries have closed in recent years. The commission especially deplored the tendency of dioceses to send priesthood candidates to small, local schools, known as Houses of Formation, which do not have as high academic standards as traditional seminaries. Students at the Houses of Formation receive theological training but must attend secular colleges for their academic work. The practice submits students `` to a philosophical formation which is inadequate to the needs of the priesthood,'' Cardinal <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Baum </PERSON> reported in a letter read and approved by <PERSON> Pope </PERSON> <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> II and sent to every Catholic bishop in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Baum </PERSON> heads the <ORGANIZATION> Vatican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Congregation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION>, which was directed in 1981 to investigate the quality of education offered candidates for the priesthood in <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>. `` We would urge all bishops who maintain Houses of Formation of this kind to transfer their students to proper college seminaries and to commit their resources, especially personnel, to these seminaries,'' the cardinal said. `` Such slogans as small-is-beautiful, local-is-best are disguising a situation in which college level candidates for the priesthood are being deprived of the quality of priestly formation which they merit and which the church needs,'' he added. `` The college seminaries survive because of the heroic sacrifice and commitment of the bishops and religious orders who own and operate them, but many dioceses do not send their priesthood candidates to proper college seminaries with the result that good as their formation programs may be many college seminaries are being starved of students,'' <PERSON> Baum </PERSON> wrote. The commission also said that because of the dropoff in the number of students, `` some seminaries are tempt to lower their standards and admit students about whom they harbor reservations.'' Generally, graduates of the seminaries attend theologates, for a final level of training, before becoming priests. On another matter, <PERSON> Baum </PERSON> said seminaries must do job of teaching future priests the `` theological rationale of celibacy ... based on the example of Our Lord Himself.'' He said there was too much emphasis currently on the mere discipline of celibacy without attention to its theological basis. <PERSON> Baum </PERSON>'s letter took note of the dropoff in the number of priesthood candidate and listed reasons for it: `` pressures on the family, the attraction of material prosperity and social comfort, the sexual revolution and the growth of insecurity, as well as a delay in the age of personal career decisions-making.''

 The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and 11 allied countries signed an agreement Thursday to build a $ 23 billion permanently manned space station designed to serve as a stepping-stone for human exploration of the solar system. The facility, known as Space Station Freedom, will be designed, developed, operated and used by all of the partners, which include nine <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> allies, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>, in addition to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is providing $ 16 billion to the program and the other partners are contributing more than $ 7 billion. The agreement was formalized at a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> signing ceremony at which Secretary of State <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> presided. Officials said it was a coincidence that the agreement was signed on the same day that the Discovery space shuttle was launched at <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canaveral </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> scientist, told reporters the project is `` clearly the world's largest ever international venture and certainly one of the most complex. <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Finarelli </PERSON>, an official of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aeronautics </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION>, said the Europeans countries, all members of the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, will contribute $ 4.2 billion to the project, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> $ 2 billion and <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> $ 1 billion. At the signing ceremony, <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said the station will be used `` to test equipment and techniques for long space voyages and the development of new materials of great benefit to mankind. `` For the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, Space Station Freedom will be the centerpience of our civil space program for the 1990s. It is an essential next step if the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> is to stay on the cutting edge of space exploration and research,'' <PERSON> Shultz </PERSON> said. Earlier, <PERSON> Heinz </PERSON> <PERSON> Riesenhuber </PERSON>, the West German chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> European </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION>, emphasized that the project will be used only for peaceful purposes. `` Together we can reach for goals that are beyond the reach of each one of us if he tries to go it alone,'' <PERSON> Riesenhuber </PERSON> said. Twenty-two shuttle flights over a period of three years will be required to place in <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> orbit all the hardware for the station. Construction will be completed in the first quarter of 1998 although the facility will be permanently inhabited from late 1996 on, according to current plans. A <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> summary of the program said a manned space station is needed to lay the groundwork for a colony on the moon or a manned mission to <LOCATION> Mars </LOCATION>. `` It will provide a focal point for free world space operations well into the next century and will serve as a stepping-stone for human exploration of the solar system,'' the summary said. The station will be used to study the effects of prolonged weightlessness on humans and to create a life support system for long space voyages. `` Because it is being designed to evolve and grow, this station can become the facility which will serve as a point of assembly, test and departure for future manned missions to the moon or to Mars,'' the statement said. The project will comprise a combination of permanentlty manned, man-tended and unmanned elements. According to the current schedule, the facility will be ready for permanent habitation in late 1996. The basic structure of the manned base, including the power system and the habitation module, will be provided by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> will provide the hardware for use in station assembly, maintenance and servicing. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and the European countries will construct pressurized laboratories, allowing astronauts to do research in a shirt sleeves environment. In addition to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, the other participants are <LOCATION> Belgium </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Denmark </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, the <LOCATION> Netherlands </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Lithuanian Activists Rally to Protest Police Beatings</HEAD>
<DATELINE>MOSCOW (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Thousands of Lithuanians rallied in their capital Thursday to protest beatings by police who broke up two nationalist demonstrations and arrested at least 100 people, a dissident said. Neither the official <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> news agency or Radio <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>'s international service on Thursday mentioned the reported disturbances on the main square of <LOCATION> Vilnius </LOCATION> <PERSON> Valdas </PERSON> <PERSON> Analauskas </PERSON>, a correspondent with the dissident journal Express-Chronicle, said a prosecutor refused to file charges against those arrested during a demonstration Wednesday and an overnight hunger strike on Gediminas Square. Most of those arrested were released Thursday, but a large crowd gathered around the courthouse where the remaining 20 people were to be tried in a closed court session, Analauskas reported. Instead, the 20 were released. At least 5,000 people gathered on the square Thursday night, carrying the flag of the independent Lithuanian republic and banners reading `` Shame on the police,'' he said. A lunch-time gathering also drew thousands, he reported. Nine Lithuanian activists declared a hunger strike Wednesday night and remained on the square all night after police broke up a protest earlier that day with armored personnel carriers and rubber truncheons, <PERSON> Analauskas </PERSON> said. About 20 sympathizers had gathered around the hunger strikers, and dozens of police waded into the crowd, beating, kicking and pulling hair, <PERSON> Analauskas </PERSON> said. The demonstrators were forced into two buses and driven away, he said. Analauskas estimated that up to 30 people were taken into custody Thursday morning following earlier arrests. The initial protest Wednesday was against Soviet control of <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>, one of three Baltic republics absorbed by the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> in 1940. <LOCATION> Lithuania </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Latvia </LOCATION>, and <LOCATION> Estonia </LOCATION> had been independent countries from shortly after the 1917 Bolshevik Revolution until 1940. On Aug. 23, thousands of people gathered in the three republics to protest the 1939 non-aggression pact between the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Nazi </ORGANIZATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> that divided <LOCATION> Eastern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> into spheres of influence and led to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> takeover of the <ORGANIZATION> Baltics </ORGANIZATION>. Baltic activists are seeking more economic and political freedom. Some are demanding outright independence from the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Analauskas </PERSON> said some protesters threw stones at police Wednesday night.

 <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s re-entry to space on Thursday prompted more sighs of relief than cheers in <PERSON> Christa </PERSON> <PERSON> McAuliffe </PERSON>'s hometown, where residents hope Discovery will help heal horrible memories of the Challenger explosion `` This puts -LRB- the bad memories of -RRB- <PERSON> Christa </PERSON> <PERSON> McAuliffe </PERSON> behind us,'' said <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Sargent </PERSON>, 20, a former student of the <ORGANIZATION> Concord </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> teacher whose death on Challenger 32 months ago plunged the city into grief that still lingers. `` I think she'd have wanted it this way.'' <PERSON> Sargent </PERSON> watched the launch at <ORGANIZATION> Sears </ORGANIZATION> on Main Street, where about 15 people gathered in front of a wall of television sets. `` I was standing here in the same spot when it blew up,'' he said. `` It's about time they improved it. It looks like they're doing things right this time. <PERSON> Sargent </PERSON> said that as a student, he sat next to <PERSON> McAuliffe </PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION> Concord </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION> the day before she left for <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canaveral </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> McLaughlin </PERSON>, who listened to a radio broadcast of the Discovery launch at <PERSON> Haggett </PERSON>'s Bike Shop, said: `` It brought a lump to my throat, especially when they talked about just getting past the point of the explosion of the last one.'' <PERSON> McLaughlin </PERSON>, who outfitted <PERSON> McAuliffe </PERSON>'s family with bicycles, said the Discovery blastoff `` brought back some sad memories. `` I do n't think that being in <LOCATION> Concord </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hampshire </LOCATION>, we'll ever forget about the shuttle. Every time there's news about the shuttle, there will be apprehension.'' But he added that each successful launch `` will make the pain a little less.'' <PERSON> Betsey </PERSON> <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON>, who watched the Challenger explosion from the grandstand at <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canaveral </LOCATION>, said tears came to her eyes as she watched Discovery on television at home. `` I did n't realize how emotional this would be,'' she said. `` It's really very exciting to see a success _ and such a big relief.'' <PERSON> Rogers </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> in 1986 as a chaperone for a third-grade class from <LOCATION> Concord </LOCATION>, which included <PERSON> McAuliffe </PERSON>'s son, <PERSON> Scott </PERSON>. She and others hope the successful Discovery launch will help erase Challenger memories. `` The biggest thing that is going to help is that that -LRB- Challenger -RRB- is in the past and now everyone is going to move into the future,'' said <PERSON> Clint </PERSON> <PERSON> Cogswell </PERSON>, principal of the <ORGANIZATION> Kimball </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, which the two <PERSON> McAuliffe </PERSON> children attend. `` We'll just be left alone, which is just the way it should be. We're no longer a story.'' <PERSON> Cogswell </PERSON> said no classes at his school watched the launch, and that he and his staff still feel a duty to shield the <PERSON> McAuliffe </PERSON> youngsters from shuttle exposure. He said both children were in school Thursday and school officials kept reporters and photographers away. Police officers kept the media away from <ORGANIZATION> Concord </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> High </ORGANIZATION>. There were no assemblies, though two or three classes watched the launch on television. A hand-made sign in a second-floor window proclaimed: `` Godspeed Discovery Crew.''

 Wind-driven flames crackled through 6,700 acres of brush Thursday and roared past homes abandoned by residents facing <LOCATION> Southern </LOCATION> <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>'s first major blaze of the dreaded fall fire season. Desert-dry <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ana </LOCATION> winds blasted through canyons of the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Gabriel </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mountains </LOCATION> at up to 60 mph, pushing flames toward an 1,800-home section in the <LOCATION> Etiwanda </LOCATION> district, and by mid-morning the fire reached a schoolyard. About 150 people fled with belongings they could carry, but by noon the winds had dropped to less than 5 mph and 10 aircraft were able to bombard trouble spots. `` No structures are now threatened,'' said Capt. <PERSON> Erny </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Keefe </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> California </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Forestry </ORGANIZATION>. None of the $ 150,000 homes was damaged when the fire swept by, `` just a few dilapidated chicken coops,'' she said. The evacuation recommendation was withdrawn by midday. At dawn, hose-toting homeowners squirted water on rooftops while others corraled their children, pets and personal possessions and headed for evacuation centers. But many refused to leave. `` They want to be sure it is really coming,'' <ORGANIZATION> Rancho </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cucamonga </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> City </ORGANIZATION> Manager <PERSON> Lauren </PERSON> <PERSON> Wasserman </PERSON> said. The fire moved within 100 yards of <ORGANIZATION> Summit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Elementary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>, closed earlier because of the danger, forcing officials to relocate a firefighter staging area set up there, <PERSON> Wasserman </PERSON> said. Flames later roared past and spared the school. While air tankers and helicopters were grounded by the swirling winds, 1,200 firefighters on the ground made desperate, often-futile stands on ridge crests they had cleared of brush. `` It gets to the top of a ridge and the winds carry it so fast we lose containment right there,'' said <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Grisamore </PERSON>, a spokeswoman for the Department of Forestry. The 6,000-acre-plus fire broke out Wednesday, when it burned down a $ 445,000 ranch house and two outbuildings in the area 60 miles east of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. Officials said it was 30 percent contained, but there was no estimate on how long it would take to put it out. Temperatures soaring into the 100s accompanied the <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Anas </LOCATION>, the `` devil winds'' spawned by high pressure over <LOCATION> Nevada </LOCATION> that sends compression-heated wind whistling through the mountain canyons to sea. They are often at their worst just as fall brings cool weather and rain to much of the country. The winds also temporarily cost firefighters control of a blaze they started Tuesday to clear overgrown brush. That 675-acre fire was expected to be contained Thursday night.

 <LOCATION> PORT-AU-PRINCE </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ About 10,000 mostly young Haitians danced and chanted through the streets of the capital on Thursday in support of the Sept. 17 military coup that ousted the government of Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Henri </PERSON> <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON>. It was one of the biggest outpourings seen in <LOCATION> Port-au-Prince </LOCATION> since dictator <PERSON> Jean-Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON> fled to <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> during a popular uprising in February 1986. Most of the demonstrators appeared to be in their 20s. They waved banners and placards bearing such slogans as `` Peasants-Workers-Army for Change,'' `` The Constitution Is Our Weapon,'' and `` Oust Macoutes from the Church.'' The Tonton Macoutes are former members of <PERSON> Duvalier </PERSON>'s private police force. The demonstration, called off twice last week, was organized by six civic action groups. One of them, the Confederation of <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Unity </ORGANIZATION>, a coalition advocating democratic reform, backed out of Thursday's events because of fears of a reprisal attack by Tonton Macoutes who are being purged from the army. Authorities arrested two men Wednesday and found submachine guns and grenades in their luxury hotel room, local news reports said. Dr. <PERSON> Louis </PERSON> <PERSON> Roy </PERSON>, who helped write the suspended 1987 constitution, said the demonstration went ahead despite rumors of a possible attack because `` the popular pressure was so great. ... The people are no longer afraid.'' He said <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION> was `` ripe for democracy.'' Rank-and-file soldiers who overthrew <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> and installed Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Prosper </PERSON> <PERSON> Avril </PERSON> as president under a new military government said they wanted to end random, state-sponsored violence and institute democratic reforms, including restoring the constitution and elections for a civilian government. <PERSON> Avril </PERSON> has named a predominantly civilian Cabinet and has pledged to restore the constitution. On Wednesday he met with <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>'s main opposition leaders. He has said his military government is provisional, but has not set a date for elections. He says they probably will not be held for another two to 2 -LCB- years. Thursday's demonstration began outside the charred ruins of the <ORGANIZATION> Roman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Catholic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bosco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Church </ORGANIZATION>, where thugs wielding machetes, guns, clubs and spikes killed 13 people and wounded more than 70 during a Mass on Sept. 11. Soldiers who overthrew <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> cited the massacre as a factor in triggering their revolt. In the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>, where <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> and his wife and daughter live in exile, Archbishop <PERSON> Nicolas </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Jesus </PERSON> <PERSON> Lopez </PERSON> <PERSON> Rodriguez </PERSON> of <PERSON> Santo </PERSON> <PERSON> Domingo </PERSON> said Thursday he opposed granting <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> political asylum or letting him stay there. He told reporters after celebrating Mass, `` I think that the presence of this gentleman is harmful. To grant him asylum just to get it over with would not be convenient either for the <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>, a people who want to get on the road to peace.'' The <LOCATION> Dominican </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> shares the island of <LOCATION> Hispaniola </LOCATION> with <LOCATION> Haiti </LOCATION>. Speculation rose that <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON> would be flying out of the country soon, but a <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman said the government `` still has not made a decision about <PERSON> Namphy </PERSON>'s situation.''

 Within hours after Discovery rocketed into orbit Thursday, the astronauts flung open its cargo bay doors and deployed a $ 100 million communications satellite that ground controllers will use to talk to crews on future missions. The Tracking and Data Relay Satellite, attached to a two-stage solid booster rocket, was pushed from a tilt-table that was raised out of the shuttle bay. The cargo waltzed away at about 2.7 mph about six hours after Discovery's successful liftoff from <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canaveral </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Fla. </LOCATION>, at 11:37 a.m. EDT. About an hour later, the satellite was sent on its way toward its final orbit with the firing of the rocket's first stage. But first, as a safety precaution, the astronauts maneuvered Discovery 10 miles away and turned its belly toward the <ORGANIZATION> TDRS </ORGANIZATION>. That was done to protect the shuttle's windows from particles flying from the burning rocket propellant. Deploying the satellite was the main mission of the first post-Challenger flight. Another TDRS is in orbit, but a nearly identical one was destroyed in the Challenger explosion Jan. 28, 1986. <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> needs to get the <ORGANIZATION> TDRS </ORGANIZATION> in orbit because it will nearly double the time ground controllers can monitor future shuttle flights. The satellite now in orbit allows controllers to keep track of shuttle about 45 percent of each orbit, but it has had some minor breakdowns and is operating at about 98 percent capacity, space agency officials said. The <ORGANIZATION> TDRS </ORGANIZATION> provides more continuous coverage of manned and unmanned spacecraft orbiting the Earth than <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION>'s worldwide network of ground-based communications tracking systems. The satellite relays signals and data between a spacecraft and a ground terminal at White Sands Missile Range, <LOCATION> N.M. </LOCATION>, which then routes it to the appropriate <ORGANIZATION> NASA </ORGANIZATION> facility. The satellite is thrust into its final orbit 22,300 miles above <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> by an inertial upper stage rocket. A spring-loaded ejection device pushed the <ORGANIZATION> TDRS </ORGANIZATION> and the booster from the cargo bay. The first stage of the rocket fired about an hour after it the satellite was released from the shuttle. The second stage ignites about 5 -LCB- hours later and the satellite reaches its final orbit about a half-hour after that. It then undergoes several weeks of checks before it is considered operational. The satellite and booster and its carrying cradle weigh about 45,000 pounds, making it the heaviest payload to be carried aboard a shuttle, <ORGANIZATION> Johnson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> officials said. The satellite itself weighs about 5,000 pounds and it has two 50-pound antennas that look like giant umbrellas. The <ORGANIZATION> TDRS </ORGANIZATION>' final stationary orbit will be over the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> near the <LOCATION> Gilbert </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION>.

 One of the many satellites crowding the orbital skies above the <LOCATION> Earth </LOCATION> threatened for a time Thursday to affect the launch of space shuttle Discovery. When liftoff of the spacecraft was delayed, engineers in launch control at <LOCATION> Cape </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Canaveral </LOCATION> announced that though the shuttle could be launched as late 2:30 p.m. EDT, there were two brief periods that were restricted because of satellites passing near Discovery's flight path Officials at the <ORGANIZATION> Johnson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Space </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> said they received a Collision Avoidance warning from the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Missile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Command </ORGANIZATION>, which keeps track of the hundreds of satellites in orbit. Flight Director <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Coen </PERSON> said the warning had no effect on the Discovery mission because the shuttle was launched at 11:37 a.m. EDT, almost a half hour before the first of the two resticted times. <PERSON> Coen </PERSON> said the satellites that triggered the warnings were not identifed by the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION>.

<TEXT>
 U.S-mediated peace talks between <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and an Angolan-Cuban delegation, which began with high expectations, ended without an agreement Thursday and a new round will be scheduled, a communique said. It said the participants will recommend to <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> Secretary-General <PERSON> Javier </PERSON> <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> that plans proceed for the independence of <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, or <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>. Thursday was the 10th anniversary of U.N. Resolution 435, a one-year transition plan for <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>'s independence. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> has said it will begin implementation of the resolution on Nov. 1. Conference sources said a timetable for withdrawal from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> of an estimated 50,000 Cuban troops remained the big obstacle to an agreement at the talks in <LOCATION> Brazzaville </LOCATION>, which began Monday. The sources demanded anonymity. The communique released by all four parties _ the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Cuba </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> _ said: `` The delegations have expressed their firm intention to resolve the remaining problems after consultations with their respective governments.'' The sources said <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> apparently accepted a compromise proposal for a phased withdrawal over 24 months, but <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> diplomats demanded more time. <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION> government sources, who also spoke on condition of anonymity, meanwhile disclosed that President <PERSON> Mobutu </PERSON> <PERSON> Sese </PERSON> <PERSON> Seko </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION> will meet Saturday with South African President P.W. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> to discuss a regional peace agreement. <PERSON> Botha </PERSON> and South African Prime Minister <PERSON> Roelof </PERSON> <PERSON> Botha </PERSON>, no relation, were to fly to <PERSON> Mobutu </PERSON>'s ancestral village in northern <LOCATION> Zaire </LOCATION> near the <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> African </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION> frontier for the meeting. The sources said <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> requested the meeting, which was being billed as part of an African-led initiative to negotiate an end to <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>'s 13-year-old civil war. Government radio in <LOCATION> Bangui </LOCATION>, capital of the <LOCATION> Central </LOCATION> <LOCATION> African </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Republic </LOCATION>, said a South African delegation led by <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Babb </PERSON> of the <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Affairs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> met with President <PERSON> Andre </PERSON> <PERSON> Kolinga </PERSON> to report on the <LOCATION> Brazzaville </LOCATION> talks. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomats had hoped the <LOCATION> Brazzaville </LOCATION> talks would produce a peace pact which would clear the way for <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>'s Marxist government to begin negotiations with its guerrilla opponents. Civil war has wracked <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> since it gained independence from <LOCATION> Portugal </LOCATION> in 1975. President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> told the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> on Monday that an agreement resulting in a <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> withdrawal from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> was near. Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> cited <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> as an example of a foreign policy success for the Reagan-Bush administration. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> has withdrawn its troops from <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> under a truce negotiated during the present series of talks. It had demanded withdrawal of Cuban troops within 12 months if it was to go ahead with its stated aim of granting independence to <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION>'s southern neighbor <LOCATION> Angola </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Cuban </LOCATION> initially asked four years for the withdrawal. At <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> headquarters in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Perez </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Cuellar </PERSON> said a team of 20 <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> experts left Thursday for <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION> to survey that South African-ruled territory prior to implementation of the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> plan for independence. The <ORGANIZATION> Security </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Council </ORGANIZATION> met in formal session to adopt a statement calling upon <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> to free <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>. The council noted `` the expressed readiness of the <ORGANIZATION> South-West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Africa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> to sign and observe a cease-fire agreement with <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>.'' <ORGANIZATION> SWAPO </ORGANIZATION> is a guerrilla organization fighting South African administration of <LOCATION> Namibia </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>'s rule is in violation of <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> resolutions. Police in <LOCATION> Windhoek </LOCATION>, capital of <LOCATION> South-West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, used whips and batons Thursday to break up a demonstration outside the gates of the territorial administrator, witnesses said. The protest was to commemorate the 10th anniversary of Resolution 435. About 200 demonstrators marched from the main post office to the administrator's hilltop residence. The noisy, but peaceful group blocked traffic and police moved in with anti-riot vehicles and charged the protesters. Some demonstrators and two journalists were slightly injured, witnesses said. No arrests were reported.

 The battle between <ORGANIZATION> Trans </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> owner <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> and the carrier's unions spilled into <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday, with lawmakers dueling over whether a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> subcommittee should scrutinize the dispute. The two sides in the fight over <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>'s financial restructuring of <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> spelled out their arguments at a hearing by the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Public </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Works </ORGANIZATION> investigations subcommittee. As the session began, Rep. <PERSON> Bud </PERSON> <PERSON> Shuster </PERSON>, R-Pa., said <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION>'s unions had asked the subcommittee to hold the hearing He said that <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> _ of which <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> is the largest shareholder and whose management he battled earlier this year in a proxy contest _ has assisted the unions. <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Maneri </PERSON>, speaking from the company's offices in <LOCATION> White </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Plains </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, would say only that the firm `` takes no role in these hearings beyond that of an observer. <PERSON> Shuster </PERSON> said the unions had even sought unsuccessfully to have the panel issue a subpoena to <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> to force him to appear as a witness. <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> did not attend the hearing. `` I do n't think it's proper people should try to use this committee as a weapon in this kind of dispute,'' <PERSON> Shuster </PERSON> said. He and other Republicans said the hearing should not be interpreted as supporting a <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> investigation of <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION>. Democrats, however, said the internal changes being made at the airline are worth examining. Subcommittee Chairman <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Oberstar </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-Minn </LOCATION>., said there are `` serious and legitimate questions surrounding the financial maneuverings at <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION>. He said it was appropriate for the panel to study the carrier's finances, and the <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>'s procedures for determining whether an airline's management is qualified to operate the carrier In August, the <ORGANIZATION> Independent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Flight </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Attendants </ORGANIZATION> asked the department to block <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>'s restructuring plan. The union charged that the corporate raider simply wanted to extract cash from <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION>, ignoring needs for new equipment and threatening thousands of jobs. The department investigation is continuing. Union leaders contended Thursday that <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> acted for his own benefit in initiating a plan to buy out public shareholders and sell off assets, leaving the airline with $ 2.5 billion worth of debt and an aging fleet of planes. Capt. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Ashwood </PERSON>, chairman of the branch of the <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Line </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pilots </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> that represents <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION>'s 3,200 pilots, said the restructuring `` signals the beginning of a possibly irreversible tailspin into bankruptcy.'' But <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Buckstein </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> senior vice president, said that since gaining control of the airline in 1986, <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> has turned around an ailing company. He said <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> has been exploring buying new planes, setting up a domestic hub and adding new flights. `` <ORGANIZATION> TWA </ORGANIZATION> views this as but one step in its evolution as a more effective competitive force in the airline industry,'' <PERSON> Buckstein </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>US Demands Nicaragua Rescind Restrictions on Envoys</HEAD>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> called on the Nicaraguan government Thursday to rescind new restrictions that force <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomats who leave <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> to delay their return for three weeks. Sandinista authorities informed the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Embassy </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Managua </LOCATION> of the change in procedures last week during a period when the two countries were embroiled in a dispute over a proposed visit _ since canceled _ to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> by President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON>. The new regulations require embassy personnel leaving <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> to seek re-entry visas only outside <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. In addition, a waiting period of 15 working days was imposed. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said the shift means that diplomatic personnel who must leave <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> for any reason, including official business, family emergencies or medical treatment, will not be able to re-enter <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> for three weeks. Beforehand, re-entry visas could be obtained prior to departure from <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> with five days advance notice. `` We believe that the Nicaraguan government should rescind this latest action,'' a department statement said, adding that `` appropriate responses'' are being considered. It also noted that the new measures aggravate the existing personnel shortage at the embassy. Last July 11, the <ORGANIZATION> Sandinistas </ORGANIZATION> expelled eight <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> diplomats on grounds they were interfering in <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>'s internal affairs. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> responded by expelling eight Nicaraguan diplomats from <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. Neither side has allowed the other to send replacement envoys. Last week, <PERSON> Ortega </PERSON> canceled plans to visit the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> because, he said, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> would not allow a full delegation to accompany him. The <ORGANIZATION> State </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> contended that visas applications of most of the official party were turned in too late.

 Life with heavyweight champion <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> has been `` torture ... pure hell ... worse than anything I could possibly imagine,'' his wife, actress <PERSON> Robin </PERSON> <PERSON> Givens </PERSON>, said in a TV interview scheduled for broadcast Friday. Describing her husband's `` extremely volatile temper,'' <PERSON> Givens </PERSON> told <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Walters </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION>'s `` 20-20'' that <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> has `` a side to him that's scary. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> is intimidating, to say the least. I think that there's a time when he can not control his temper, and that's frightening.'' <PERSON> Givens </PERSON> gave no indication that she wanted to sever her ties with the man she married in February. With a taciturn <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> seated next to her on a couch at the couple's <LOCATION> Bernardsville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.J. </LOCATION>, home, <PERSON> Givens </PERSON> spoke of their recent trip to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION>, where she was involved in taping for the TV show `` Head of the Class,'' and of her husband's behavior `` He shakes. He pushes. He swings. ... Recently I've become afraid. I mean very, very much afraid. For instance, in <LOCATION> Russia </LOCATION>, I was afraid. <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> is a manic depressive,'' <PERSON> Givens </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Givens </PERSON> said the consequences for <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> would be dire _ even life-threatening _ if <PERSON> Givens </PERSON>, her mother, <PERSON> Ruth </PERSON> <PERSON> Roper </PERSON>, and sister left the fighter. `` He would be alone. ... And I do n't want that to happen,'' <PERSON> Givens </PERSON> said, fighting back tears. `` He would have gotten so, so bad that I think maybe one day he would have been more deliberate and killed himself or hurt somebody else.'' <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON>, 22, told <PERSON> Walters </PERSON> that he loves his wife and would not stand in her way if she chose to leave. `` My wife would just have to ask for it and she has every penny I have,'' said <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON>, a multimillionaire. `` She can leave right now ... take everything I have and just leave. She has the right to do it. She has ... the power to do it.'' <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON>, the youngest heavyweight champion ever, has had a stormy year. He gave away a $ 100,000 automobile after a minor accident, cracked a bone in his right hand in a late-night fight on a <LOCATION> Harlem </LOCATION> street and was reported to have threatened suicide before he drove his car into a tree. Last week, the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> quoted <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> as saying he had been diagnosed as being manic-depressive. The newspaper also reported that <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> had several violent episodes during his recent trip to the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and allegedly had chased <PERSON> Givens </PERSON>, <PERSON> Roper </PERSON> and a secretary through their hotel. The <ORGANIZATION> Post </ORGANIZATION> said that after returning to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> last week, <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> had a tearful talk with <PERSON> Givens </PERSON>, <PERSON> Roper </PERSON> and psychiatrist <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> McCurtis </PERSON> during which <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> admitted being out of control at times and agreed to undergo treatment. <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON>, in the television interview Thursday, said, `` This is a situation in which I'm dealing with my illness.'' <PERSON> Givens </PERSON> told <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> that a distraught <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> called <PERSON> Roper </PERSON> one day `` and said he needed help.'' <PERSON> Givens </PERSON> said her mother arranged for <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> to see a doctor and receive treatment. `` I do n't know what <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Tyson </PERSON> would be without my mother. What we would be. I mean, she's been the glue that's kept us together,'' <PERSON> Givens </PERSON> said.

 It was billed as an effort to `` debug'' the Lower East Side by getting people to turn in their cockroaches for prizes Thursday. A sort of <PERSON> Roach </PERSON> <PERSON> Raffle </PERSON>. A Bug Bazaar. The big pesticide company that sponsored the <ORGANIZATION> Great </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Cockroach </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Contest </ORGANIZATION> handed out free samples to make sure the little pests were brought in dead. Banners were strung. Insect experts were assembled. The contest was sponsored by the <ORGANIZATION> Raid </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Insect </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION>, in cooperation with some Lower East Side community groups. The aim was n't to rid the entire <LOCATION> Lower </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Side </LOCATION> of cockroaches _ just one block of brick tenements on East 10th Street between Avenues B and <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Raid </PERSON> handed out fumigants _ little canisters designed to flush out and kill cockroaches _ along with tiny plastic, zip-locked body bags for the deceased. A `` Countdown Headquarters'' was set up on a vacant lot, complete with an insect zoo. And the contest officials waited for the results. In the first couple of hours, about 10 people showed up, gingerly holding their little bags in front of them. The roach count varied, but generally ranged from about a dozen to 100. Each entrant was given a bucket filled with Raid products and a T-shirt. And they were allowed to enter a raffle with a grand prize that would range from $ 200 to $ 1,000, depending on how many roaches were brought in by the end of the day. `` The main point we're trying to make is, you ca n't solve your cockroach problem by just spraying once,'' said entomologist <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>. `` They've just been around too long, it's a sophisticated insect and it requires some diligence to get rid of it.'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> is a man who photographs bugs for a hobby and had no qualms about letting an inch-and-a-half long <LOCATION> Madagascar </LOCATION> Hissing Cockroach _ one of the prize specimens in the insect zoo _ crawl around on his finger. `` That's a cockroach?'' a passerby asked, disbelieving. `` That's a cockroach,'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> replied proudly. `` Oh my God!'' gasped a woman, who sounded horrified. <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> rattled off cockroach facts. Sixty cockroaches weigh one ounce. Eight-thousand weigh one pound. If a single cockroach gave birth and all her offspring survived, she would have 10 million descendants in one year's time. Near day's end, a flood of entrants appeared with cockroaches _ 11,000 bugs in all. The grand prize _ $ 1,000 _ went to a man named <PERSON> Mikal </PERSON> <PERSON> Reich </PERSON>. Eleven-thousand cockroaches is nothing to scoff at. Still, one <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> study in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> turned up 27,000 cockroaches in a single apartment. At best, <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said, the contest may have exterminated half the roaches on the one block of East 10th Street. `` We have been waging war against the cockroach for a long time,'' he said. `` I will not suggest we are winning the war, but we are winning more of the battles.''

<HEAD>Mitterrand Agrees to Host Conference on Chemical Weapons</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By MERRILL HARTSON</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 French President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> on Thursday accepted President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s suggestion that <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> host an international conference aimed at improving enforcement of a ban on the use of chemical weapons, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> official said. <PERSON> Rozanne </PERSON> <PERSON> Ridgway </PERSON>, assistant secretary of state for Canadian and <LOCATION> European </LOCATION> affairs, said <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> had voiced a willingness to have the conference in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>, although she emphasized that no date has been set for such a meeting. <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> met with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, and then the pair walked around the Rose Garden for about 10 minutes before joining top-level aides for a broad discussion of bilateral issues. He stopped by the Capitol, where he urged Americans to observe the bicentennial of his nation's 1789 revolution, telling an audience that the two nations `` always go side by side.'' <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> was joining <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> for a private dinner Thursday night in the White House residence before the French president was to head home. During a picture-taking session with <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> earlier in the Oval Office, <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> was asked why <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> had apparently reversed its previous position of wanting to keep a stock of chemical weapons. `` We wanted to contribute to general agreement on the true cessation of the chemical use,'' the president replied through an interpreter. There are already conventions -LRB- agreements -RRB- but they have not been respected. Therefore, a conference is needed to do away with that.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>, in his farewell speech to the <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> on Monday, deplored the use of poison gas and chemical warfare, saying the use of these weapons `` jeopardizes the moral and legal strictures that have held these weapons in check since World War I.'' <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> said the tragedy of chemical weapon use in the Iran-Iraq war should `` spark reaffirmation of the -LRB- 1925 -RRB- <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> protocol outlawing the use of chemical weapons.'' And he called upon the 125 nations who signed the agreement `` to convene a conference to consider actions that we can take together to reverse the serious erosion of this treaty.'' The conference that <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> agreed to host in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> would deal only with the treaty protocol outlawing the use of chemical weapons, and would not confront the question of production of these weapons. This is being dealt with separately at the Conference on Disarmament in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Ridgway </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> believed <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> should be the host country for a conference on banning the use of chemical weapons since the original copies of the 1925 treaty protocol are kept by the French government. She said <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> quickly acceded to <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s request, but that `` there was no discussion of a date.'' <PERSON> Ridgway </PERSON> also said she did not know whether the conference, likely a one-day affair, would take place before <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> leaves office next Jan. 20. `` <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, of course, has been a very active participant in the negotiations on banning chemical weapons,'' she said, without getting into the issue of the separate talks in <LOCATION> Geneva </LOCATION> on prohibiting the production of these weapons. <PERSON> Ridgway </PERSON> said she did not know whether <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> had talked with <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> about the Americans being held hostage by pro-Iranian elements in <LOCATION> Lebanon </LOCATION>. At the Capitol, where he witnessed the signing of a joint congressional resolution commemorating both the French revolution and the proclamation, also in 1789, of the Declaration of the Rights of Man, <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> stressed the links between <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. `` We were at your side at the very beginning of your history,'' <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> said, invoking <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>'s decision to send military aid to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> during the revolutionary war against <LOCATION> England </LOCATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> approved the Bill of Rights in 1789, and the congressional resolution signed Thursday states that the two acts proclaimed `` the sanctity of human rights on both sides of the <LOCATION> Atlantic </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION> ... guaranteeing them for future generations.'' The signing of the resolution by <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Wright </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Majority Leader <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Byrd </PERSON>, D-W. <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, took place in Statuary Hall, a historic chamber which was the meeting place of the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> in the early 1800's and which now is ringed by a collection of statues of American Several speakers noted that the <PERSON> Marquis </PERSON> <PERSON> de </PERSON> <PERSON> Lafayette </PERSON>, a prominent figure in both the American and French revolutions, addressed the first joint meeting of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in the chamber in 1824. `` I know this historic chamber is filled with the statues of famous Americans,'' <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> remarked, peering out into the hall from a podium draped in red cloth. `` I ca n't see them because of the television lights _ but I know they are out there.'' After the 30-minute ceremony, the president of <LOCATION> France </LOCATION> went to see for himself. Ignoring attempts to whisk him out a side door, he broke away from a group of dignitaries and circled the room, peering up at the statues and shaking the hands of people nearby.

 Federal regulators on Thursday announced the most recent in a spate of savings association rescues, pledging $ 281 million in assistance to a <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> institution. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> said it would provide a promissory note of $ 238 million and various other forms of assistance worth an estimated $ 43 million to <ORGANIZATION> Downey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Newport </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Downey </PERSON> is taking over the insolvent <ORGANIZATION> Butterfield </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Santa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ana </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, and investing $ 40 million in the deal, from which it is getting tax benefits <PERSON> Butterfield </PERSON>, with loans and other assets of $ 541 million and deposits and other liabilities of $ 694 million, has been under government-supervised management since August 1985. It was one of several thrift institutions in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> that embarked in the early 1980s on programs of rapid growth, investing deposits solicited through professional brokers into non-traditional activities, including a chain of fast-food restaurants. <PERSON> Butterfield </PERSON>'s two offices, one in <LOCATION> Santa </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ana </LOCATION> and the other in <LOCATION> Bakersfield </LOCATION>, will remain open and all deposits will transfer with the sale to <LOCATION> Downey </LOCATION>, which has $ 3.1 billion in assets and 42 branches in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, the bank board said. The bank board said it has closed or merged 116 institutions so far this year. Sixty of those deals, requiring a government commitment of nearly $ 14 billion, have come since mid-August. Two of those transactions have involved large <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> institutions: <ORGANIZATION> Bell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> San </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mateo </ORGANIZATION>, which required $ 565 million in government aid, and <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Savings </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stockton </ORGANIZATION>, which is getting $ 2 billion in the largest-ever rescue of a single thrift institution. The latest rescue comes amid intense debate over whether taxpayer money will be needed to bail out the savings industry. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ' </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Accounting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> says as much as $ 50 billion will be required to clean up the mess, at least some of it from taxpayers. On Thursday, Democratic presidential candidate <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> blamed the crisis on <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration policies which permitted S & amp; Ls to move from traditional home mortgage lending to risky new areas. The campaign of Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> responded that the Democratic <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> was to blame for cutting back an administration plan to tap the industry, not the taxpayer, to bolster the government fund insuring S & amp; L deposits.

 A former state senator who authorities said faked his own drowning and hid out on a remote island pleaded guilty Thursday in federal court to racketeering. <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Friedland </PERSON>, 50, entered the plea before Chief U.S. District Court Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerry </PERSON> just four days after testimony began in his pension fund fraud trial. The former legislator from <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> had been charged with masterminding a plot to defraud $ 20 million from the pension fund of <ORGANIZATION> North </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brunswick </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Teamsters </ORGANIZATION> Local 701. In return for the guilty plea, Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> <PERSON> Attorney </PERSON> <PERSON> J </PERSON> <PERSON> Imbert </PERSON> said the government has agreed to drop the remaining charges, which include mail and wire fraud, against <PERSON> Friedland </PERSON> when he is sentenced on Oct. 28. `` We arrived at an agreement that was suitable to the government,'' said <PERSON> Imbert </PERSON>, adding that <PERSON> Friedland </PERSON> faces a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison. The plea came during negotiations after Thursday's court session. `` Everybody got a fair shake,'' said <PERSON> Peter </PERSON> <PERSON> Willis </PERSON>, one of <PERSON> Friedland </PERSON>'s attorneys. <PERSON> Willis </PERSON> said he thinks his client will receive less than the maximum prison sentence. `` I think he will have a life after prison,'' he said. Federal authorities say <PERSON> Friedland </PERSON> staged a fake drowning in the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION> on Labor Day 1985, just before he was indicted with three co-defendants _ two union pension fund trustees and the fund's lawyer <PERSON> Friedland </PERSON>, a disbarred lawyer who had been convicted in 1980 of taking kickbacks, was the subject of an extensive manhunt until he was arrested Dec. 12 in the <LOCATION> Maldive </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> in the <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Ocean </LOCATION>. Assistant <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> Attorney <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Chertoff </PERSON> said he was satisfied with the case's outcome. `` The court and the jury has been spared a significant amount of time,'' he said. <PERSON> Chertoff </PERSON> said he was not entirely surprised by the guilty plea. `` In part, as he was confronted with what was unquestionable evidence of his guilt, I think he was motivated by personal embarrassment _ if nothing else _ to plead and put an end to the proceedings,'' <PERSON> Chertoff </PERSON> said. `` A chapter is over in <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Friedland </PERSON>'s life.'' The three co-defendants were convicted in December of accepting cash kickbacks from <PERSON> Friedland </PERSON>. <PERSON> Friedland </PERSON> and former Union County Assemblyman <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON> were accused of defrauding $ 20 million from the Local 701 pension fund through a bogus mortgage company they established in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, according to the indictment. <PERSON> Higgins </PERSON>, already in prison for racketeering, testified against <PERSON> Friedland </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 Former millionaire developer <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kroh </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> was found guilty Thursday of defrauding banks in an attempt to get loans to keep his failing company afloat. A jury deliberated just over five hours before returning the guilty verdict. <PERSON> Kroh </PERSON>, 47, looked stunned briefly but then remained impassive. <PERSON> Kroh </PERSON> was found guilty of 13 counts of conspiracy, bank fraud, wire fraud, receiving stolen money and forging his wife's name on loan application papers. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Whipple </PERSON> said he would set a sentencing date after a pre-sentence report was complete, probably within 30 days. <PERSON> Kroh </PERSON> could receive a maximum sentence of more than 80 years in prison. No <PERSON> Kroh </PERSON> family members were present when the verdict was read, including <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kroh </PERSON>, 50, who testified against his brother under a plea bargain. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Kroh </PERSON>, a co-owner of the 77-year-old <ORGANIZATION> Kroh </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Brothers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Development </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, pleaded guilty in April to fraud and conspiracy and served two months of a three-year sentence. The brothers' company collapsed in bankruptcy in February 1987. The government had charged that <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kroh </PERSON> falsified financial statements to banks in order to obtain personal loans and then funneled the money into his company. Much of the government's case was based on testimony by a former company comptroller, <PERSON> Jacob </PERSON> <PERSON> Mondschein </PERSON>, who was granted immunity. <PERSON> Mondschein </PERSON> said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Kroh </PERSON> told him to do whatever necessary to keep the company afloat. <PERSON> Kroh </PERSON> knew he was `` kiting'' checks between at least four banks to cover mounting deficits and overdrafts, <PERSON> Mondschein </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Kroh </PERSON>, who testified that he was never aware of the full extent of his company's troubles, said he did n't know <PERSON> Mondschein </PERSON> was kiting checks. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Kroh </PERSON> said he was unaware of the company's financial problems until it was on the verge of bankruptcy and said his brother handled that end of the business. Several bank officials testified they did n't question the figures on the company's loan applications because of its solid reputation in the area.

 Thousands of mourners waving <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> flags and chanting `` <ORGANIZATION> PLO </ORGANIZATION> yes, <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> no!'' bore the body of former <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> Mayor <PERSON> Rashad </PERSON> <PERSON> Shawwa </PERSON> to his grave Thursday. The army imposed a curfew on about 210,000 Palestinians in eight <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> refugee camps and in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> neighborhoods to prevent riots during the funeral. Hundreds of <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers stood guard on rooftops along the central <PERSON> Omar </PERSON> <PERSON> El </PERSON> <PERSON> Mukhtar </PERSON> street in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> and watched the funeral procession without intervening. <PERSON> Shawwa </PERSON>, 79, an outspoken critic of the 21-year Israeli occupation of the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, died of a heart attack Tuesday. <PERSON> Shawwa </PERSON> was twice deposed as mayor by <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> military authorities but was considered a moderate by Israeli politicians. About 2,000 youths followed the coffin, carrying a large outlawed Palestinian flag and chanting such slogans as `` We shall die and <LOCATION> Palestine </LOCATION> will live!'' and `` God is great!,'' an Arab reporter in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> said. At the entrance to the <LOCATION> Amari </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Mosque </LOCATION>, the largest in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>, youths draped the coffin in a <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> flag. Five masked Arabs, waving another flag, climbed to the roof of the mosque, cheered by the crowd. At one point, dozens of youths started stoning <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldiers and reporters, but adults ordered them to stop. At <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION>'s Maghazi refugee camp, two boys, ages 12 and 13, were wounded in the legs during a clash with troops, hospital officials said. The army confirmed the injuries. Another 12-year-old Palestinian was shot and wounded in the stomach in a clash in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> city of <LOCATION> Nablus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ittihad </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Hospital </LOCATION> officials said. A 23-year-old man was wounded in the leg in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Tulkarm </LOCATION>, they said. The army said it was checking the reports. Since the uprising against Israeli rule began Dec. 8 in the <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Bank </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION>, 278 Palestinians have been killed. Six Israelis also have died. <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> took the territories from <LOCATION> Jordan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION> in the 1967 <LOCATION> Middle </LOCATION> <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> war. On <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION> radio Thursday, Chief of Staff Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Shomron </PERSON> defended the army's use of plastic bullets against <LOCATION> Palestinian </LOCATION> demonstrators, saying it enabled soldiers `` to break up protests with minimal casualties.'' His comments followed sharp rebukes by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION> and charges by <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> officials that plastic bullets caused casualties to soar. The army introduced plastic bullets last month to allow soldiers to shoot at ringleaders while keeping out of the range of the stones. Palestinian hospital officials in <LOCATION> Gaza </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Strip </LOCATION> said three Palestinians were killed by plastic bullets on Tuesday. Israeli army officials, speaking anonymously, confirmed the new weapon caused at least two of the deaths. Hundreds of Palestinian prisoners rioted Wednesday at <LOCATION> Ketziot </LOCATION> prison camp in <LOCATION> Israel </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Negev </LOCATION> desert, hurling rocks at two lookout posts and injuring an <LOCATION> Israeli </LOCATION> soldier, the daily <ORGANIZATION> Haaretz </ORGANIZATION> reported. It said the riot broke out after soldiers tried to handcuff a prisoner caught outside his tent at night, allegedly without permission. `` They -LRB- the prisoners -RRB- just raised their voices and fists. Then they calmed down. Nobody was hurt,'' said an army spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity.

 Republican <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> accused presidential rival <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> of `` demagoguery'' Thursday, saying the Democrat had criticized him for taking a Social Security stance <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> himself had taken. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who cast a tie-breaking <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> vote in 1985 to approve legislation that included a one-year freeze on Social Security cost-of-living adjustments, said that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>, in a vote on a National Governors Conference resolution, supported `` exactly the same thing he was attacking me on the other night.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> acknowledged Thursday night that at a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> meeting in 1985, he first voted to drop Social Security from a list of programs to be covered by a proposed one-year freeze in cost-of-living increases. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said he lent his support for the overall freeze after the attempt to protect Social Security increases was voted down. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor said in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> that he cast the vote `` as a general expression of my concern for the deficit, but I made it very, very clear that I was opposed to cutting cost-of-living increases for Social Security recipients.'' `` There were a great many of us -LRB- governors -RRB- who opposed any cut in Social Security, but we at least wanted to give the administration a message that we were concerned about the deficit,'' he said. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> commented in a news conference, his first in two weeks, and also hit back at <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> on other recent criticism leveled by the <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> candidate: _ <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> defended running mate <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, suggesting it `` shows a certain insecurity, a certain weakness'' for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> to attack the No 2 man on the presidential ticket. _ He also rejected <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' reference to a `` Hall of Shame'' in the Reagan-Bush administration of officials who have been convicted of crimes or otherwise left office under a cloud The vice president said, `` How indelicate of him to mention such a subject. ... I could hardly believe it, but this from the same man that attacked our president by that vicious, horrible analogy of a fish rotting from the head down.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said last summer that President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> must both accept responsibility for the <ORGANIZATION> Pentagon </ORGANIZATION> procurement scandal and other administration problems. He said, `` There's an old <LOCATION> Greek </LOCATION> saying and I suspect the Italians have the same one. You know: ` The fish rots from the head first.' It starts from the top.'' On Social Security, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> denied he would `` raid'' the system as <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has suggested. And he said, `` I was a little surprised to see this demagoguery from the man who had exactly the same position that the president had on that one-year slipping of the COLAs.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> opened his campaign day by seizing the space shuttle launch as a symbol for his campaign, telling a flag-waving crowd in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Charles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, that `` We're back. America is back.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> later said he hoped he could attend next week's shuttle landing in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, which would be a telegenic event for his campaign. Asked if he would invite <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> to also be at the landing, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said, `` That would be making a political event of it _ the two of us there. I certainly have no plans to do that, gracious though it may be.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> also put some distance between himself and the idea of a quick manned mission to <LOCATION> Mars </LOCATION> _ a mission endorsed in the <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> platform _ and a proposal for a `` Mission to Planet Earth'' orbiting observation platform. `` I would stop well short of saying the first thing I will do as president is going to <LOCATION> Mars </LOCATION>. As a long-term goal and objective, it is an outstanding goal and objective,'' he said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has made <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s running mate, <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, a prime target, questioning his competence and his readiness to step into the presidency if necessary. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, who rarely mentions <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> in the campaign, said, `` I think it's rather demeaning for their head of the ticket to keep going after <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>. It shows a certain insecurity, a certain weakness on his part.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> `` will do just fine'' in his debate next Wednesday with Sen. <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' running mate. Among the questions <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was asked during his news conference was whether homosexual couples should be allowed to adopt children, to which he responded, `` No. I do n't think they should.'' He said a child should have a mother and a father, adding that there was `` much more love in a situation like that, lasting love.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has stated similar views and has been criticized by homosexual-rights groups for a <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> state policy favoring married couples in granting adoptions. For the first time, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> suggested in a speech that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> would follow the recommendations of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Civil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Liberties </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> in picking <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> judges, if he is elected. Asked later to explain why he said that, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said merely, `` I think it's a good question to ask. All he has to do is say no, they wo n't have any influence on him.'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> spoke to a crowd of nearly a thousand people in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Charles </LOCATION>, which boasts it is the oldest city on the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, and then flew to <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION> for a rally at <ORGANIZATION> Macomb </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Community </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Mount </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Clemens </LOCATION> and another one in Grand Rapids. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> hammered <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> with one-liners. `` This is the show-me state,'' he told the <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> rally. `` My opponent acts as if it's the snow-me state.'' He said that when <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> ended their debate last Sunday, `` It was so thick I wanted to borrow that 24-year-old snowblower that he has in his garage.'' He criticized <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> anew for his plan to cut the budget deficit by collecting delinquent and evaded taxes. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> would have to double the number of <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> agents and `` set'em loose on the American people'' to collect those taxes. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> has said he would add 6 percent more agents each year. `` I just do n't agree with his vision of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> where the government has a hand in every pocket and a tax agent in every home,'' <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said.

 Mission Control turned the heat on the Discovery astronauts Thursday in an attempt to melt ice out of a cabin air-conditioning system. The ice formed in ducts that feed an evaporator system used to cool the cabin air while the space shuttle is rocketing into orbit. Another cooling system is used by the astronauts while they are in orbit, but <ORGANIZATION> Mission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION> set the cabin thermostat at a high point in hopes of melting the ice out of the evaporator system. The temperatures climbed to 88 degrees, and the humidity remained at a dry 43 percent. The astronauts were told to drink water to avoid dehydration, but the crew members said the sweltering temperatures presented no problems. `` We're not sure how much of an ice buildup we have,'' said <PERSON> Lacey </PERSON> <PERSON> Veach </PERSON>, an astronaut who does the talking to Discovery from <ORGANIZATION> Mission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Control </ORGANIZATION>. `` We have the heaters on to help out with that problem,'' he said. `` We're going to stay in that configuration overnight at least and look at it again in the morning.'' <PERSON> Veach </PERSON> asked the astronauts for their comments `` on the comfort level in the cabin right now.'' `` I think we're pretty comfortable right now, <PERSON> Lacey </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> Hauck </PERSON>, the Discovery commander. He said the crew had found that the two-story cabin of Discovery had a cold room and a warm room, just as do many houses on Earth in the winter. `` If we want to be a little warmer than normal, we come topside -LRB- the flight deck -RRB- and if we want to be a little cooler, we go down to the middeck. So far, we're in good shape.'' If the crew follows the pattern of past shuttle crews, <PERSON> Hauck </PERSON> and pilot <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Covey </PERSON> will sleep in their couches in the warm part of the cabin, and the rest of the crew will sleep in the larger and cooler middeck area below. Among the crew equipment are sleeping bags to help keep protect the astronauts from cold during their rest periods. But if it gets too warm, the astronauts can change out of their flight coveralls and work in shorts and knit shirts.

 <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> chorused praise for <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s triumphant return to space on Thursday, then resumed their sparring in a long-distance campaign fight over Social Security, the environment and political etiquette <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> accused <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> of demagoguery on Social Security, saying his Democratic rival supported a move to curtail cost-of-living benefits in 1985 _ the very step that the vice president has been criticized for by the Democrats. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> acknowledged Thursday night that at a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> meeting in 1985, he first voted to drop Social Security from a list of programs to be covered by a proposed one-year freeze in cost-of-living increases. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said he lent his support for the overall freeze after the attempt to protect Social Security increases was voted down. The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor said in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> that he cast the vote `` as a general expression of my concern for the deficit, but I made it very, very clear that I was opposed to cutting cost-of-living increases for Social Security recipients.'' `` There were a great many of us -LRB- governors -RRB- who opposed any cut in Social Security, but we at least wanted to give the administration a message that we were concerned about the deficit,'' he said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> stood with actor and environmentalist <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Redford </PERSON> at his side as he attacked <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> as a man whom polluters should love. `` Calling <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> an environmentalist is like calling <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> a statesman,'' the Democrat said in a two-sided attack against both members of the Republican ticket. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> came to the youthful <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>'s defense and then got off a double-edged attack of his own when he scoffed at <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' claims of being tough on crime. `` If you believe that, he's got some bottled water from <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> he'd like to sell you,'' the vice president said in a crack about <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> own pollution problems. <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> was in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> getting ready for next Wednesday's nationally televised debate with <ORGANIZATION> Democratic </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential candidate <PERSON> Lloyd </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> campaigned in <LOCATION> Tennessee </LOCATION>, where he had hoped to watch the launch of the space shuttle with a group of schoolchildren. The <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> senator left before the delayed blast-off, but said later, `` It was a spectacular takeoff. OK, Russians, we're back.'' Politicians love to bask in the glow of favorable news, and for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> _ as for <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON> _ the successful launch of the shuttle Discovery more than two and a half years after the Challenger disaster was irresistible. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> had concluded his speech to a campaign crowd in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Charles </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo. </LOCATION>, when he learned from aides the shuttle had been launched. He returned to the platform to tell cheering supporters, `` We're going to keep the edge in space. We're back. <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>'s back. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said he hoped to attend the shuttle landing next week in <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>. Asked at a news conference if he would invite <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> to share the moment with him, the vice president said, `` That would be making a political event of it _ the two of us there. I certainly have no plans to do that, gracious though it may be.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> offered similarly upbeat sentiments about the shuttle in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, opening his speech on the environment by saying it was a `` very successful morning. As all of you know, the space launch was successful. We're very proud of the astronauts.'' So much for the nice talk. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> collected endorsements from several environmental groups and had sure-fire crowd pleaser <PERSON> Redford </PERSON> at his side as he criticized the environmental record compiled by the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration and pledged to step up the pace of toxic waste cleanup. He said that in <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s role as chairman of a task force concerned with government regulation, the vice president had blocked proposals to reduce lead in the air and to clean up toxic wastes. He said that in eight years, the administration has begun cleanup efforts at only 137 of 1,200 toxic waste sites identified as national priorities. `` For the foot-draggers and chronic polluters, I have just one message. You better vote for Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, because if I'm elected the game is over _ no more sweetheart deals and delayed cleanups and half-baked compromises that we've seen over the past seven and a half years.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> also tried to blunt the Republicans' attack on polluted <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>, contending he had fought the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration `` every inch of the way'' in trying to clean it up. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> said that <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> in a vote in the National Governors' Conference supported `` exactly the same thing he was attacking me on the other night -LRB- in their debate -RRB- So I wan na keep that Social Security trust fund sound and I will do that and I will not permit it to be raided for social spending programs.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said during Sunday night's debate that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> would raid the Social Security trust fund to help reduce the deficit. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' own running mate voted twice for Democratic-sponsored budget plans that would have temporarily frozen benefits. He supported a plan in May 1984 which would have delayed cost-of-living increases for one year. A year later, in May 1985, he supported a six-month delay in the COLAs. <PERSON> Bentsen </PERSON>, joining <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> for a fund-raiser in <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, said he was eager to debate <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> next week and characterized the <LOCATION> Indiana </LOCATION> senator as having `` a far-right agenda'' out of the mainstream of <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> voters. `` And believe me, if the radical right gets its way, we'll be living in the 19th century instead of aiming for the year 2000,'' he said. For his part, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> sought to shield his running mate from Democratic attack, saying it was `` rather demeaning'' for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> to criticize the <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> vice presidential candidate. He said it `` shows a certain insecurity, a certain weakness'' on his rival's part <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, firing a barrage of scathing one-liners as he campaigned through Midwestern battlegrounds of <LOCATION> Missouri </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, again criticized <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' plan to crack down on tax cheats. `` I just do n't agree with his vision of <LOCATION> America </LOCATION> where the government has a hand in every pocket and a tax agent in every home,'' he said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> campaign officials say the governor's plan to collect delinquent taxes would require a 6 percent increase of <ORGANIZATION> IRS </ORGANIZATION> agents a year, far less than the doubling that <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> cited.

<TEXT>
 Government troops fired artillery and rockets at <LOCATION> Honduran </LOCATION> military aircraft that violated Nicaraguan airspace near the border, an official newspaper reported Thursday. <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> denied the report. Barricada, the newspaper of the governing Sandinista party, said the Honduran aircraft were not hit. The paper accused <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> of escalating tensions between the two countries by flying over Nicaraguan territory. A <ORGANIZATION> Nicaraguan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the Hondurans `` provoked'' Nicaraguan troops into shooting at the aircraft. The newspaper also said the <ORGANIZATION> Defense </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> reported two shooting incidents Tuesday between Nicaraguan and Honduran troops. It said Honduran troops `` harassed'' two Nicaraguan border observation posts with 50 - and 60-caliber machine gun fire In the Honduran capital of <LOCATION> Tegucigalpa </LOCATION>, armed forces spokesman <PERSON> Juan </PERSON> <PERSON> Sierra </PERSON> <PERSON> Fonseca </PERSON> called the Barricada reports `` absolutely false and alarming because they generate tensions in Central America.'' <PERSON> Eugenio </PERSON> <PERSON> Castro </PERSON>, spokesman with the <ORGANIZATION> Honduran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, also denied both <PERSON> Barricada </PERSON> reports and called them `` absurd.'' <PERSON> Barricada </PERSON> said a helicopter gunship and an F-5 fighter jet from the Honduran air force and a twin-engine plane without identification recently flew over the border towns of <PERSON> Santo </PERSON> <PERSON> Tomas </PERSON> <PERSON> del </PERSON> <PERSON> Nance </PERSON>, <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Pedro </LOCATION> <LOCATION> de </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Potrero </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION> and Somotillo. It did not say when the incident took place. The report quoted Maj. <PERSON> Leonel </PERSON> <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON>, military commander for the Nicaraguan provinces of <LOCATION> Chinandega </LOCATION> and <PERSON> Leon </PERSON>, as saying Sandinista army troops fired on the intruders with artillery and rockets but failed to hit them. <PERSON> Barricada </PERSON> said the incident heightened the possibility of a military confrontation between <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION>. Leftist <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> ally, have been at odds for years over the U.S.-backed Nicaraguan rebels known as Contras. The Contras have long used Honduran territory to launch attacks on <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and for training, supply and base camps. Since the end of overt <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> military aid last February and a truce that began in March, the bulk of the Contra force has been holed up in camps inside <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION> near the border. But Nicaraguan officials have reported a series of border incidents, including incursions or attempted incursions. <PERSON> Martinez </PERSON> said the navy sank six Honduran boats trying to enter Nicaraguan waters in the <LOCATION> Gulf </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Fonseca </LOCATION> on Aug. 20. The gulf divides <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> El </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Salvador </LOCATION>. He said a Sandinista army officer, Lt. <PERSON> Pablo </PERSON> <PERSON> Blanco </PERSON> <PERSON> Torres </PERSON>, died in the incident. <PERSON> Barricada </PERSON> said armed <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> vessels are common in the gulf. The newspaper quoted another regional military commander, Col. <PERSON> Carlos </PERSON> <PERSON> Brenes </PERSON>, as saying Contras have tried to cross into Nicaraguan near the town of <LOCATION> Palo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Chinandega </LOCATION> province. <PERSON> Brenes </PERSON> was quoted as saying Honduran troops have been harassing the border post at <LOCATION> Palo </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Grande </LOCATION> to provide cover for <ORGANIZATION> Contra </ORGANIZATION> rebels sneaking into <LOCATION> Nicaragua </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Honduras </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Brenes </PERSON> said the Hondurans have increased their troop strength in the area, reinforcing the 101st Infantry Brigade and an armored regiment. He said the Sandinista army has not responded with `` any unusal military mobilization.''

 Democrat <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> sternly denounced the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration's environmental record Thursday and said toxic waste polluters `` better vote for Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> because if I'm elected the game is over.'' The <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> governor defended his own record on pollution in <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> _ an object of intense attack by Republican rival <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> _ and said in his cleanup efforts he'd had to fight <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and the administration `` every inch of the way.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> pledged an eight-year cleanup of toxic waste sites as he accepted the endorsement of several environmental groups during an appearance on the <ORGANIZATION> Rutgers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> campus. He was accompanied by actor <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> Redford </PERSON>, who drew squeals and cheers from the large outdoor crowd. `` Hello everybody, I'm <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>,'' joked <PERSON> Redford </PERSON>, whom <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> has been said to resemble. <PERSON> Redford </PERSON>, known for his outspokenness on environmental issues, said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> was `` co-captain'' of an administration that has `` consistently stalled or blocked efforts to clean up our environment.'' A crowd of students, kept to the side of the rally, chanted `` Bush'' and `` Boring'' as <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> spoke. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> paused once and said, `` We've got a certain amount of noise pollution over here.'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> blamed the administration for environmental failures and embarrassments, including the medical wastes that washed up on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> shores this summer, as he delivered a stinging assault on <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>. `` For the foot-draggers and chronic polluters, I have just one message,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` You better vote for Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, because if I'm elected the game is over _ no more of the sweetheart deals and delayed cleanups and half-baked compromises that we've seen over the past seven and a half years.'' `` If you're satisfied with oceans you ca n't swim in, air you have trouble breathing and toxic waste dumps that threaten your health, then vote for Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>,'' he said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' barbs followed <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s declaration in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> several weeks ago that `` I am an environmentalist.'' At the same time, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> ridiculed <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON>, <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>'s running mate. `` Calling <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> an environmentalist is like calling <PERSON> Dan </PERSON> <PERSON> Quayle </PERSON> a statesman ` because <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> has been part of an administration whose environmental policies are hazardous to our health,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. He began the day with a private meeting with <LOCATION> French </LOCATION> President <PERSON> Francois </PERSON> <PERSON> Mitterrand </PERSON> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>. His trip by motorcade to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Brunswick </LOCATION> was interrupted when the limousine he was traveling in had a flat tire on the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Turnpike </LOCATION>. After a five-minute pause, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> was moved to another vehicle and the <ORGANIZATION> Cadillac </ORGANIZATION> limo, its right front tire in shreds, was left behind. From <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Jersey </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> flew to <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION> for a fund-raiser and private meeting with Hispanic leaders. At a news conference upon his arrival, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> explained his support of a <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Governors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> resolution in 1985 that included a one-year-freeze on Social Security cost-of-living increases. The vice president, campaigning in <LOCATION> Michigan </LOCATION>, accused <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> of `` demagoguery'' for criticizing <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> for casting a tie-breaking vote in 1985 in support of legislation imposing such a freeze. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said he wanted to protect Social Security from the freeze on a number of programs. He said he cast the vote `` as a general expression of my concern for the deficit, but I made it very, very clear that I was opposed to cutting cost-of-living increases for Social Security recipients.'' `` There were a great many of us -LRB- governors -RRB- who opposed any cut in Social Security, but we at least wanted to give the administration a message that we were concerned about the deficit,'' he said. In his speech Thursday, <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> blasted the administration, saying cleanup efforts had been begun at only 137 toxic waste sites of the 1,200 sites on the priority list under the Superfund law. He said only 36 had been completed. He pledged that if he is elected cleanup would be completed or `` well under way'' at all the sites within eight years. He offered no estimate of cost but promised to make polluters pay. Issues adviser <PERSON> Victoria </PERSON> <PERSON> Rideout </PERSON> estimated a $ 13 billion cost to begin the cleanup efforts. In a separate statement, the camapign said <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, as head of an administration <ORGANIZATION> Task </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Force </ORGANIZATION> on Regulatory Relief, led efforts to weaken, suspend or kill environmental regulations. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> defended his own actions as governor of <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> in regard to <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION>. `` Today, my friends, we're cleaning it up,'' <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. `` In the course of that cleanup, we've had to fight Mr. <PERSON> Bush </PERSON> and the administration he belongs to every inch of he way.'' He said the administration `` vetoed the clean water act twice and cut the funding for our cleanup project'' and said the <ORGANIZATION> Environmental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Protection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> `` took forever to approve our cleanup plan.'' <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Harbor </LOCATION> remains badly polluted and continues to have barely treated sewage dumped in it. With <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> as governor, <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION> officials filed for waivers to the federally mandated cleanup of the harbor.

 A judge on Thursday declared a mistrial in the weapons-possesion case of syndicated columnist <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON> after the jury reported it was hopelessly deadlocked. Earlier in the day, Judge <PERSON> Arthur </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Superior </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> had re-read his instructions to the jury after the 12-member panel said it was unable to reach a verdict. <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON> has been charged with using an unregistered handgun and ammunition to wound a teen-aged intruder in the back yard of his home last June. He faced a maximum penalty of two years in prison and a $ 2,000 fine if convicted. <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON> said he was convinced that further deliberations would not lead to a verdict. The jury had deliberated about nine hours over two days. One juror, who declined to be identified, told reporters the panel had been in favor of acquittal by a 9-3 margin. A unanimous verdict was required. As <PERSON> Burnett </PERSON> announced his decision, <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON>, who was seated at the defense table, smiled at his attorneys and then at his wife <PERSON> Vivian </PERSON>. He had no comment as he left the courtroom. <PERSON> Claude </PERSON> <PERSON> Bailey </PERSON>, a spokesman for city Corporation Counsel <PERSON> Frederick </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooke </PERSON>, said city officials had not discussed what action to take if the trial ended in a hung jury. <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON>, 63, shot 18-year-old <PERSON> Benjamin </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> in the wrist after <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> and friends had taken an uninvited swim in his backyard pool in the pre-dawn hours of June 14. <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, interviewed by <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION> television station <ORGANIZATION> WRC-TV </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Massachusetts </LOCATION>, where he attends college, said Thursday, `` My mind is pretty clear as to whether or not he had an unregistered weapon because he shot me with it, and there's not a whole lot of confusion about that ... `` I'm not gon na go pool hopping again,'' he said when asked what lessons he had learned from the incident. `` My feelings toward handguns actually have been a lot stronger since this incident.'' The defense built its case around a little-used legal principle called `` entrapment by estoppel.'' The principle holds that a person can not be convicted if he is prosecuted for following advice given him by a government official. <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON> had testified that his son, <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON>, a former <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION> agent, was repeatedly rebuffed by police officials when he tried to register the .22 caliber revolver used in the shooting. The city's handgun ordinance allows only security officers to register weapons, although exemptions commonly are made for law enforcement officers. <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON>'s son also testified that city police told him he was exempt from the registration requirements because he was a law enforcement officer, and that others in his family could have access to the gun as well. `` He -LRB- <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> -RRB- was depending upon the competence and intelligence of those people that the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION> put there -LRB- to advise citizens on gun registration -RRB-,'' <PERSON> Raoul </PERSON> <PERSON> Carroll </PERSON>, <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON>'s attorney, argued during the trial. `` He was entirely at the mercy of the <LOCATION> District </LOCATION> <LOCATION> of </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>.'' One juror who declined to reveal his name said that `` wrong information was given to <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON> <PERSON> Jr. </PERSON> and <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON> Sr.'' by authorities. <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON>, who is black, testified that he obtained the weapon from his son in 1982 after receiving a series of death threats from people purporting to be members of the <ORGANIZATION> Ku </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klux </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Klan </ORGANIZATION>. He said his fears were compounded by frequent intrusions by teen-agers who held late-night pool parties, usually with alcohol and drugs, in his yard. Prosecutors contended, however, that <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON> was not authorized to handle a weapon not registered to him. `` We are here simply because the handgun is not registered,'' prosecutor <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> C. </PERSON> <PERSON> Collier </PERSON> told the court. `` The death threats, the shooting and the issue of trespassing have nothing to do with this case.'' Police officers who investigated the shooting testified that a door at the rear of <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON>'s home showed signs that someone had tried to break in. One officer also said <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> had been shot at close range just outside the home. <PERSON> Rowan </PERSON> maintained that he shot <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> because he was afraid the intruder was trying to enter the house.

 The legislature and the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION>'s policy-making body will shake up the <LOCATION> Kremlin </LOCATION> hierarchy in extraordinary meetings this week, a high-level source said Thursday The policy-setting <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> meets Friday and the Supreme Soviet on Saturday. The meetings brought officials rushing back to <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> and sparked speculation that Soviet leader <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and his opponents would face off over his ambitious economic and social reforms. Soviet sources said there was `` no crisis'' in the leadership, but the abrupt change in plans of several top Kremlin figures clearly indicated urgent or unexpected business. <ORGANIZATION> Tass </ORGANIZATION> reported Foreign Minister <PERSON> Eduard </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Shevardnadze </PERSON> landed in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> Thursday afternoon after cutting short a <ORGANIZATION> U.N. </ORGANIZATION> visit. Defense Minister <PERSON> Dmitri </PERSON> <PERSON> T. </PERSON> <PERSON> Yazov </PERSON> ended a visit to <LOCATION> India </LOCATION> a day ahead of schedule. The 1,500-member Supreme Soviet, the nation's parliament, usually convenes twice a year after meetings of the 300-member Central Committee. It last met May 24-26. Soviet media reported Sunday that a regular session of the Supreme Soviet would begin Oct. 27, and the announcement Thursday of a special sitting at such short notice was highly unusual. The <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> had been expected to meet by the end of October, but one Soviet source said plans for implementing <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s political reforms were proceeding `` faster than was expected.'' The source, a member of the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> staff, said the committee will approve changes in the party and the structure of government outlined at a party conference in June. The reforms are intended to enhance the status of the party as the leading force in Soviet society. The source called it `` logical'' that personnel changes would follow any change in the organizations' format. He spoke on condition of anonymity. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration officials disclosed that diplomats in several foreign countries were told one personnel change might be the elevation of Marshal <PERSON> Sergei </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Akhromeyev </PERSON> to a position of special assistant to <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>. <PERSON> Akhromeyev </PERSON> is the chief of the general staff _ a position equal to that of chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Joint </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Chiefs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Staff </ORGANIZATION> _ and the No. 2 military officer in the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> behind the defense minister. The officials, who demanded anonymity, said the administration had yet to verify the reports independently. At its last meeting July 29, the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> adopted a timetable for overhauling the Soviet political system, which also was discussed at the party conference. That blueprint calls for a new, full-time legislature and a more powerful president, a post <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> could take on. The first deadline set was October, by which time the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> said a draft law on amendments to the Soviet Constitution and on multicandidate elections of legislators was to be complete. In a Sept. 23 speech, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> said the party's 13-member Politburo would convene soon to review the draft law. <ORGANIZATION> Foreign </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Vadim </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Perfiliev </PERSON> told a government news briefing Thursday that the <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> plenum `` will mark another step in realizing the decisions'' of the last party conference. The <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> source put the focus on changes in the party's structure. Soviet sources also reported speculation among high-placed officials about possible changes on the Politburo itself, indicating uncertainty even at high levels about the agenda. The <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> is empowered to make personnel changes in the Politburo, the party's ruling body. The last full Politburo member removed was <PERSON> Geidar </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Aliev </PERSON> on Oct. 21, 1987. <PERSON> Aliev </PERSON> was a protege of former President <PERSON> Leonid </PERSON> <PERSON> I. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON>, who now is harshly criticized for permitting corruption and stagnation. The conference of 5,000 <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> officials held in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> three months ago approved plans to limit terms of <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> officials and a review of the party's 20 million members. At that session, one delegate criticized by name President <PERSON> Andrei </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gromyko </PERSON>, 79, and fellow Politburo member <PERSON> Mikhail </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Solomentsev </PERSON>, 75, linking them to the abuses of the <PERSON> Brezhnev </PERSON> era. Some observers speculate that <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON>'s backers want to remove 60 to 70 Central Committee members. <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> repeatedly has criticized the party apparatus for being too involved in daily government operations and argues that the party should focus on broad policies and theories. Personnel changes could give <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> and his backers a chance to move out conservative party bureaucrats they see blocking the Soviet leader's reforms. In a speech Wednesday, <PERSON> Gorbachev </PERSON> again pressed the case for sweeping reforms. `` Any of the current burning problems underscores the necessity of radical change,'' he said.

 <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> was thrown out of office six months ago, but the former <LOCATION> Arizona </LOCATION> governor remains a defiant political force whose supporters have shown strength at the polls and whose thoughts of a possible gubernatorial challenge in 1990 remain alive. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> says he is doing fine and feels he is winning his war against the political establishment. `` It does n't bother me at all not to be there -LRB- in the governor's office -RRB-,'' he said in an interview Besides weighing a run two years from now for the governorship, he said he is still considering a federal court appeal of his impeachment conviction. The April 4 removal of <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, a Republican, by the state <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> put a Democrat, <PERSON> Rose </PERSON> <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON>, in the governor's chair and began a period of political turmoil that some politicians say could reverberate for years. In a bitter <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> primary Sept. 13, <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Kunasek </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Speaker <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Lane </PERSON> lost their seats to <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> backers. Seven other incumbent lawmakers also were defeated. `` The <ORGANIZATION> Republican </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> is devastated,'' said <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> Minority Leader <PERSON> Alan </PERSON> <PERSON> Stephens </PERSON>, who hopes his Democrats can capitalize on the troubles to take over the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> in the Nov. 8 election. Although <PERSON> Meacham </PERSON> insists he is not motivated by a thirst for revenge against the lawmakers who voted to impeach or convict him, he has predicted a `` revolution at the ballot box'' this fall that would turn many incumbents out of office. The ex-governor formed a group that has provided advice and literature to <ORGANIZATION> GOP </ORGANIZATION> candidates who backed him. But among those who lost their primaries, according to <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Minority Leader <PERSON> Art </PERSON> <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON>, a Democrat, were many Republicans who tried to accommodate <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s policies early in his governorship. `` The fact of the matter is the <LOCATION> Mecham </LOCATION> forces do not accept 95 percent support, 99 percent support,'' <PERSON> Hamilton </PERSON> said. `` Either you live and die with him all the way or they try to see that you die.'' `` It is n't a matter of getting even,'' <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> said, but one of seeing the <ORGANIZATION> Legislature </ORGANIZATION> `` controlled by the people instead of the power brokers.'' `` Whether I'm in the office or not is n't the most important thing in the world,'' he said. `` I have no real regrets.'' Many of the legislators who removed <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> after 15 months in office say they do n't have any regrets either. `` I would vote the same way, even knowing what was coming,'' said <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> Judiciary Chairman <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Skelly </PERSON>, a Republican who headed the impeachment committee. `` Philosophically, I liked what he was trying to do, namely stop state spending,'' said <PERSON> Skelly </PERSON>, like <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> a strong conservative. But he added that the impeachment evidence against <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> was `` absolutely overwhelming.'' `` Let us not forget the chaos that existed when he was governor,'' <PERSON> Stephens </PERSON> added. `` The state was going down the tubes quickly. If I had it to do over again I'd convict him again.'' <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> was convicted of misusing $ 80,000 from a special `` protocol fund'' by loaning it to his auto dealership, and of trying to thwart an investigation of an alleged death threat. The fund was created through private donations to a <LOCATION> Mecham </LOCATION> inaugural committee and was subsequently pledged for protocol purposes, such as buying gifts for visiting dignitaries. Gov. Mofford and Attorney General <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Corbin </PERSON> have filed a civil suit seeking to force <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> to turn the protocol fund over to the state. <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>, still maintaining it is n't public money, tried to return it to those who donated it. A bank refused to honor the checks, however, till the legal issue was settled. The impeachment conviction itself was the finale to a governorship in which he was accused of appointing incompetent cronies to state jobs and of making statements offensive to women, blacks, Jews, homosexuals and the Japanese. In June, however, <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> was acquitted in criminal court on six felony charges of concealing a $ 350,000 campaign loan _ a verdict he considered a major vindication. That trial required stronger proof than the `` clear and convincing evidence'' required for the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> conviction. The conviction propelled Mrs. <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON>, the popular longtime secretary of <ORGANIZATION> state </ORGANIZATION>, into the governor's chair, and she has been widely credited with returning stability and competence to state government. <PERSON> Lane </PERSON>, the defeated <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> speaker, said one of the former governor's main problems was that he refused to work with the Legislature. But <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> appointee <PERSON> Max </PERSON> <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON> insisted that the governor `` leaned over backwards to work with them.'' <PERSON> Hawkins </PERSON> still contends there was no valid reason for the impeachment. `` There was a faction in the Republican party that was vehemently opposed to <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>,'' said <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>'s former press secretary, <PERSON> Ron </PERSON> <PERSON> Bellus </PERSON>. `` It was very deep and very mean and very angry. That group was out to discredit and destroy <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON> at any cost.'' The new governor wishes the political turmoil would quiet down. `` I have a good feeling out there with the public. We can not wave a magic wand here and solve all of the problems, but we're facing them,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Mofford </PERSON> said. `` I think too much attention is focused on <PERSON> Evan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mecham </PERSON>.''

<HEAD>Echoes of World War II Still Heard at Guadalcanal</HEAD>

<DATELINE>GUADALCANAL, Solomon Islands (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Echoes of one of World War II's most famous battles still reverberate through the jungles of <LOCATION> Guadalcanal </LOCATION> as Australian army demolition experts detonate a huge stock of Japanese and American ammunition that litters the old battlefield. Occasionally, the war claims another casualty when <LOCATION> Solomon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> fishermen are killed trying to pry open the rusting artillery shells to get the explosives, which they use to stun fish. At <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Joseph </ORGANIZATION>'s school, the students have been warned to stop their favorite game of throwing old mortar bombs into a fire, then running away to hide behind a tree to await the explosion. The Australians are committed to clearing the explosives from 22 acres of jungle down to a depth of 10 feet, at a place called Hell's Point about five miles from <LOCATION> Honiara </LOCATION>, capital of the Solomons. `` It's a five-year program,'' said Sgt. <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> Mansell </PERSON>, `` and when we've finished there's another area on the sea side of <LOCATION> Henderson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Field </LOCATION> that will take about 10 years.'' <LOCATION> Henderson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Field </LOCATION>, now the main airport for <LOCATION> Honiara </LOCATION>, was the focal point of a <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Marine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corps </ORGANIZATION> landing on Aug. 7, 1942, that became one of the bloodiest battles of the war. When the Japanese finally withdrew six months later, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had lost 1,600 killed and 4,200 wounded. The Japanese losses are estimated to have been 15,000 killed. `` When the Americans left at the end of the war, they attempted to blow up their ammunition dumps,'' said <PERSON> Mansell </PERSON>. `` What they succeeded in doing was to scatter live ammunition all over the area like confetti. `` There are probably a million rounds of 105mm howitzer shells, mortars and grenades. We collected 2,000 rounds in one day.'' The Australians, assisted by the <LOCATION> Solomon </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Islands </LOCATION> police, slash the head-high kunai grass to the ground, clear the area of shells lying on the surface, then use metal detectors to find buried ammunition. They stack the shells in piles, attach plastic explosives to them and detonate them from a bunker 500 yards away. They first warn the control tower at <LOCATION> Henderson </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Field </LOCATION> in case a plane is overhead. The shrapnel slices through the jungle and into the sky for more than 1,000 feet. `` It can be tricky,'' said <PERSON> Mansell </PERSON>. `` The whole area is surrounded by a minefield, and we've got to clear that, too.'' As well as saving the lives of unsuspecting islanders, the cleanup will end a profitable sideline for islanders who chisel brass rings off the base of the shells to sell for scrap. Some have been killed doing it. Tourists have been stopped boarding planes carrying live World War II ammunition, bought as souvenirs. The principal at <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Joseph </LOCATION><LOCATION> 's </LOCATION>, where the building rattles daily from the detonations, will lose his supply of shrapnel pieces which he sells to tourists for 20 cents each to raise funds for the school.

<HEAD>Researchers Find Japanese Produced Banned Chemical Weapons in
1930s-40s</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 Japanese researchers are unearthing a steady flow of evidence of their country's production of banned chemical weapons and macabre germ-warfare experiments after it annexed <LOCATION> Manchuria </LOCATION> in 1932 and throughout World War II. Critics here say the government has yet to fully address the Japanese role in the use of toxic gases up to the end of World War II in 1945 or acknowledge the grisly experiments conducted by the Japanese army's notorious Unit 731 in <LOCATION> Manchuria </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Hisashi </PERSON> <PERSON> Yamanaka </PERSON>, writer and collector of war documents, said he has discovered official reports indicating that the Japanese military planned wide distribution of poison-gas weapons in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>, in violation of international treaties <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> had signed after World War I and in 1925. <PERSON> Yamanaka </PERSON>, pointing to pamphlets yellowed with age and stamped `` Top Secret,'' said, `` These are the most detailed, official accounts of Japanese military deeds uncovered up until now.'' The Japanese government has never denied the existence of the germ warfare unit or use of gas weapons by the <ORGANIZATION> Japanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Imperial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Army </ORGANIZATION>. But officials maintain there is insufficient evidence to determine the extent of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s involvement with gas and germ weapons because all documents were destroyed at the end of the war. <PERSON> Yamanaka </PERSON>, 57, whose rummaging through old-book stores paid off last year, said his find shows not everyone followed military orders to burn their records. `` <PERSON> Riichi </PERSON> <PERSON> Naito </PERSON>, who served as an assistant to Lt. Gen. <PERSON> Shiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Ishii </PERSON>, head of Unit 731, kept his records. After he passed away, relatives unknowingly sold off his books,'' <PERSON> Yamanaka </PERSON> said in an interview at his suburban home in <LOCATION> Fujisawa </LOCATION>. He said the documents state that Unit 731, based in <LOCATION> Harbin </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Manchuria </LOCATION>, had spread out to encompass 26 experimental centers around <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> by 1940 and employed more than 10,000 people. They also state that the unit was experimenting in methods of growing disease-producing organisms and preparing vaccines and that it conducted bacteriological tests on prisoners of war. <PERSON> Yamanaka </PERSON> said that when he found the reports last year, he thought they dealt with something else, and so it was only this year that he re-examined them. <ORGANIZATION> Nagasaki </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Keiichi </PERSON> <PERSON> Tsuneishi </PERSON>, a specialist in the history of science, verified <PERSON> Yamanaka </PERSON>'s documents and made the results public at an international conference in <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, in August. Though news reports from the <LOCATION> San </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Diego </LOCATION> meeting were widely published in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Yamanaka </PERSON> said he doubts that those and other revelations would bring a government response to allegations of wartime excesses. `` It would make <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> look evil,'' he said. `` Moreover, there is always the possibility that research is still continuing today and they -LRB- the government -RRB- want to keep it confidential.'' The government, however, officially opposes chemical weapons, and it welcomed President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s speech Sept. 26 to the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> General </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Assembly </ORGANIZATION> calling for a chemical-weapons ban `` on a verifiable and global basis.'' <PERSON> Tsuneishi </PERSON> said Unit 731 researchers injected Chinese and Soviet prisoners with typhus, cholera and a variety of other germs; induced gangrene, did live dissections and froze victims to death in endurance tests. After the war, <PERSON> Ishii </PERSON>, the head of Unit 731, was questioned by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> occupation authorities but was n't prosecuted. <PERSON> Tsuneishi </PERSON> and others maintain that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> gave immunity to such Japanese researchers in exchange for their data, because the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> had only begun gas and germ warfare research in 1944 and wanted to gain headway in the field. On the small island of <LOCATION> Okuno </LOCATION> in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s <LOCATION> Inland </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Hatsuichi </PERSON> <PERSON> Murakami </PERSON>, 62, opened a small museum in July _ as testimony to the Japanese workers in the secret chemical weapons factory there. `` The residents of <PERSON> Okuno </PERSON> decided to open this museum to teach others that chemical weapons are an outrage against humanity,'' <PERSON> Murakami </PERSON> said in a raspy voice. He, like many of his surviving co-workers, suffers from respiratory illness, a legacy of the five years he worked in the chemical factory from 1940. The military in 1939 deleted <PERSON> Okuno </PERSON> from Japanese maps to keep its chemical-weapons factory a secret. The island, near <LOCATION> Hiroshima </LOCATION>, is about 400 miles southwest of <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. The factory produced mustard gas, lewisite, nausea gas and hydrocyanic acid gas for use against <LOCATION> China </LOCATION>. `` We produced some 1,200 tons annually during the peak years from 1940-43,'' <PERSON> Murakami </PERSON> said in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Ocuna </LOCATION>. `` There were healthy people when I went in, young girls and boys, but we had to work long hours and the level of gas sometimes reached danger levels,'' Allied forces destroyed the factory in 1945. In mid-September many newspapers again carried news stories reporting research by <PERSON> Yuki </PERSON> <PERSON> Tanaka </PERSON>, a Japanese teaching in <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION>, on people who worked in the <PERSON> Okuno </PERSON> island factory. A separate document released by <PERSON> Yamanaka </PERSON> and reported widely in the Japanese press in September outlined military plans to distribute gas weapons in <LOCATION> China </LOCATION> during the height of the Japanese military offensive in 1938. Since 1981 reports have trickled out from <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> and Japanese researchers about World War II germ-such material in school textbooks has become a controversial one in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. But the <ORGANIZATION> Education </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, which has final say on content of textbooks, contends the evidence is n't conclusive.

<HEAD>River Phoenix and His Unique Family</HEAD>

<DATELINE>LOS ANGELES (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The unique nature of the <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> family was recently related by young actor <LOCATION> River </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION>. `` I was born in <LOCATION> Oregon </LOCATION>, my sister, Rain, was born in <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>, my brother, <PERSON> Joaquin </PERSON> <PERSON> Rafael </PERSON>, alias Leaf, was born in <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION>, my other sister, Liberty, is a native of <LOCATION> Venezuela </LOCATION>, my other sister, Summer, was born in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>, my mother in the <LOCATION> Bronx </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, my father in <LOCATION> Fontana </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif </LOCATION>,'' he said. River, who just turned 18, added: `` Since I was 10, we have been based in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>. We moved frequently from home to home in <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, never owned a house. Sometimes we moved because our financial condition was weakening and we needed a more affordable place. Sometimes we moved because we recently got a part which allowed us to get above the unpleasant conditions we were in.'' Arlynn and <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Phoenix </PERSON> worked odd jobs and lived the free-spirited lifestyle of the 1960s. They were noncomformists and loved nature. Today, they write and lecture on environmentalism and work as farmers in <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION>. Besides River, Leaf, 13, is an actor. The other children also have done a little acting. The Phoenix family offers an uncanny parallel to the Pope family in the current <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bros. </ORGANIZATION> release, `` Running on Empty,'' which stars <PERSON> Christine </PERSON> <PERSON> Lahti </PERSON>, <PERSON> Judd </PERSON> <PERSON> Hirsch </PERSON> and River. Both families are environmental activists and nontraditionalists. But there is an important difference: the Popes, husband, wife and two sons, are on the lam. During the turbulent 1960s, the parents bombed a napalm laboratory, inadvertently blinding a janitor. The Popes have been on the <ORGANIZATION> FBI </ORGANIZATION>'s most-wanted list ever since. `` We were a little different from the motives behind the Pope family and why they moved,'' <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> said. `` Obviously, they were moving because they had to for survival.'' According to family legend, <PERSON> River </PERSON> began his performing career at the age of five on the streets of <LOCATION> Caracas </LOCATION>, singing with his sister, Rainbow, then three. When the family made the move to <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, he began getting television work, making his film debut in the 1985 `` Explorers.'' His naturalness and dramatic intensity impressed critics and young fans alike in `` Stand by Me,'' `` The Mosquito Coast,'' `` A Night in the Life of <PERSON> Jimmy </PERSON> <PERSON> Reardon </PERSON> and `` Little Nikita.'' <PERSON> Sidney </PERSON> <PERSON> Lumet </PERSON>, who directed him in `` Running on Empty,'' said <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> is in the transitional period between child and adult actor: `` He has a surprising technique that he has developed on his own; he has never studied acting. `` But he'll make the adjustment -LRB- to adulthood -RRB-. ... He can play a couple more teen-agers, but then _ who knows? He's a very talented musician and writes beautiful songs. He's one of those people who's so talented I do n't know where he's going to go. The world is open to him.'' <LOCATION> Phoenix </LOCATION> views his peripatetic childhood as an asset to him as an actor. `` I think it helps you become versatile in adapting to new situations, new atmospheres, new people, just as you do when you go from film to film,'' he said. `` It also gives you an insight on different forms of life and different perspectives.'' In facing new schools and new neighborhoods, he added, `` you learn to blend in and to simulate what the others are doing and apply that to your reality around them. By your doing so, they will take you in. Without conforming and without compromising your individuality, there is a way of being neutral and not running things the wrong way.'' How does he see his future in films _ or does he just take one year at a time? `` Even one year at a time is too long a time span for me to foresee. I'm very happy with what I'm doing, very aware and open to changes, will accept them gladly when they come,'' he said. `` By all means I am not tied down, nor do I feel the need, nor is my security or my ego riding on this career. `` If anything, I would rather quit while I was ahead. I would n't try to keep an old car plugging away if it's not working anymore I'd just get into another business or use that time to travel. We'll see how it all happens. I think a lot of it is in how you pace yourself, not spreading yourself too thin,'' he said. `` Every bit of it is a learning process. If I'm taking parts that teach me to act out these cliche forms of writing and to live these little molds because they're commercially successful, it strips you of any unique flavor that you might have within yourself.''

<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> WILKES-BARRE </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pa. </LOCATION> -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> AP </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- _ <PERSON> Euterpe </PERSON> <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is awake at 2:30 one recent Friday morning, too excited for sleep. At age 85, she is ready for another campaign trip on behalf of her son, <PERSON> Michael </PERSON>, who is running for president. Her mostly elderly audiences marvel at the energy that propels her through the once rich anthracite coal country of eastern <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>. From <LOCATION> Wilkes-Barre </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> Scranton </LOCATION> to <PERSON> Olyphant </PERSON> to <LOCATION> Allentown </LOCATION>, Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> and four campaign workers drive past slack piles and fields of morning glories. With only three hours sleep, she naps when she can. Before the day is over, she will speak at four events, pose for souvenir photos with well-wishers and give brief interviews to a dozen reporters. She will work the crowds, clasping hands and often speaking in her native tongue to Greek-Americans. She talks of her immigration to the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> from <LOCATION> Larissa </LOCATION> in northern <LOCATION> Greece </LOCATION> with her parents and three sisters when she was 9 years old. `` We came to my older brother who came first when he was 18 years old and settled here. This is the story of all immigrant families. Then he brought my younger brother and the two together were able to bring the whole family,'' she says. `` I do n't know where she gets the energy at that age to give one speech and go on to another,'' says <PERSON> Jule </PERSON> <PERSON> Dobrowski </PERSON>, 70, who was among 200 elderly residents who heard Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> speak at the <ORGANIZATION> Lackawanna </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Health </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Care </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Center </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Olyphant </LOCATION>. `` I come from strong mountain people,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said in an interview en route from one stop to another. `` Maybe that's one thing. My grandmother died at 95. My great-grandmother died when she was 105. I have a long way to go yet ... This campaign has really gave me a great infusion of energy.'' She has traveled to two dozen states, some more than once, from <LOCATION> East </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Coast </LOCATION>, in the more than a year she has been drumming up votes for her son, the Democratic presidential nominee. She averages three days a week on the campaign trail. She looks like the <LOCATION> Old </LOCATION> <LOCATION> World </LOCATION> mother that she is, a plain woman, short white-grayish hair, glasses, simple black skirt, peach colored blouse, red jacket. As a matter of fact, only the Sunday before this trip, her son went to her house, not for political advice, which she never gives him, but for breakfast. She made blueberry muffins for him, which he enjoyed, then filled a box for him to take home to his wife, <PERSON> Kitty </PERSON>. `` She's a regular mother,'' says <PERSON> Mary </PERSON> <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION> delegate for <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> at the Democratic national convention last July. `` She's a person you can relate to. She's a real person.'' Matronly in dress and simple in speech, she is spunky in defending her son against attacks from the Republicans including his opponent, Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, and President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>. `` They're not true,'' she said. What particulary hurt her was <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s reference last August to her son as an invalid in response to <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' denial that he had ever undergone psychiatric treatment. The president said later he was joking. `` <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> had lost his brother in a terrible accident and he also lost the election and he was depressed,'' Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON>' older brother, <PERSON> Stelian </PERSON>, who was beset by mental problems, died in 1973 when he was struck by a hit-and-run driver while riding his bike. To this day the driver has not been caught. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> lost in his bid for a second term as governor in the 1978 primary election but won back the office four years later. Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> is no different than most parents when it comes to bragging about her son. `` <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> has been my joy from the time he was born,'' she told 200 people at the Wilkes-Barre Senior Citizens Center. `` He was a very easy child to bring up. He loved life. He loved everything that he did. He loved people and he has continued to and that is why he is in politics.'' Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> says she loves campaigning and was disappointed when she was grounded for a time in August because of laryngitis and a bad cough. `` I love meeting people. My son gets it from me, I guess.'' She shows her enthusiasm after a luncheon of chicken and rice in <LOCATION> Scranton </LOCATION> with local supporters. `` Too bad we could n't push the tables to the wall and start dancing,'' she tells them as she hurries to the next stop. `` Another time.'' They laugh and applaud. But it is not all laughter. Even though Mrs. <PERSON> Dukakis </PERSON> says she's never had one unhappy moment on the campaign trail, small groups of anti-abortion demonstrators dog her wherever she goes with signs saying things like, `` We welcome you more than your son will welcome the unborn. Aides try to steer her out of sight of them. `` <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> is pro-life,'' she says. `` But he's not the same pro-life that they are. It is n't that he's for abortion but since it exists, let a woman make her own choice according to her religion or her sense of morals.'' At the end of this day, she has a 7 p.m. flight to catch at <LOCATION> Allentown </LOCATION> airport. She wants to get home before 10. `` I want to see <PERSON> Kitty </PERSON> on TV with <PERSON> Barbara </PERSON> <PERSON> Walters </PERSON>. This is an important night, sir.'' But the flight is an hour late late because of thunderstorms. She sits in the airport lounge watching her son on the television news. Finally, she is airborne and arrives back home in <LOCATION> Brookline </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mass. </LOCATION>, just moments before 10.

<TEXT>
 Nearly 50 years after the <PERSON> Joad </PERSON> family made that memorable trek from dry and dusty <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> to the fertile farmlands of <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, `` The Grapes of Wrath'' has made a new journey from page to stage. It's not the first theater adaptation of the Pulitzer Prize-winning novel by <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinbeck </PERSON>, but the <ORGANIZATION> Steppenwolf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Theater </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION> production at the Royal-George Theater, which closes Oct. 30, is certainly the most expensive. The $ 500,000 project also has the enthusiastic support of <PERSON> Elaine </PERSON> <PERSON> Steinbeck </PERSON>, the author's widow. The play stars two of the <LOCATION> Steppenwolf </LOCATION> troupe's biggest names, <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Sinise </PERSON> and <PERSON> Terry </PERSON> <PERSON> Kinney </PERSON>, as well as guest artist <PERSON> Lois </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> as the indomitable <PERSON> Ma </PERSON> <PERSON> Joad </PERSON>. <ORGANIZATION> AT </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; T picked up part of the tab for the three-hour production which has a cast of 41, including four musicians who play an original score by <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>. They perform on a spare, wooden-plank setting designed by <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Rigdon </PERSON>, who also did the costumes and lighting. The rough-hewn set covers the floor and back wall of the large stage. But the man most responsible for the play, as well as its direction, is <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Galati </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> jack of all-theatrical trades who acts, writes, directs and teaches. The 44-year-old <PERSON> Galati </PERSON> first read `` The Grapes of Wrath'' in high school. `` It affected me in a number of ways that I've only begun to understand in the last couple of years,'' he said. `` It turned me in the direction of literature, and my whole academic life as a student and as a teacher has been involved in the study of fiction.'' <PERSON> Galati </PERSON> began adapting novels for the stage as a teacher at <ORGANIZATION> Northwestern </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>, where he directed a summer program that took students through the process. One novel he wanted to adapt was `` The Grapes of Wrath,'' but he could n't get the rights. The idea lay dormant until <PERSON> Sinise </PERSON>, at the time <LOCATION> Steppenwolf </LOCATION>'s artistic director, invited <PERSON> Galati </PERSON> to submit suggestions for possible productions. `` I thought ` The Grapes of Wrath' would offer wonderful opportunities for an ensemble of exceptional actors,'' <PERSON> Galati </PERSON> said. <PERSON> Sinise </PERSON>, who had had some success with a production of <PERSON> Steinbeck </PERSON>'s `` Of Mice and Men'' a few years earlier, agreed The <PERSON> Steinbeck </PERSON> estate, after extended negotiations, granted permission. By January of this year, <PERSON> Galati </PERSON> had done two drafts and began a third version after <PERSON> Randall </PERSON> <PERSON> Arney </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Steppenwolf </LOCATION>'s artistic director and <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Eich </PERSON>, its managing director, decided to open the company's fall season with the work. How does one boil down a sprawling novel of 30 chapters and nearly 600 pages? <PERSON> Galati </PERSON> started with a careful rereading. `` I needed to see the flow of the book,'' he said, `` particularly, those incidents and episodes and characters that come to the surface as tent poles, a kind of spine on which the rest of the action hangs.'' The novel, <PERSON> Galati </PERSON> says, is kind of an American ballad, and poses particular problems for a dramatist. `` On stage you're stuck with having to get a truck full of 13 people from <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION> by moving it a few feet,'' he said. `` That compression, and telescoping and distortion of time and space is a very significant problem. `` The book has an A-B, <ORGANIZATION> A-B </ORGANIZATION> form of alternating chapters that go from the general to the specific. <PERSON> Steinbeck </PERSON> does a kind of landscape painting. Voice by voice, you get the sense of the great numbers of characters who are part of the epoch he was reflecting _ the migrant workers, the land bosses, the contractors, the labor organizers, the businessmen. You also get a panorama of the Dust Bowl _ Highway 66 from <LOCATION> Oklahoma </LOCATION> to <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>.'' These broad scenes alternate with the stories of the <PERSON> Joad </PERSON> family, their immediate concerns and the characters they meet. `` <PERSON> Steinbeck </PERSON> had a remarkable way, and very experimental for its time, of letting scenes take their own natural time,'' <PERSON> Galati </PERSON> said. `` People in the novel do n't come to conclusions quickly. There are some cataclysmic scenes and events, of course, but very often dialogue and rhetoric move at a leisurely pace which I was interested in retaining without sacrificing the need for urgency in the drama.'' <PERSON> Galati </PERSON> needed to find a framework to dramatize the more general chapters. He found his answer in music. `` I contacted <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, a wonderful <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> composer and folk singer, and gave him sections of the novel that I had condensed into lyrics and asked him to set those lyrics to music which he did over the course of the summer,'' <PERSON> Galati </PERSON> says. Have their efforts paid off? The major <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> reviews were divided about the show's merits. In the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sun-Times </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Hedy </PERSON> <PERSON> Weiss </PERSON> called the production `` breathtaking and emotionally wrenching ... it would be an unpardonable sin if it did not receive an extended life, both in this country and abroad.'' Although the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribune </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Christiansen </PERSON> described the play as `` reverent'' and `` ambitious,'' he said `` admiration for its effort must give way to disappointment in its results.'' <PERSON> Galati </PERSON> feels `` The Grapes of Wrath,'' both as a novel and a stage play, holds a particular relevance for people in 1988. `` There is this uncanny coincidence of the summer drought devastating American agriculture,'' he says. `` And there's the theme of literally sacrificing the land, abusing and destroying the environment for the sake of capital gains. And we've still got migrant workers as the lowest rung of the social and economic ladder. Those themes remain as resonant today as they were in 1939.''

 Despite grim predictions, the city escaped economic disaster following the 1987 stock market crash and made a `` relatively soft landing,'' officials and economic experts say. Though the financial sector was hit with layoffs and the city responded with budgetary belt tightening in the form of a hiring freeze and tax increases, worst-case scenarios never materialized. `` This was the year that everyone predicted would be a downer,'' said <PERSON> Samuel </PERSON> <PERSON> Ehrenhalt </PERSON>, regional commissioner of the federal <ORGANIZATION> Bureau </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Labor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Statistics </ORGANIZATION>. `` But the city's economy did not go over the cliff.'' <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Dickstein </PERSON>, director of the city's <ORGANIZATION> Office </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Budget </ORGANIZATION>, agrees the crash did not bring on the economic disaster predicted by some, but he said, `` We've paid for it ... and will continue paying for it.'' <PERSON> Dickstein </PERSON> cited the 6,000 jobs left vacant as a result of the three-month hiring freeze and another 5,827 positions eliminated under a subsequent reduction program aimed at saving $ 270 million. Officials were also forced to raise property taxes and to eliminate an energy tax break for businesses. The object: to raise $ 115 million to make up part of a projected $ 300 million in lost tax and sales revenues. Though the city's economy remains `` basically healthy,'' <PERSON> Dickstein </PERSON> said, `` Things are going to be much tighter for the next few years than it has been in some time.'' `` We had been experiencing an unprecedented boom for a long period of time'' because of the pre-crash bull market, <PERSON> Dickstein </PERSON> said. `` We have to recognize that that's over and, therefore, city expenditures have to be moderated.'' `` After all, that was the most important industry in this town,'' he said. `` Every town has one and ours was financial services, and still is. You would expect then if your most important industry is in the midst of shrinking _ jobs and revenue _ that your tax revenues will decline with it.'' For city residents, evidence of the crash of'87 will be seen in the form of dirtier streets due to a smaller sanitation staff; shorter library hours; more potholes; a police force whose ranks are frozen. `` It's clear that <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION> is in a very different -LRB- economic -RRB- environment now,'' <PERSON> Ehrenhalt </PERSON> said. `` But on the whole, if you consider the projections that had been made, this is a relatively soft landing.'' <PERSON> Ehrenhalt </PERSON> said one analyst predicted 70,000 jobs would be lost, 20,000 of them on Wall Street alone. In reality, unemployment in the city for the first half of 1988 was at a 19-year low of 4 percent, according to <PERSON> Ehrenhalt </PERSON>, and there was a net decline of 12,000 jobs in the financial sector and another 3,000 in banking. Those losses were offset by a gain of 16,000 jobs in the service sector, which includes the legal profession, advertising, health care and educational services. `` Normal growth for the city is about 1.8 percent to 2 percent. So 1 percent after the crash is very good,'' said <PERSON> Rae </PERSON> <PERSON> Rosen </PERSON>, an economist for the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Home </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Loan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION>. Predictions that other industries would feel tremors after the crash did n't prove true, either. The hotel and restaurant industry emerged virtually unscathed, thanks largely to the devalued <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar, which has made <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> `` a bargain hunter's paradise'' for foreigners, <PERSON> Ehrenhalt </PERSON> said. The construction industry `` has held up well, though it's not as strong as it was last year,'' <PERSON> Ehrenhalt </PERSON> said. And the real estate industry survived predictions that property values would plunge as panicked executives unloaded condominiums and suburban estates. `` I think most people held off looking -LRB- at properties -RRB- in the first few months to see what would happen,'' said <PERSON> Steven </PERSON> <PERSON> Spinola </PERSON>, head of the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Real </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Estate </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION>. `` We've now got a healthier residential market than before.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Corcoran </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>, which specializes in luxury residential sales, reported that the average price of a two-bedroom apartment in <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> rose 3.25 percent in August to $ 489,400. <PERSON> Spinola </PERSON> said office vacancy rates, up about 13 percent, are `` higher than we'd like'' but even that market remains relatively strong. <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Purcell </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> Stamford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Realtors </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Connecticut </LOCATION>, said big-ticket estates, those in the $ 900,000 to $ 2 million range, may have stayed on the market longer than usual, but overall `` sales are equally as good as they've been in other years.'' Though some complained the real estate market was soft, Ms. <PERSON> Rosen </PERSON> said it was `` only in the sense that people are no longer getting 20 percent gains in prices each year ... The gains are closer to 5 percent, which is a more normal market.'' `` It's been a surprising year,'' said <PERSON> Ehrenhalt </PERSON>.

<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>, who gave cable TV its first superstation, launches his latest broadcasting venture Monday night with the debut of <ORGANIZATION> Turner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Television </ORGANIZATION>, the new home of <PERSON> Scarlett </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Hara </PERSON> and Miss Piggy. At first, <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> will build TNT with films from his billion-dollar film library, led off Monday by `` Gone With The Wind,'' his favorite movie. On Tuesday, Muppet creator <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Henson </PERSON>'s popular `` Fraggle Rock'' show moves from Home Box Office to TNT. `` The Muppet Show,'' with Miss Piggy and <PERSON> Kermit </PERSON> the Frog, will follow that afternoon and <PERSON> Henson </PERSON> has signed on for other projects. Although early on the 24-hour network will make liberal use of cartoons in the daytime and movies at night, <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> promises one major project a week by 1991: already scheduled are made-for-TNT movies starring <PERSON> Martin </PERSON> <PERSON> Sheen </PERSON> and son <PERSON> Emilio </PERSON> <PERSON> Estevez </PERSON>, <PERSON> Farrah </PERSON> <PERSON> Fawcett </PERSON> and Oscar-winners <PERSON> Charlton </PERSON> <PERSON> Heston </PERSON> and <PERSON> Faye </PERSON> <PERSON> Dunaway </PERSON>. <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>, owner of <ORGANIZATION> Cable </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> News </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> CNN </ORGANIZATION> Headline News, also promises to bid on major award shows, sporting events including the Olympics and major league baseball, and other showcase programs. Turner executives say 17 million homes will be able to get TNT initially. `` It's far less important what they launch with than how quickly they get into 30 million homes,'' said industry analyst <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerbrandt </PERSON>. `` I think they need to reach 30 million within ... 18 to 24 months to keep to their business plan, and actually they'd like to do it sooner than that.'' By reaching 30 million, <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>'s contract with the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Basketball </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> will allow him to move a regular schedule of pro basketball games _ featuring all the <ORGANIZATION> NBA </ORGANIZATION> teams, not just <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>'s own <ORGANIZATION> Atlanta </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hawks </ORGANIZATION> _ from SuperStation TBS to <ORGANIZATION> TNT </ORGANIZATION>. That, <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> said, will free him to show more Hawks games on TBS. <ORGANIZATION> TNT </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman <PERSON> Allison </PERSON> <PERSON> Berry </PERSON> said early projections had TNT in 30 million homes by the end of 1989 or early 1990, but the increase in initial contracts may move that to earlier in 1989. <PERSON> Gerbrandt </PERSON> and other analysts suggest <ORGANIZATION> TNT </ORGANIZATION> is the next step in cable programming. `` TNT creates a basis for cable to compete toe to toe down the road with what the networks are going to do,'' said <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Sassa </PERSON>, the network's 29-year-old executive vice president. `` We've moved from cable providing a strong television signal to becoming a provider of alternative programming, a variety of programs,'' said <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Kupinski </PERSON>, an industry analyst with <ORGANIZATION> A.G. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Edwards </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sons </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>. And TNT, which unlike movie channels allows local cable systems to sell four minutes of advertising each hour, is `` great for the cable industry itself,'' <PERSON> Kupinski </PERSON> said. `` Any addition in programming is kind of a big benefit for cable, especially exclusive programming.'' The network promises it will plow 80 percent of its revenues for the first three years into original programming, and <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> himself told cable company executives in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> for a trade show that the network would lose $ 40 million before breaking even. `` That 80 percent is crucial,'' <PERSON> Gerbrandt </PERSON> said. Whereas many cable networks are `` concept-driven _ all-news, all-sports _ this is a real program-driven idea where it will succeed program by program,'' he said. <PERSON> Sassa </PERSON> estimates it will take two years to lose that $ 40 million. But as <PERSON> Sassa </PERSON> and <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> point out, the start-up costs for <ORGANIZATION> TNT </ORGANIZATION> would be greatly increased without <PERSON> Turner </PERSON>'s purchase two years ago of the film libraries. `` If we did n't have the MGM library, and the RKO and <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> libraries, we never could have started the networks and that was a billion and a half dollar investment,'' <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> said. Turner acquired more than 3,000 films when he purchased <ORGANIZATION> MGM </ORGANIZATION> @ <ORGANIZATION> UA </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Entertainment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, then sold all but the films to pay for the transaction. The deal left Turner saddled with $ 1.4 billion of debt, and raised doubts about whether he could survive. That debt has since been refinanced, and large cable companies have bought interest in <ORGANIZATION> Turner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Broadcasting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, gaining seats on the board of directors and say-so over large financial decisions. <PERSON> Gerbrandt </PERSON> said financial restrictions imposed on Turner by the cable operators have contributed to the company's ability to recover from the <ORGANIZATION> MGM </ORGANIZATION> deal. Turner executives also point to that cable participation as a key to the company's survival, and as a guarantee to the industry that <ORGANIZATION> TBS </ORGANIZATION> will remain a key provider of programming for their systems. `` We're not going to take your money and head for <LOCATION> Monte </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carlo </LOCATION> with it, or take it and put it into a project for <ORGANIZATION> CBS </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> NBC </ORGANIZATION> or <ORGANIZATION> ABC </ORGANIZATION> like some of the other interests whose ownership is more committed to network television than it is to the cable industry,'' <PERSON> Turner </PERSON> told the cable operators. Unlike the <ORGANIZATION> Fox </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Network </ORGANIZATION>, which broadcasts original programming on weekend nights over the airwaves, <ORGANIZATION> TNT </ORGANIZATION> will be a 24-hour cable operation. One of the keys to the success of <ORGANIZATION> TNT </ORGANIZATION>, according to <PERSON> Gerbrandt </PERSON>, analyst for <PERSON> Kagan </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Associates </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Carmel </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, is the acceptance by cable systems, whose limited channel space already is overwhelmed. `` I think the general sense in the industry is that -LRB- TNT -RRB- is an idea whose time has come, -LRB- but -RRB- he's launching it at a time when channel capacity is not exactly abundant,'' <PERSON> Gerbrandt </PERSON> said in a telephone interview. `` The real push is going to be in systems launching Jan. 1 and mid-89,'' <PERSON> Gerbrandt </PERSON> said, because that's typically when cable systems change services as they kick in rate increases. `` Also, ... if you're going to change your lineup, you do it at that time.'' A recent survey indicates the service has broad support among some of the major system operators. <LOCATION> Beaufort </LOCATION>, N.C.-based <ORGANIZATION> Marquest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Research </ORGANIZATION> said it interviewed key executives at 15 companies ranking among the top 25 multiple system cable operators, including eight of the top 10. It said two-thirds of those surveyed said <ORGANIZATION> TNT </ORGANIZATION> would be given broad carriage across their systems, with the remaining third saying carriage would be moderate.

<HEAD>Kennedy May Hold Decisive Vote as Supreme Court Opens New Term</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICHARD CARELLI</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>WASHINGTON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> begins its 1988-89 term Monday with its newest justice, <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, holding what may be the decisive vote in major controversies over civil rights, affirmative action, capital punishment and drug-testing. Many experts say <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, beginning his first full term since becoming a justice last February, could determine whether the court's erratic 20-year drift toward conservatism will accelerate dramatically. `` We're not sure where he lines up,'' said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Krattenmaker </PERSON>, dean of the <ORGANIZATION> Georgetown </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Law </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. `` It will be interesting to see whether <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> takes the middle road or opts for a more ideological route.'' Over the next nine months, the court has agreed to rule on these issues: _ The death penalty for convicted murderers who committed their crimes before reaching the age of 18 _ The death penalty for mentally retarded killers _ The power of local governments to require that a certain percentage of public works projects be awarded to minority-owned construction businesses _ Mandatory drug testing for railroad employees involved in serious accidents and for people seeking drug-enforcement jobs within the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Customs </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Service </ORGANIZATION> _ The continued vitality of a 1976 <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> decision used to fight private, or non-governmental, racial discrimination The court could be deeply divided on each issue. An anticipated bellwether for <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> and the court is a <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> case involving charges of on-the-job racial harassment. The justices, with <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> on the side of the majority, voted 5-4 last April to use the case to reconsider a 1976 decision called <PERSON> Runyon </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> McCrary </PERSON>. In the 1976 decision, the court said racially segregated private schools violate a federal civil rights law when they refuse to admit black students. The ruling let civil rights groups use that law as a weapon in attacking other forms of private bias as well. Justice <PERSON> Harry </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Blackmun </PERSON> recently told a group of law students in <LOCATION> Arkansas </LOCATION>, `` I think the outcome of the case will be of some significance as to the movement of the court during the balance of the 20th Century.'' <PERSON> Marsha </PERSON> <PERSON> Levick </PERSON>, executive director of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Organization </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> for </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Women </ORGANIZATION>'s legal arm, said <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s votes in the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Carolina </LOCATION> case and other pending civil rights disputes are key. `` <PERSON> Anthony </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> is absolutely someone to watch. He has not been generous in his reading of civil rights laws'' as a federal appeals court judge, she said. <PERSON> Blackmun </PERSON>, author of the high court's 1973 decision legalizing abortion, told his <ORGANIZATION> Arkansas </ORGANIZATION> audience that <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>'s views on the issue _ as yet unknown _ could put the landmark <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> ruling in jeopardy if a new abortion case wins the court's review. `` The next question is, ` <PERSON> Will </PERSON> <PERSON> Roe </PERSON> vs. <PERSON> Wade </PERSON> go down the drain?' I think there's a very distinct possibility it will _ this term,'' <PERSON> Blackmun </PERSON> said. Four court members _ Chief Justice <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> H. </PERSON> <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON> and Justices <PERSON> Byron </PERSON> <PERSON> R. </PERSON> <PERSON> White </PERSON>, <PERSON> Antonin </PERSON> <PERSON> Scalia </PERSON> and <PERSON> Sandra </PERSON> <PERSON> Day </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> _ have criticized the 1973 decision. In an apparent reference to <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, <PERSON> Blackmun </PERSON> added, `` One never knows what a new justice's attitude is -LRB- toward overturning past decisions -RRB-.'' <PERSON> Krattenmaker </PERSON> warned against judging <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> by his initial votes, noting that in his early years on the court <PERSON> Blackmun </PERSON> was considered a staunch conservative but is now viewed as a leading liberal on many issues. `` We may not learn anything this term -LRB- about <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> -RRB- that turns out to be enduring,'' <PERSON> Krattenmaker </PERSON> said. Noting that <PERSON> Blackmun </PERSON> soon will be 80 and that the court's two leading liberals, Justices <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> and <PERSON> Thurgood </PERSON> <PERSON> Marshall </PERSON>, are in their 80s, <PERSON> Krattenmaker </PERSON> said, `` We must look for signs or signals that one or more of the justices is considering retirement.'' The court's conservatives are much younger. <PERSON> Rehnquist </PERSON> is 63, White 71, <PERSON> Scalia </PERSON> 52, <PERSON> O'Connor </PERSON> 58, and <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> 52. The court's ninth member, Justice <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Paul </PERSON> <PERSON> Stevens </PERSON>, is 68. Here, in summary form, are some of the cases the <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> is expected to decide this term:

 Bullish American Petroleum Institute statistics on domestic oil inventories have produced mixed results in the futures market. On the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the November contract for <ORGANIZATION> West </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Intermediate </ORGANIZATION>, the benchmark <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> crude, settled 3 cents lower at $ 14.11 a barrel Wednesday after trading between $ 14.06 and $ 14.27 during the day. Other contract months closed lower. Wholesale unleaded gasoline for October delivery gained 0.58 cent to settle at 46.17 cents a gallon, while other contract months closed mixed. October heating oil edged down 0.01 cent to 39.50 cents a gallon, with other contract months declining. API statistics released after the close of trading Tuesday showed that although gasoline inventories were up 2.2 million barrels on a weekly basis to 219 million barrels, they 10 million barrels below the same period a year earlier. Heating oil stocks were up 3 million barrels from a year earlier, while crude oil was down 4 million barrels to 319 million barrels, below the 337 million barrels of inventory last year, according to API. Analysts said the lower crude statistics were considered bullish, but the decline was n't enough to offset concerns about the oversupply of oil on world markets that has depressed prices recently. Wednesday's gains, they said, stemmed from the combination of lower gasoline stocks and API figures showing a drop in refinery runs, down 550,000 barrels a day to 12.79 million barrels. `` When refinery runs go down then less gasoline will be coming out,'' said <PERSON> Stephen </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON>, research analyst with <ORGANIZATION> Bear </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stearns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co.

 <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communication </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 1.2 billion acquisition of <ORGANIZATION> Lorimar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Telepictures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> eventually will be completed even though a state court has blocked the planned merger, analysts predict. <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Supreme </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> Justice <PERSON> Walter </PERSON> <PERSON> Schackman </PERSON> granted an injunction against the deal Tuesday, ruling it violated a 1984 pact between <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> and its biggest shareholder, <ORGANIZATION> Chris-Craft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a broadcasting and manufacturing company. <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> says it will appeal the ruling. At issue are <PERSON> Lorimar </PERSON>'s televison stations. Chris-Craft claimed in a suit filed in July that because <PERSON> Lorimar </PERSON> owned six stations, the merger violated a 4-year-old pact prohibiting <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> from owning any TV station so long as it owned 25 percent or more of Chris-Craft's <ORGANIZATION> BHC </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> broadcasting subsidiary. <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> acquired a 42.5 percent stake in <ORGANIZATION> BHC </ORGANIZATION> in 1984 in exchange for Chris-Craft getting 23 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>'s voting stock. In his 13-page decision Tuesday, <PERSON> Schackman </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> could not acquire any <ORGANIZATION> Lorimar </ORGANIZATION> stock until the TV stations were sold or it reduced its stake in <ORGANIZATION> BHC </ORGANIZATION>. Since the Chris-Craft suit was filed, <PERSON> Lorimar </PERSON> completed the sale of network-affiliated television stations in <LOCATION> Odessa </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION>; <LOCATION> Springfield </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Mo </LOCATION>.; and <PERSON> Redding </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, to a partnership that includes a former <ORGANIZATION> Lorimar </ORGANIZATION> executive. It also reached an agreement in principle to sell a fourth station in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>, but two independent stations in <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> remain on the auction block. Some analysts familiar with the case predicted the dispute would be settled before the appeal process was concluded, because the only remaining issue was the sale of the two <LOCATION> Puerto </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Rico </LOCATION> stations. `` The stations have been on the market for over a year and a half and they've yet to see a buyer,'' said <PERSON> Christopher </PERSON> <PERSON> P. </PERSON> <PERSON> Dixon </PERSON>, an analyst with the investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Kidder </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Peabody </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` I expect to find a buyer ... they -LRB- <ORGANIZATION> Lorimar </ORGANIZATION> -RRB- will have to consider bids that they were not willing to consider before. `` I expect the Lorimar deal to close, but obviously the time frame has become extended.'' The <ORGANIZATION> Warner-Lorimar </ORGANIZATION> deal was reached last spring. <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> said it would pay $ 630 million in cash and stock for all the outstanding shares of <ORGANIZATION> Lorimar </ORGANIZATION> and assume $ 550 million in debt, giving the deal a total value of $ 1.18 billion. <PERSON> Lorimar </PERSON>, based in <LOCATION> Culver </LOCATION> <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Calif. </LOCATION>, produces several hit TV shows, including `` <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>,'' `` Knots Landing'' and `` Alf.'' It also has a strong lineup of syndicated shows sold directly to individual television stations. New York-based <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION>'s interests include movies, cable television and magazine publishing. <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> stock rose 50 cents a share to $ 36 <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> trading. <PERSON> Lorimar </PERSON> fell $ 1.50 a share to $ 12.50 on the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>.

 <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Holmes </PERSON> said the company actively is looking for buyers for the Puerto Rican stations and would not sell any shares of <ORGANIZATION> BHC </ORGANIZATION>. The company had maintained in court filings that it would be hurt financially if it was forced to sell its <ORGANIZATION> BHC </ORGANIZATION> stake at `` fire sale'' prices. <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> contends the proposed merger would not violate the agreement with Chris-Craft because <ORGANIZATION> Warner </ORGANIZATION> planned to set up an independent trust, pending approval from the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Communications </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, to run the remaining <ORGANIZATION> Lorimar </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> TV </ORGANIZATION> stations. The <ORGANIZATION> Warner-Lorimar </ORGANIZATION> deal also needs approval from <ORGANIZATION> Lorimar </ORGANIZATION> shareholders. A special meeting was scheduled for Oct. 3, although a <ORGANIZATION> Lorimar </ORGANIZATION> spokeswoman declined to say whether Tuesday's court decision would force a postponement.

<HEAD>Interest Rate Rise Seen as Threat to Third World</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By CARL HARTMAN</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>BERLIN (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Finance officials from 151 countries, wrapping up the annual <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank-International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> meeting today, heard some grim warnings about the threat of high interest rates on the Third World, which already is reeling under a $ 1.2 trillion debt. Industrialized nations see higher interest rates as a way to curb inflation, and in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, to attract money from abroad to finance the federal budget deficit. But higher rates also mean higher debt payments for Third World countries. `` Every rise of one percentage point in interest rates costs the debtors another $ 6 billion a year,'' said <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Fischer </PERSON>, vice president and chief economist of the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. Developing nations already pay more than $ 50 billion a year on loans subject to variable interest rates, and complain that too large a share of their earnings go to pay interest, leaving little to improve living standards. In many of debtors, especially in <LOCATION> sub-Saharan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, incomes have been declining for 20 years. `` It would be highly undesirable if an excessive concern for inflation were to bring about a spiral of interest rate rises,'' said <PERSON> Giuliano </PERSON> <PERSON> Amato </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s treasury minister. The <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> is the chief source of aid for Third World countries, lending about $ 17 billion annually. The <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION>, which lends about $ 8 billion a year, originally was concerned with keeping currency rates stable. Now both bodies devote most of their efforts to helping arrange new loans for Third World countries, in the hope that the money will be more wisely invested and help debtors `` grow out'' of their troubles. Delegates to the meetings from rich and poor countries have been searching for new ways to lighten the debt burden. Attention has concentrated on a proposal from <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> outlined Tuesday by <PERSON> Satoshi </PERSON> <PERSON> Sumita </PERSON>, governor of the <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Japan </ORGANIZATION>. It would turn some of the debt into bonds and sell them to the public, delaying repayment by many years. The bonds would be backed by money paid into special accounts, managed by the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION>. Repayment of the rest of the debt would be stretched out. But many said <PERSON> Sumita </PERSON>'s speech left many questions about the plan unanswered, such as the advantages to the debtors or whether the plan shift the risk for the original loans from creditor banks to the banks' governments and their taxpayers. Another issue arising at the meeting was the future of the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION>'s monetary unit _ the `` special drawing right'' or SDR The fund first issued SDRs in 1972 with the hope they eventually would replace gold, the dollar and other currencies as the world's major reserve asset It was thought the international monetary system could then be better managed, and no longer would depend so much on gold mining in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> and on <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> domestic policy about the dollar. About $ 27 billion worth of SDRs have been issued, the last batch in 1981, and the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has resisted any further issue. SDRs, now worth about $ 1.29 each, are traded only among governments and some specially authorized banks. <PERSON> Sumita </PERSON> suggested expanding use of the SDR, and perhaps extending it to private business. There should be more reserve currencies `` to complement the dollar's key role,'' he said. He also said <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> was removing barriers to the use of the yen as an international currency. <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, the new <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> secretary of the <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION>, did not comment publicly. Any discussion of reducing the international role of the dollar could be politically explosive in a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> election year. Others at the meeting have been skeptical about any bigger role for the SDR, including West German Finance Minister <PERSON> Gerhard </PERSON> <PERSON> Stoltenberg </PERSON> and <PERSON> Nigel </PERSON> <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON>, the British chancellor of the exchequer. <PERSON> Lawson </PERSON> said nothing had come of the persistent effort to replace the dollar with the SDR, and he believed it was unlikely anything would. <PERSON> Stoltenberg </PERSON> said: `` We should n't attach too high expectations to this.''

<HEAD>Judge Dismisses Icahn Challenge To Texaco Restructuring</HEAD>

<TEXT>
 It may be time for takeover strategist <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> and others involved in <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s landmark bankruptcy reorganization to `` take their marbles and go home,'' according to the judge who dismissed <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>'s challenge to the restructuring. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Gerard </PERSON> <PERSON> Goettel </PERSON> ruled Wednesday that the <ORGANIZATION> Icahn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION>'s appeal of two key parts of the plan was moot because the group did not move fast enough to block confirmation of <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 5.6 billion reorganization. <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON>, who is <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>'s largest shareholder, has sought to gain representation on the oil giant's board of directors and otherwise raise takeover pressure on the company in order to boost its stock price. `` Whatever future designs the <ORGANIZATION> Icahn </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Group </ORGANIZATION> may harbor for <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>, fallout from the <LOCATION> Texaco-Getty </LOCATION> merger has been littering the economic landscape for the past four years,'' wrote <PERSON> Goettel </PERSON>. The judge advised the parties to `` take their marbles and go home, closing out one of the most bizarre chapters of American legal and economic history.'' Neither <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> nor <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> had any immediate comment on the ruling. <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>'s 1984 acquisition of <ORGANIZATION> Getty </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Oil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> spawned a lawsuit by rival <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, which claimed <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> wrongly interfered with its takeover of <PERSON> Getty </PERSON>. In 1985, a <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> jury awarded <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION> $ 10.3 billion in damages, an award upheld throughout the <LOCATION> Texas </LOCATION> state courts. To avoid having to post a bond equivalent to the award in order to appeal the judgment, <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> sought protection from creditors under Chapter 11 of the federal bankruptcy law in April 1987. When <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> announced a $ 3 billion settlement with <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION> as part of the reorganization plan, <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> _ who controls 14.9 percent of <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>'s outstanding shares _ announced his opposition to two aspects of the plan. <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> opposed a provision releasing <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>'s officers from pesonal liability resulting from the merger and attendant lawsuit. <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> also objected to a provision in a financing clause that said any change of control in the company's management would constitute default on a bank loan. While objecting to the two provisions, <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> nonetheless voted for the plan and never sought a stay of the shareholder vote or of its implementation. The plan was approved by <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> shareholders and the comapny emerged from Chapter 11 in April. <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> later lost a proxy fight aimed at gaining control of five seats on the <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> board. In addition to the settlement with <ORGANIZATION> Pennzoil </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION>'s reorganization included the sale of 50 percent of its refining and marketing operations in 23 states to <LOCATION> Saudi </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Arabia </LOCATION>, the sale of its West German operations to Rheinish-Westfaelisches <ORGANIZATION> Elektrizitaetswerk </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> AG </ORGANIZATION> and the proposed sale of its 78 percent stake in <ORGANIZATION> Texaco </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canada </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>

<HEAD>Twentieth Birthday Of 747s To Be Marked By Seattle Flyby</HEAD>
<DATELINE>SEATTLE (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The first and latest versions of the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 will fly side-by-side over <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> on Friday to mark the 20th birthday of the world's largest commercial jet. The <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747s, each with the trademark hump on top of its cockpit and front cabin, will fly over <PERSON> Elliott </PERSON> <PERSON> Bay </PERSON> and <PERSON> Mount </PERSON> <PERSON> Rainier </PERSON>, weather permitting, to give <LOCATION> Seattle </LOCATION> residents another look at the region's most famous product. `` Of all our planes, the 747's the most recognized worldwide,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Jimenez </PERSON>, a <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. Since the first flight in 1969, the 12 different versions of <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747s produced in <LOCATION> Everett </LOCATION> have flown almost 850 million passengers and about 12 billion miles worldwide. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> has received orders for 875 of the 747s since <ORGANIZATION> Pan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION> ordered the first 25 in 1966. Industry analysts say the 747, with a price tag of about $ 125 million a plane, up from about $ 20 million for the originals, brings the most cash to <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>. On the surface, the earliest 747 and the brand new 747-400 model making Friday's flyby look much the same. But company officials say the two planes have more differences than similarities. The original 747 had a maximum takeoff weight of 710,000 pounds and could carry 385 passengers about 4,000 nautical miles. The 747-400 has a maximum takeoff weight of 870,000 pounds and can carry 412 passengers 7,300 nautical miles. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> expects the first 747-400 to be certified by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> by year-end and then sold to <ORGANIZATION> Northwest </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> officials say they are confident the 747 will retain a strong position worldwide, despite competition from <ORGANIZATION> McDonnell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Douglas </ORGANIZATION>' MD-11 in 1990 and from <ORGANIZATION> Airbus </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industrie </ORGANIZATION>'s A340. `` There's still a huge potential because of passenger growth and for replacing older planes,'' said <PERSON> Phil </PERSON> <PERSON> Condit </PERSON>, executive vice president of <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commercial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airplanes </ORGANIZATION>. `` The 5 percent predicted growth in air traffic is a lot of people, and as airports get more congested, airlines will want the large 747s,'' <PERSON> Condit </PERSON> said. The 747-400 wo n't be the end of the line of 747s. <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> designers are considering shortening the jumbo jet to make it more efficient, or stretching it to accomodate another 150 passengers. <PERSON> Malcolm </PERSON> <PERSON> Stamper </PERSON>, the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> vice chairman who oversaw the building of the first 747, said <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>'s success comes from meeting market demand. For example, the <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> 747 design evolved when the company was considering enlarging its popular 707. The 747 was conceived in 1965 because air-traffic growth required a larger, all-new plane, said <PERSON> Joe </PERSON> <PERSON> Sutter </PERSON>, chief designer of the 747, who is now retired but works as a consultant for <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION>. At the same time, <ORGANIZATION> Boeing </ORGANIZATION> was designing a supersonic transport, and most industry officials thought the 747 would be used mainly as a cargo plane and most passengers would choose the faster SST. The hump at the front of the 747 originally was intended to facilitate loading large cargo containers. But when government funding for the SST was canceled, the 747 became the dominant long-haul carrier.

 <ORGANIZATION> The </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> will increase its yearly loans nearly 50 percent by 1992 to help end poverty in the Third World, the organization's president said today. <PERSON> Barber </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Conable </PERSON> spoke in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> during the annual meeting of the bank and its sister organization, the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION>. Participants from 151 nations have spent a week exploring ways to lighten the debt load of poor nations. The meeting ends today. Leftist groups have mounted protests to criticize the international banks, which make development loans, for insisting on repayment by Third World nations. About 1,000 demonstrators gathered at a church nearby Wednesday and chanted `` <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> Murder Meeting.'' Thousands of riot police held them back with plastic shields. Third World countries owe about $ 1.2 trillion to international and private lenders as well as governments. <PERSON> Conable </PERSON> predicted that the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> will be lending $ 25 billion dollars a year by 1992 to Third World nations. It now lends about $ 17 billion a year, and the monetary fund provides about $ 8 million more. Speaking at a news conference, he said $ 5 billion will go to the poorest countries, which are mainly in <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Conable </PERSON> said the bank will strengthen its aid by sharing more financing with other donors. He said Japanese officials have told him they plan to help and promised to talk with him about a program. Contributions to the bank come from the 151 member governments. <PERSON> Conable </PERSON> also pinpointed trade imbalances as part of the debt problem faced by poor countries. He said they cause losses twice as great as the aid such countries receive from wealthier nations. Speakers from the Third World have protested repeatedly at the meeting that the industrial countries put up barriers to their exports that prevent debtor countries from earning money. In an interview before his news conference, <PERSON> Conable </PERSON> said he believed interest rates were stabilizing after recent increases. The financial leaders have listened this week to warnings that higher interest rates, used by the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and other industrial countries to cool inflation, threaten the Third World. `` It would be highly undesirable if an excessive concern for inflation were to bring about a spiral of interest rate rises,'' said <PERSON> Giuliano </PERSON> <PERSON> Amato </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>'s treasury minister. At Wednesday's sessions, participants seeking new ways to ease the burden of debt heard about the cost of higher interest rates to Third World countries. Every 1 percent rise in interest rates costs the debtors $ 6 billion more a year, said <PERSON> Stanley </PERSON> <PERSON> Fischer </PERSON>, vice president and chief economist of the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and other industrial countries view higher interest as a way of controlling price increases. In the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, higher interest rates also attract money from abroad to meet the federal budget deficit. Third World countries pay more than $ 50 billion a year on loans subject to variable interest rates. They complain that too much of their earnings go to pay interest, leaving little to improve living standards. In many of them, especially in sub-Saharan <LOCATION> Africa </LOCATION>, people's incomes have been declining for 20 years.

 A federal judge, citing a conflict of interest, has disqualified a law firm from representing a $ 2.5 billion trust fund set up to compensate women injured by the Dalkon Shield intrauterine device. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Albert </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Alexandria </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Va. </LOCATION>, ruled Wednesday that <PERSON> Cadwalader </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Wickersham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Taft </PERSON> could n't represent the trustees because it had advised claimants in the bankruptcy-law proceedings of <ORGANIZATION> A.H. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Robins </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, a health-products firm that produced the <ORGANIZATION> Dalkon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Shield </ORGANIZATION>.

<HEAD>Strike-Triggering Austerity Program To Be Amended</HEAD>
<DATELINE>BELGRADE, Yugoslavia (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An unpopular emergency economic program, which has triggered a wave of strikes in <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> because it allowed price hikes while limiting wages, will be amended next week, newspapers reported Thursday. Changes in the program, that will include wage increases for workers of those companies which are making profits, are scheduled to be adopted in <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s parliament on Oct. 3, the <ORGANIZATION> Borba </ORGANIZATION> newspaper said. There have been numerous protest marches in <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> by workers publicly airing their grievances after the government introduced the austerity program last May, allowing substantial price hikes and hefty wage cuts. The program lifted price controls for about 60 percent of goods and services which had been under a price freeze since November last year. The unpopular measures contributed to a further decline of living standards, which have fallen by more than one-third since 1980. Labor unrest also increased. <LOCATION> Yugoslav </LOCATION> officials have repeatedly claimed that there is no alternative to the market-oriented program, worked out together with the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION>, if the country wants to lower its 200 percent inflation and repay its $ 21 billion foreign debt. Borba quoted Yugoslav officials as saying that negotiations are in progress with the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> in order to get the Fund's approval for changing wage increase restrictions now in the economic program. The adoption of the program was a precondition set by the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> and other creditors for rescheduling of <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION>'s foreign debt and obtaining new credits. During the first nine months of this year, salaries in <LOCATION> Yugoslavia </LOCATION> have dropped by 10 percent in real terms compared with the same period last year, and have reached the level of early 1970s, newspapers reported. Meanwhile, <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION> shoppers were hit Thursday by a fresh wave of price hikes, ranging from 300 to over 1,000 percent, the <ORGANIZATION> Politika </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ekspres </ORGANIZATION> daily reported. Of about 600 products, including food, drinks and cosmetics whose prices went up in <LOCATION> Belgrade </LOCATION> shops Thursday, the highest increase was recorded by a brand cheese _ 1,221 percent, said the newspaper.

<HEAD>Angry Investors Demonstrate; Call For Stock Market Closure</HEAD>
<DATELINE>TAIPEI, Taiwan (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 About 800 investors angered by plunging share prices demonstrated outside the <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> Thursday to demand the government postpone or withdraw its plan to reimpose a stock profit tax. The investors, shouting `` Step Down -LRB- Finance Minister -RRB- <PERSON> Shirley </PERSON> <PERSON> Kuo </PERSON>!'' were prevented by police from entering the ministry building. Some protesters called for closure of the stock market while the government works out a more acceptable tax plan with investors. Earlier Thursday, stock brokerage firms were flooded with selling orders that found few buyers when the market re-opened after a four-day holiday for the mid-autumn festival. The stock index fell 175.96 points to close at 8,613.62 points on what many traders called `` Black Thursday.'' Of the 151 shares listed on the market, 114 posted the maximum 3 percent daily loss allowed by the government. Three shares recorded gains and there was no transaction on the others. Turnover totaled 280 million <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> dollars -LRB- $ 9.6 million -RRB- down from Saturday's 47.5 billion <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> dollars -LRB- $ 1.6 billion -RRB-. On Saturday, the <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said the government next year would reimpose a tax on stock profits. The plan calls for investors who sell stocks worth more than 3 million <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> dollars -LRB- $ 103,400 -RRB- in one year to include their stock income when filing their annual personal income tax. Many protesters said they wanted the government to scrap the tax, but others demanded lower tax rates or postponing implementation of the tax plan by one year. `` We were caught up,'' said an investor, who identified herself only as Ms. <PERSON> Wu </PERSON>. `` The government should not have waited till now to announce the severe tax. It should have done this half a year ago before prices soared up like this.'' She said she purchased 10 million <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> dollars -LRB- about $ 350,000 -RRB- in stocks Saturday when the market index hit a record high of 8,789.78 points, a 275 percent increase from last December. <PERSON> Lee </PERSON> <PERSON> Ching-tu </PERSON>, one of 10 protesters later allowed in the ministry to state their cases, said the market should be closed temporarily to prevent investors from `` dumping their shares amid uncertainties.'' The protesters were received by <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> official <PERSON> Wang </PERSON> <PERSON> Cheng-yi </PERSON>, who agreed to pass their opinions to the authorities. Market analysts expect stock prices to continue to drop for another two weeks before stabilizing. The government, they said, imposed the tax to control rampant stock speculation that could have resulted in severe losses for investors if the market had crashed. <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s stock market has been manipulated by major players including underground investment firms that attract deposits by offering as much as 4 percent monthly interest. Analysts say a market crash could have forced those companies to close and result in losses to numerous investors. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Chien </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Federated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Consulting </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Company </ORGANIZATION>, said the tax measure `` was too drastic and came too late.'' <PERSON> Kuo </PERSON> said Tuesday the stock tax would not trigger a market crash because <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> has a robust economy that can sustain a market growth. <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s economy grew 11 percent last year and is expected to grow 7.3 percent this year. The stock income tax was lifted in 1976 when <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION>'s economy slowed because of the world oil crisis. The <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> said investors who hold their purchased shares for a year or more would have half of their shares waived from taxes to encourage long-term investments. Workers who earn more than 3.5 million <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> dollars -LRB- $ 121,000 -RRB- a year pay the top personal income tax of 50 percent.

 The stock market headed higher in light trading today, struggling to break its recent stalemate. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials rose 5.15 to 2,090.68 in the first half hour of trading. Gainers outnumbered losers by about 5 to 4 in the overall tally of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 443 up, 357 down and 531 unchanged. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 16.51 million shares as of 10 a.m. on Wall Street. Analysts said there was nothing in the news to stir up much buying interest. However, they said, it appeared some traders were nibbling at stocks this morning simply because the market has n't sold off lately despite a long list of worries and uncertainties. Among those problems are the approaching first anniversary of Black Monday on Oct. 19, which is presumed to be casting a pall over the market. In addition, investors are said to be reluctant to commit themselves before they can get a clearer idea of where government economic policy is headed after the election of a new president.

<HEAD>Industry Leaders Think Congress Can Override Textile Bill Veto</HEAD>
<DATELINE>ATLANTA (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Apparel industry leaders were undaunted after President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s veto of the textile imports bill, predicting election-year politics would help supporters of the measure swing enough votes for a congressional override. `` Politically, these are very hot times,'' predicted <PERSON> Howard </PERSON> <PERSON> Cooley </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Jockey </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> and president of the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Apparel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION>, which is holding its annual meeting during a trade show in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> this week. `` There will be an override effort,'' he said. `` We suspect that there will be some votes changing,'' he said. The bill would limit import growth for apparel and textile products to 1 percent a year beginning in January, freeze imports of non-rubber footwear and impose quotas on 180 categories of textile products and 30 types of footwear. The bill passed the <ORGANIZATION> Senate </ORGANIZATION> 59-36, four votes short of the needed two-thirds to override; the <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> approved the bill 248-150, 17 votes shy. The battle to override will be close, `` but it's winnable,'' said Rep. <PERSON> Ed </PERSON> <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON>, D-Ga., a supporter of the bill, which President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> vetoed Wednesday The main purpose of the legislation, <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON> said, is to apply pressure on <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> to enforce existing textile import restrictions. `` Even if we do not override, we try to keep the pressure on the president to make sure he enforces the existing agreements,'' <PERSON> Jenkins </PERSON> said. <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Textile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Manufacturers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Daniel </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Frierson </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Dixie </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Yarns </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said, `` The veto shows a callous disregard for millions of workers who jobs are being wiped out by imports. `` We believe that the celebration by foreign interests and giant, money-grubbing importers will be brief because <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> will override the veto,'' <PERSON> Frierson </PERSON> said in a statement released in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Cooley </PERSON> said the import bill would have brought order to national trade policy, which he said penalizes apparel and textile manufacturers. `` We are the most labor-intensive industry and therefore are much more subject to -LRB- competition from -RRB- the lesser developed countries,'' <PERSON> Cooley </PERSON> told reporters during a news conference. Also predicting an override was <PERSON> Joseph </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Edalin </PERSON>, vice chairman of underwear manufacturer Fruit of the <ORGANIZATION> Loom </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc </ORGANIZATION>. The bill was supported by both management and labor with conservative Southern lawmakers, who represent textile-producing areas, working with such labor unions as the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ladies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Garment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Amalgamated </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Clothing </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Textile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION>. `` I'm very disappointed, but not totally surprised at <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON>'s decision,'' said <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> K. </PERSON> <PERSON> Tribble </PERSON>, a regional ACTWU director from <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> who was in <LOCATION> Atlanta </LOCATION> for the show He predicted an override effort stood `` a fair-to-middlin' chance of success. <PERSON> Tribble </PERSON> also blamed imports for contributing to recent shakeups in the industry which have seen some of the largest manufacturers broken up or taken over in leveraged buyouts. Not all apparel executives support the bill. One opposed was <PERSON> Erle </PERSON> <PERSON> Norton </PERSON>, vice president of Atlanta-based <ORGANIZATION> Oxford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, one of the nation's 10 largest apparel manufacturers. He said the measure would hurt companies such as his which use some imported fabrics, or are involved in operations whereby cut material is sent overseas for sewing, and then brought back into the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> at reduced tariffs. `` Sometimes the cure can be worse than the disease,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Slossberg </PERSON>, vice president and general manager of <ORGANIZATION> Caleb </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> V. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <ORGANIZATION> Son </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, a Galion, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>, uniform manufacturer. `` If we get into a protectionist profile, somewhere else down the line, somebody's going to get hurt,'' <PERSON> Slossberg </PERSON> said.

 The stock market staged a broad advance today, bidding to break its recent stalemate. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials climbed 16.53 points to 2,102.06 by 11 a.m. on Wall Street. Gainers outnumbered losers by more than 2 to 1 in the overall tally of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 746 up, 327 down and 567 unchanged. Volume on the <ORGANIZATION> Big </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> came to 47.89 million shares at midmorning. Analysts said there was nothing in the news to stir up much buying interest. However, they said, it appeared some traders were nibbling at stocks this morning simply because the market has n't sold off lately despite a long list of worries and uncertainties. Among those problems are the approaching first anniversary of Black Monday on Oct. 19, which is presumed to be casting a pall over the market. In addition, investors are said to be reluctant to commit themselves before they can get a clearer idea of where government economic policy is headed after the election of a new president. Gainers in the blue-chip sector included <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION>, up -RCB- at 44; <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION>, up -LCB- at 114 -RRB-; <ORGANIZATION> Exxon </ORGANIZATION>, up \ at 44 -RCB-, and <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION>, up \ at 24. The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>'s composite index of all its listed common stocks rose .86 to 152.89. At the <ORGANIZATION> American </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, the market value index was up .58 at 299.45.

 To the delight of two <LOCATION> Minnesota </LOCATION> companies, exercise enthusiasts around the country are rollicking on a new set of wheels that look like ice skates and ride like roller skates. `` We're going after people who want to have some serious fun and want to make the investment in the product,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Sundet </PERSON>, president of <ORGANIZATION> Eden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Prairie-based </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rollerblade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Sundet </PERSON> would not disclose financial information about the privately held company, but said <PERSON> Rollerblade </PERSON> has 75 percent of the $ 10 million to $ 12 million market for the skates Rollerblade's top competitor is <PERSON> Blaine </PERSON>, Minn.-based First Team Sports, which sells its version of the in-line skate under the brand name of Ultra-Wheels. `` It's a healthy competition,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Egart </PERSON>, vice president of marketing for First Team Sports. He said <PERSON> First </PERSON> <PERSON> Team </PERSON> has about 20 percent to 25 percent of what he estimates is an $ 8 million to $ 10 million market. `` It's very similar to roller skating, but it has the feel of ice skates,'' said skater <PERSON> Gary </PERSON> <PERSON> Baglien </PERSON>, who stopped for a breather during a recent spin around <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>' <PERSON> Lake </PERSON> <PERSON> Calhoun </PERSON>. `` There's definitely more speed than the conventional skates. <PERSON> Baglien </PERSON>, who skates every other day to stay in shape, said using the in-line skate is `` a little more tricky'' than the conventional skate, particularly when it comes to stopping. The `` in-line'' skate looks like a hockey skate mounted on a line of three or four wheels. A rubber brake pad is located on the back of the right skate as opposed to the front bumpers on many roller skates. Its popularity began among hockey players and cross-country skiers looking for a way to stay in shape during the off-season, but has recently spread to others looking for an alternative outdoor exercise. The company's biggest markets used to be in ice-skating strongholds such as <LOCATION> Boston </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Minneapolis </LOCATION>, but now the hottest sales are in southern <LOCATION> California </LOCATION>, where they're popular in places such as <LOCATION> Venice </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s Central Park is another popular spot for single-track skaters. `` It's not a toy, not a frivolous type item. It's to an extent a recreational product,'' said <PERSON> Sundet </PERSON>. `` Fitness is the key, particularly with all the concern about health lately.'' A Rollerblade study claims to show that users of the skates improved aerobic endurance and reduced body fat. <PERSON> Sundet </PERSON> said skating with in-line skates is a great alternative to jogging because there is less pounding on the joints. The skates, which sell for between $ 89.95 and $ 175, are assembled at the company's Eden Prairie headquarters, then shipped across the country and overseas. Most of the parts are made overseas. `` We've barely tapped the market nationally. It has an enormous potential to become a nationally recognized product,'' said <PERSON> Sundet </PERSON>, who expects strong Christmas sales. <PERSON> Egart </PERSON> said First Team Sports is not particulalry troubled that `` rollerblade'' has become synonymous with in-line skates. `` We're doing our best to make people aware that there are other manufacturers out there other than Rollerblade,'' he said Two years ago, Rollerblade had two models of in-line skates; This fall, they have nine. The original model was black, similar to hockey skates, but Rollerblade is now using brightly-colored boots and wheels. Rollerblade is taking measures to ensure the skates will not become just another fad. The company is supporting an in-line skate federation, creating competitive events and is considering expanding into a line of accessories and clothing. `` I'm very optimistic that this is not a fad,'' said <PERSON> Sundet </PERSON>, who at age 40 is the company's oldest employee. `` We really do think there is a long-term market for this product.'' The company's sales in July were four times what they were last year, and <PERSON> Sundet </PERSON> said they plan to stay on top of the market. The company's marketing strategy includes skating demonstrations from seven vans that travel around the country. Rollerblade received a publicity boost last winter when <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> Bears Coach <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Ditka </PERSON> called the Metrodome the `` Rollerdome.'' <ORGANIZATION> Minnesota </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Vikings </ORGANIZATION> General Manager <PERSON> Mike </PERSON> <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> countered by sending <PERSON> Ditka </PERSON> a pair of Rollerblades and <PERSON> Lynn </PERSON> also outfitted the <ORGANIZATION> Vikings </ORGANIZATION>' cheerleaders with them to wear during the Dec. 6 Vikings-Bears matchup The company got its start nine years ago when <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> and <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> <PERSON> Olson </PERSON>, both high school hockey players, were looking for a way to condition in the summertime. The brothers purchased a pair of what <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> described as `` crude, slow'' in-line skates on sale for $ 15 at a sporting goods store, and set out to create a better skate. Six months later, they were selling them out of their parents' basement in <LOCATION> Bloomington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Minn. </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> <PERSON> Olson </PERSON> later sold the company while <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> stayed on and is now Rollerblade's director of research and `` We are constantly improving the product and coming up new ones that are more appealing to a wider variety,'' <PERSON> Brennan </PERSON> <PERSON> Scott </PERSON> said. While the in-line skate seems like the latest innovation in the skating world, the concept dates back to the early 1700s when a Dutchman nailed wooden spools to strips of wood and attached them to his shoes.

 Here are brief sketches of key studies into the October 1987 stock market collapse:
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>Presidential Task Force</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 This panel, appointed by President <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> and headed by now-Treasury Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, recommended that a supreme regulatory authority such as the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> oversee the markets now governed by separate agencies. It also recommended adoption of `` circuit breakers,'' such as price limits and trading halts, across all inter-related markets. In addition, it suggested higher margin or down-payment requirements for speculative trading in futures, and expedited settlement procedures for stock trading. Furthermore, the panel said computerized trading tactics, which a handful of large investors used to dump massive amounts of stocks, contributed to the speed and intensity of the collapse.

<BYLINE>White House Working Group on Financial Markets</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 This panel, headed by the Undersecretary for Finance <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> D. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gould </PERSON>, evaluated the conclusions of the Brady group, which were n't well received in the administration partly because they advocated more regulation The Gould panel, composed of senior aides in the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commodities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trading </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, rejected the idea of a single regulatory authority. It further rejected suggestions that the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> should regulate stock-index futures trading, which is regulated by the <ORGANIZATION> CFTC </ORGANIZATION>, although the panel endorsed raising margin requirements in futures.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>General Accounting Office</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 The investigative arm of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> concluded that computerized trading and the regulation of transactions should be overhauled to avoid another crash. Since the nation's financial markets are increasingly intertwined, federal agencies and market officials must monitor the entire system, not just individual stock exchanges, and trading officials must find ways to prevent plummeting prices in one exchange from spilling into others, the <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> said. The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> agreed with the <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> panel that government should more effectively supervise the markets, but it did n't endorse the idea of designating the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> for that job. It took no position on `` circuit breakers.'' The <ORGANIZATION> GAO </ORGANIZATION> is conducting a separate study, still in the early stages, that will examine the evolution of clearance and settlement procedures for securities and questions surrounding investor protection.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>Commodity Futures Trading Commission</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 The federal agency that oversees <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> commodities markets, where stock-index futures and options are traded, said it could find no evidence that computerized trading strategies caused or aggravated the market break. The commission blamed what it called `` unprecedented change'' in investor psychology, and suggested the crash was the culmination of a drop in stock prices that had begun months earlier.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>Securities and Exchange Commission</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 The federal agency that oversees stock and bond markets said computerized trading techniques did not cause the market plunge by themselves, but `` had an indirect negative effect.'' The <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> said `` changes in investor perception, institutional stock selling and program trading strategies combined to accelerate the market's downward slide. The agency opposed limits on price movements and did not call for a new regulatory authority to oversee all financial markets, as the Brady panel did. But the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> suggested increased curbs on stock-index futures.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>North American Securities Administrators Association</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 This group of state securities industry regulators concluded the crash revealed widespread shoddy sales practices by brokers. It urged tighter margin restrictions and disclosure requirements. The group's study, the first to come out after the October break, was based on complaints from investors.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>Office of Technology Assessment</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 This research arm of <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> has been asked to study the role that information technology is playing and will play in the structure and operations of the financial markets. The study is scheduled for completion in December 1989.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>New York Stock Exchange</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 The nation's biggest stock market largely blamed the crash on the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> futures markets, calling them a haven for speculators. The report recommended tighter restrictions on futures markets, including higher margin requirements. The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> further recommended that the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> regulate all financial instruments, including stock-index futures. Despite external criticism that the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> specialists who make markets in individual stocks failed to keep the market orderly during the crash, the exchange said the specialists generally performed well under crisis conditions.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>Chicago Mercantile Exchange</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 The nation's largest futures market blamed the crash on waves of selling that struck Wall Street and reverberated everywhere. It said stock-index futures trading played no role in the crash. Furthermore it found no need for changing the futures-trading system. A study by the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Options </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> reached similar conclusions.
</TEXT>
<BYLINE>National Association of Securities Dealers</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 The group that monitors the nationwide computerized network of over-the-counter trading did not study the causes of the crash but said it `` clearly revealed vulnerabilities and deficiencies in all markets.'' The <ORGANIZATION> NASD </ORGANIZATION> undertook an extensive review of trading procedures and tightened the rules for market makers in over-the-counter issues. It endorsed stricter rules for selling borrowed stocks, known as short sales, though the <ORGANIZATION> NASD </ORGANIZATION> said there was no evidence short-selling was a problem during the crash. The <ORGANIZATION> NASD </ORGANIZATION> rejected the <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> panel's proposal for marketwide `` circuit breakers.'' But it endorsed the idea of a congressionally supported study of the growth in new trading strategies and their impact.

<HEAD>Crash Study Recommendations Still Debated; Few Implemented</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By RICK GLADSTONE</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>AP Business Writer</BYLINE>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 In the year since Black Monday, government and securities industry groups have undertaken at least a dozen major studies into causes of the crash and possible safeguards to prevent another disaster. But the proposed remedies are largely technical, some are contradictory, few have been implemented, none has been written into law and chances seem increasingly remote that any will be in the foreseeable future. Moreover, critics contend, most studies have failed to confront important underlying problems and weaknesses in the nation's securities markets, such as why stocks shot up so far in the first place before crashing These critics say the recommendations made to date appear designed mainly to protect powerful interests that control the industry, such as the specialists who make markets for stocks on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, and the floor traders on the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> futures and options exchanges. Some say key issues, such as speculative abuses, the function of market makers and Wall Street's changing role in the economy, remain unresolved or ignored. `` The financial events of October 1987 will probably be remembered by our descendants as vividly as we remember the events of October 1929,'' <PERSON> Junius </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Peake </PERSON>, a capital-markets consultant and expert who has studied the crash, wrote in a recent edition of <ORGANIZATION> Investment </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Review </ORGANIZATION>. `` What will ultimately matter most, however, is whether the forensic economists and writers who issue the final autopsy report will make a correct diagnosis of the near cause of death of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> equity market.'' So far, the Black Monday inquests have caused little more than disputes and bickering. Even the <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration could n't agree on the conclusions of its own crash study headed by now-Treasury Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>, and convened a second panel that largely refuted the <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> group's recommendations The <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commodities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trading </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>, which regulate market practices, could n't agree on who should supervise stock-index futures, an exotic product that some studies linked to the wild price swings during the crash. The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>, which <PERSON> Brady </PERSON>'s group had suggested as the super-regulator of all markets, appears highly unwilling to assume that role. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, a powerful bastion of market makers, concluded that speculative selling in the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> futures pits played a crucial role in the rout. No, the <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> exchanges retorted, it was panic selling in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> that started the crash, plus the failure or unwillingness of the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> specialists to handle the flood of sell orders. Meanwhile, an emotional debate has raged about the role of computerized program trading strategies that exploit price differences between stocks and stock-index futures, sometimes causing sudden price jolts. Critics say these techniques intensified the crash and have continued to unnerve investors; defenders say they are just a scapegoat and actually help stabilize the markets by keeping stocks and futures prices from diverging. Despite the quarreling and delays in post-crash reforms, some significant progress has been made as a result of the studies, leading figures in the securities industry contend. `` All the studies have at least led to a de facto improvement, some coordination among markets,'' said <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Schreyer </PERSON>, chairman of <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` The fact they're all talking to each other, working together, has been an encouraging step.'' For example in July, the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> proposed a plan for jointly managed `` circuit breakers'' _ trading halts and price limits to discourage volatility and panic selling. The <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> also proposed altering its computer system to allow small investors speedier access to the market. Since February, the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> has enforced a so-called `` collar'' that limits computerized trading when the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrial average swings 50 points from the previous session's close. The circuit breakers, now being reviewed by federal regulators, are expected to supercede the collar after it expires on Oct. 19, the crash anniversary. In the over-the-counter market, the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dealers </ORGANIZATION> has tightened rules on its market makers, who buy and sell stocks via a nationwide computerized network. In addition, the <ORGANIZATION> NASD </ORGANIZATION> has said it will enable investors to find out if their brokers have ever been in trouble. `` Basically, it seems to me that the studies were the appropriate response as opposed to rushing in with a lot of ill-advised regulation,'' said <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Damgard </PERSON>, president of the <ORGANIZATION> Futures </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industry </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Association </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>. `` I think this administration has done the proper thing,'' <PERSON> Damgard </PERSON> said. `` They are not anxious to change any of the basic authorities. That does n't mean they do n't see the need for improvement.'' Nevertheless, others say, long-term risks to the markets would persist even with the solutions advanced so far. Opponents of trading halts and price limits, for example, contend these are cosmetic measures that could hasten a market panic. `` I think these collars and caps and circuit breakers and all that, are just devices which reduce the liquidity of the market,'' said <PERSON> Morris </PERSON> <PERSON> Mendelson </PERSON>, a finance professor at the <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pennsylvania </ORGANIZATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Wharton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> School </ORGANIZATION>. `` I'm afraid that in a pinch, they would n't work.'' Nevertheless, he said, the studies have at least helped heighten concern about the stock crash and whether it could happen again. `` Discussion is always useful. The more discussion the better,'' he said. `` One of the things I worry about is when we stop talking about it.''

 The story of last October's stock market crash featured one notorious villain: program trading. Singled out by some studies as an important ingredient in the collapse and its volatile aftermath, the high-tech strategy became a hate object for small-time investors and a target of lawmakers and market officials. The flood of criticism and scrutiny pushed the technique into the background, but program trading lives on here and is beginning to spread overseas. `` Certainly if you're looking post-crash, program trading has n't played much of a role in market activity,'' said <PERSON> Jack </PERSON> <PERSON> Barbanel </PERSON>, a futures expert at the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Gruntal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> `` But that's not to say that if Wall Street resumes momentum to the upside, the major players would not come back. In its most common form, program trading is a computerized version of arbitrage, the centuries-old practice of buying something in one market while simultaneously selling its equivalent in another market for a higher price, pocketing the difference. Program traders use computers to buy stock-index futures in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION> and sell groups of the underlying stocks in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, or vice versa, to profit from price gaps in the two markets. Critics say program trading strategies can dump tens of millions of shares of stock on exchange floors without warning, jerking prices around and sending ordinary investors fleeing for safety. Supporters of program trading say its effect on the markets is negligible. If anything, they say, program trading helps stabilize the stock and futures markets by keeping the price spread between them from widening. As a defense, they point to the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>'s own statistics, which show program trading accounted for only 8.1 percent of average daily volume in August and 10.1 percent the month earlier. In months prior to the crash, when prices were rising to record highs, program trading volume on the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> was the same percentage or less, some studies have showed. `` As far as the hysteria, it's totally unjustified,'' said <PERSON> Sanford </PERSON> <PERSON> Grossman </PERSON>, an economics professor at <ORGANIZATION> Princeton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> who has studied program trading. `` The impact of program trading is infinitesimal.'' The technique has its share of enemies nevertheless. In <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, program trading has received extraordinary review, and some legislators have been devising ways of strictly regulating the strategy because they believe it is destroying the market's health. The <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, also worried about the impact of such trading, has taken several steps to limit the technique and now requires member firms to report all program trades, both for themselves and their clients. In <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, meanwhile, down payments have been raised for stock-index futures, a crucial component of program trading, thereby making it more expensive and less profitable. Perhaps more important, investment firms that once committed large amounts of money to program trading have been forced to divert capital to other areas, partly because the crash erased much of their profits. In addition, most big firms have stated as a public relations gesture that they have curtailed program trading for their own accounts, though they'll still do it for customers. The net result, investment strategists say, has been a significant decline in the amount of program trading, although its influence occasionally is felt. Many contend the post-crash restrictions on program trading and misguided public hostility against it inevitably will drive important sources of Wall Street business overseas. Some say this already has started. The <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> market, for example, is now serving as a conduit for some U.S.-based program trading. In <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, which only recently began trading in stock-index futures, some <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> investment strategists say privately that they are looking at ways to use program trading there. Asked at a recent <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> briefing about post-crash reform whether the nation's biggest securities market is worried about this potential exodus, executive vice president <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Solodar </PERSON> was vague. `` We recognize the possibility exists, but do n't see clear evidence it's happening,'' he said. Nevertheless, he added, `` it's a threat we have to watch out for.

 Under a one-year pilot program, temporary trading halts would be triggered by pre-designated price movements. Trading on the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> would stop for an hour if the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrial average fell 250 points, and for two hours if the average fell an additional 150 points the same day. At the <ORGANIZATION> CME </ORGANIZATION>, trading would stop for an hour if the <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's 500 stock-index futures contract fell 30 points and for two hours if the <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; P contract fell another 20 points the same day. Both markets would coordinate the exact timing of the halts. In addition, if the <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; P contract fell 12 points, equivalent to a approximately a 100-point fall in the Dow average, the futures contract could not fall further for 30 minutes. At the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION>, meanwhile, computerized program trading orders would be diverted into a separate area to determine order imbalances before they could be eligible for execution. The one-year experiment would supercede an <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> restraint on program trading triggered by a 50-point move in the Dow average. The so-called `` collar'' has been in effect since February.

 The stock market crash moved across time zones like a stadium wave last October, but the recovery has proceeded unevenly around the world. `` People are still quite nervous about stock markets,'' said <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Murnaghan </PERSON>, vice president at <ORGANIZATION> Rowe </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Price-Fleming </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Baltimore </LOCATION>. Nervous enough to slow trading in most countries, but not enough to impede strong advances in some markets, particularly in <LOCATION> Asia </LOCATION>. <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulvey </PERSON>, vice president for international research at <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said volume has picked up recently on many major exchanges and he views that as a sign that `` investors are coming back to the market.'' The world's 20 major stock markets were up about 9.5 percent in late September compared with the end of October 1987, according to an index developed by a research unit of <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stanley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Co. The markets in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION>, Singapore-Malaysia and <LOCATION> Australia </LOCATION> have posted double-digit gains in local currencies since October, according to <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stanley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION>, while the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market was up 5.7 percent. The West German and British markets grew more slowly than the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> market did, according to the index, while markets in <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Norway </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION> posted small single-digit declines. The Japanese stock market, the world's largest, is up about 14 percent since the end of October, and several analysts said it was the only major market to exceed its pre-crash highs. The Nikkei stock average, a measure roughly comparable to the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrial average, surpassed its pre-crash high of 26,646.63 in April and has since risen an additional 3 percent. Japanese stocks have benefited from strong economic growth trends, particularly in manufacturing, <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Mulvey </PERSON> said. A surge in corporate profits and consumer spending has also contributed to the rise. But some analysts believe the market in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> is ripe for a fall. `` The market is so extended, at some point it has to be more reasonably valued,'' said <PERSON> Murnaghan </PERSON> of Rowe Price. <PERSON> Mark </PERSON> <PERSON> Sladkus </PERSON>, a vice president at <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stanley </ORGANIZATION>, said <LOCATION> Japanese </LOCATION> stock prices are trading at about 50 times expected earnings, over three times more than in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> at the end of August. He said the Japanese stock market has traditionally traded at big multiples of earnings, but some analysts are wary about chances that further price gains can be sustained. The markets in <LOCATION> Singapore </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Malaysia </LOCATION>, up more than 29 percent, have been spurred by strong regional growth trends, <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION>'s <PERSON> Mulvey </PERSON> said Even the <LOCATION> Hong </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kong </LOCATION> market, which closed for four days after the crash, is up 14 percent. <PERSON> Rowe </PERSON> <PERSON> Price </PERSON>'s <PERSON> Murnaghan </PERSON> said the Australian market, up nearly 25 percent, has benefited from the rise in commodity prices. The market has a heavy concentration of commodity-based businesses. But not all of the high-performing foreign markets are in the <LOCATION> Pacific </LOCATION>. The French market is up 19.8 percent and the market in <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> is up 24.5 percent from October, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stanley </ORGANIZATION> index. <PERSON> Murnaghan </PERSON> said takeover activity and strong economic fundamentals have helped the French market, while <LOCATION> Spain </LOCATION> has drawn strength from improving economic growth and progress toward reducing inflation. Both markets have been helped by speculation about the impact of the planned 1992 dismantling of many trade barriers within <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>, he said. Nonetheless, the British and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> German </LOCATION> stock markets turned in below-average performances since the crash, according to the <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stanley </ORGANIZATION> index. <PERSON> Murnaghan </PERSON> said the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Kingdom </LOCATION>'s market, up only 2.83 percent since last October, has suffered from perceptions that the economy was growing too fast, a worsening trade outlook, lower oil prices and higher interest rates. <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>'s market was up 5 percent, but has suffered because of slow growth, the high value of the West German mark and the central bank's vigilance against inflation, <PERSON> Murnaghan </PERSON> said. The Italian market is off 1.75 percent since late October. <PERSON> Mulvey </PERSON> said ongoing bank reforms there have hurt stock prices. One money manager, <PERSON> Jean-Marie </PERSON> <PERSON> Eveillard </PERSON>, who manages the <ORGANIZATION> Sogen </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, said institutional investors are showing a greater willingness to invest internationally. `` As time goes by and the equity market gets better psychologically, they are saying after all that maybe the crash was an aberration, not a warning. I'm not in that camp, ... but that is what some think.'' <PERSON> Eveillard </PERSON> has about $ 15 million of the fund's $ 108 million invested in foreign stocks, about the same ratio as in January.

<HEAD>Uncertainty Persists In Tokyo Market Despite Outstanding
Performance</HEAD>

<DATELINE>TOKYO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> stock market has outperformed most major world markets since last October's crash, but opinion is divided over whether that's a sign of strength or reason to worry. `` There are so many uncertainties underlying in today's <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> market,'' said <PERSON> Jeff </PERSON> <PERSON> Bahrenburg </PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Merrill </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lynch </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> unit. `` Though it appears to be a bull market at a glance, we have to be very cautious because any of those uncertainties could bring down the market any time.'' It only took a few months for shares on the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> to regain what they lost in the crash. Last April, the Nikkei stock average, a measure roughly comparable to the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrial average, broke its pre-crash high of 26,646.63, and now stands some 4 percent above that level, while other major markets are still struggling to recover their losses. `` The Black Monday was only a nightmare in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, and it was much more than a nightmare in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>,'' said <PERSON> Tetsuhiro </PERSON> <PERSON> Miyake </PERSON>, head of the research section of <ORGANIZATION> Nomura </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. Analysts who have confidence in the <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> market say the prosperity should continue With a total value of more than $ 3 trillion, the Japanese market is the world's largest, accounting for over 40 percent of the value of all shares traded in the world today. `` Given the current economic growth rate of about 5 percent and surging corporate earnings, the current share price level on the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> is sustainable at least until the end of the year or possibly longer,'' said <PERSON> Thomas </PERSON> <PERSON> Zengage </PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Information </ORGANIZATION>, an investment and consulting firm in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. Analysts like <PERSON> Zengage </PERSON> say <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> share prices are not as high as they appear if you take into account differences in accounting and cultural backgrounds between <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. Cautious analysts insist <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>'s triple-digit price-to-earning multiples indicate shares are at least four times overpriced compared to <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, but defenders argue the ratios does n't reflect Japanese reality. Japanese corporations tend to understate their profits by 25 to 30 percent, said <ORGANIZATION> IBI </ORGANIZATION>'s Zengage and other analysts. `` It is partially because of the steep corporate tax in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>,'' <PERSON> Zengage </PERSON> said. `` But it is also a tradition here to understate their earnings. It is simply one of those things Japanese have been doing for years and taken for granted.'' The corporate tax rate goes as high as 52 percent. Also, business relations in <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> are considered more valuable than short-term profits. Corporations commonly hold each other's stocks, not as an investment but as a testimony of their commitment to each other As a result of such crossholdings, the actual number of shares in the market is low compared with the number issued. Analysts and securities company officials say as much as 70 to 80 percent of all shares issued on the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> are locked in corporate safes for years. `` This will automatically inflate share prices because it makes the supply and demand relation heavily in favor of demand,'' <PERSON> Zengage </PERSON> said. The skyrocketing value of land, another peculiarity of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, also strengthens share prices of companies that have substantial land holdings. In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>'s main commercial district, one acre of land can cost as much as $ 1.6 billion, according to <ORGANIZATION> Land </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Agency </ORGANIZATION> statistics. `` Look closely at bullish shares,'' said <LOCATION> Miyake </LOCATION>. `` You will find most of them are attributable to the value of the land they own.'' Other analysts counter that land prices have started to decline this year and warn that this will not only reduce the value of shares but also shrink the amount investors can borrow to buy equities. `` It's a really delicate balance now,'' said <PERSON> Ronald </PERSON> <PERSON> Talmage </PERSON>, real estate specialist at <ORGANIZATION> N.M </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Rothschild </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Sons </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>, the British-based investment bank. `` I really think it's this big bubble that could burst at any time with any imbalance from one of many sectors.'' Many foreign investors and fund managers complain of the lack of transparency in the <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> market. <PERSON> Keisuke </PERSON> <PERSON> Matsuura </PERSON>, a veteran investment consultant, said many stock prices are artificially set by four major securities companies, <ORGANIZATION> Nomura </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Daiwa </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Nikko </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Yamaichi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>, who have practical control over 90 percent of shares on the exchange. `` In the Western standard, what they do here is a pure manipulation of share prices, but in the Japanese rule book, they are just traditional practices no one wonders about,'' said <PERSON> Matsuura </PERSON>. Such traditions may be reaching a turning point as a series of stock-related scandals has caused the <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION> to tighten the Securities and Exchange Law on insider trading. The increased presence of foreigners in the market also is affecting investment patterns of the Japanese, who used to regard foreign firms' market analyses as impenetrable as technical computer manuals. But now such analyses draw more attention from the newly emerging, performance-oriented private Japanese investor, said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Gerstenhaber </PERSON>, a senior analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Morgan </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stanley </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>. `` Japanese are beginning to rely less on brokers' recommendations and make their own decisions This may have a significant impact on the Japanese investment patterns in the long run,'' <PERSON> Gerstenhaber </PERSON> said. Despite concerns about overpriced shares and uncertainties created by transitions under way, many Japanese contend the <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION> market can still provide a great investment opportunity. `` There is no doubt that shares on the <ORGANIZATION> Tokyo </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> are overpriced, but so what?'' said <ORGANIZATION> Nomura </ORGANIZATION>'s <LOCATION> Miyake </LOCATION>. `` They have always been high for years, and they still have a potential for growth more than <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> or <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. This is the fact of life.''

<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The great crash of 1987 cast a giant shadow over <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s Big Bang. The collapse hit the British markets amid a wave of deregulation _ nicknamed the Big Bang _ that promised to generate an American-style boom in the securities business here. But after the crash, trading on the <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> dissolved to a trickle, and the atmosphere in the <LOCATION> City </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>'s financial district, turned from daring to cautious The crash also triggered unexpected problems for <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>'s economy And it could hamper Conservative Prime Minister <PERSON> Margaret </PERSON> <PERSON> Thatcher </PERSON>'s huge privatization program. `` People have been and still are looking over their shoulders at the dramatic impact it had and are still a little bit nervous that there could be a sort of mini-repeat of it,'' said <PERSON> Geoffrey </PERSON> <PERSON> Lederman </PERSON>, head of equities market making at the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd </ORGANIZATION>. Surprisingly, the government's opponents have n't been clamoring for increased regulation to prevent another crash, and the securities industry's system of self-regulation remains intact. During the past 12 months, the market has wandered aimlessly with a tendency to react fitfully to the release of economic reports, takeover speculation and signals from Wall Street. The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index stands about 22 percent lower than its pre-crash level of 2,301.9. An average of 489 million domestic shares were traded daily in August, down 41 percent from 825 million daily in August 1987. Investment firms have lost millions of dollars because of reduced commissions, laid off an estimated 2,250 employees and cut salaries and perks. There are some 28,000 securities industry employees among the 273,000 workers in the City. It has been an especially rude awakening for firms that prepared for Big Bang by diversifying and increasing staff at huge salaries. `` It was a sort of a Catch-22 situation. Before Big Bang one had to get into the act and become a serious player,'' <PERSON> Lederman </PERSON> said. `` Now there are far too many players. There will have to be some further reduction ...'' In the months before the crash, the fierce competition already was forcing a shakeout. Americans, more used to such competition, had been expected to do particularly well in post-Big Bang <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> banks, such as <ORGANIZATION> Citibank </ORGANIZATION>, were eager to take advantage of a freedom not yet won in their own country to engage in the securities business. But the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies found it `` like learning to sail in a hurricane,'' one unidentified bank official said in a <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government report on the subject. The impact of the crash on the British economy has confounded experts who predicted a slowdown in consumer spending, which would hobble economic growth. The British government, like others which feared a recession, cut interest rates, and that increased spending. Economic growth expanded to 4 percent, annual inflation rose to 5.7 percent by August, and the country's trade deficit skyrocketed. `` The effect of that was to stimulate the <LOCATION> U.K. </LOCATION> economy when it was growing already,'' said <PERSON> David </PERSON> <PERSON> Owen </PERSON>, an economist with the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Kleinwort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Grieveson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd </ORGANIZATION>. The government has reacted to this `` overheating'' by pushing up base interest rates 4.5 percentage points since June to 12 percent, and that worries investors and homeowners, alike. The <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> insists the privatization program remains on schedule and says the next sale, of <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Steel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, will take place at yearend. But many analysts believe Britons will now be less keen to buy. The government has sold off billions of dollars' worth of state-owned companies and the public has bought the shares eagerly over the years. But the last sale, of the government's one-third stake in <ORGANIZATION> British </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. PLC, coincided with the crash, and flopped, leaving most of $ 12 billion worth of stock in the underwriters' Looking ahead, the experts are divided about the overall market's direction. <PERSON> Kevin </PERSON> <PERSON> Gardiner </PERSON>, a British economist at the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> investment firm <ORGANIZATION> Warburg </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION>, predicted a significant rally within four months, based on strong corporate profits. But <PERSON> Lederman </PERSON> said the market `` will jog gently downwards for the next year or so. If the economic news does get worse, then again, people will just not invest.''

<HEAD>Scrutiny Of Futures, Options Has Strengthened Markets, Officials
Say</HEAD>

<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 The finger-pointing began on the morning after, with a Wall Street Journal article that traced the stock market's collapse to the <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's 500 stock-index futures pit at the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> `` The panic began here,'' was the lead on the Oct. 20, 1987, story, which was headlined: `` <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s ` Shadow Markets' Led Free Fall In A Plunge That Began Right At Opening.'' The Journal did n't blame the index futures market for the shocking, 508-point drop in the Dow Jones industrial average. But many others did, contending that the relatively low cost of futures compared with the potential gains invited reckless speculation. Sophisticated `` program trading'' techniques that use computers to trade huge amounts of stocks, stock-index futures and stock-index options were scrutinized and criticized. Former Treasury Secretary <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Regan </PERSON> even urged <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in May to force a halt to all trading of stock-index futures. A year after the crash, index futures and their even more esoteric cousins, index options, still are traded and new versions are planned. But trading volume is off sharply from the pre-crash days and no one is predicting a return soon to volume levels approaching those of the first three quarters of 1987. An index future is a contract to buy or sell, at a specified time and price, a basket of stocks represented by a recognized index. An index option is a right _ not a contractual obligation _ to buy or sell the stocks. Stock-market investors use futures and options to hedge against adverse moves in the stock market. Speculators play the stock, futures and options markets in hopes of profiting from the constantly changing prices of all three. The <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; P 500 contract is the world's leading index future. The <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Options </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; P 100 index option contract is the most popular product of its type The Merc met some of the criticism of index futures by imposing limits on the daily movement of prices and increasing the speculative margin _ the amount of money speculators must put down as a performance bond _ from about 6 percent to 15 percent of the contract's face value. Officials say those changes, plus the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>'s `` collar'' on program trading, have cut both volume and volatility in the index-futures market The collar is scheduled to expire on Oct. 19 and be replaced by a series of `` circuit breakers'' _ coordinated trading halts between the <ORGANIZATION> NYSE </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Leo </PERSON> <PERSON> Melamed </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION>'s executive committee, said the spotlight that shone on <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>'s markets after the crash illuminated their importance to modern financial management. `` It started with a lot of finger-pointing and knee-jerk reactions based on a great deal of misconception and misunderstanding,'' <PERSON> Melamed </PERSON> said. The futures-options industry responded with `` a major educational offensive,'' he said, in which `` we were able to present not just our case, but a whole learning process to people in finance and within government who otherwise would never have had the need, time or inclination to go through that learning curve.'' Alger B. `` Duke'' <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON>, chairman of the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Options </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, said it was `` inevitable,'' even before the crash, that index options would receive closer attention. `` A lot of people were saying all along that these -LRB- stocks, futures and options -RRB- are one market with different pieces. I have no problem with that focus,'' he said. Average daily trading volume in the <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; P 500 stock-index future was down about 41 percent during the first eight months of this year compared with the same period in 1987. On average, about 47,000 S & amp; P 500 contracts changed hands each trading day from January through August of this year compared with 80,000 per day during the first eight months of 1987. But <PERSON> Melamed </PERSON> said overall volume at the <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION> was down only 7 percent, with most of the slack in the index-futures pit offset by increased trading volume in Eurodollar and foreign currency futures. The <ORGANIZATION> CBOE </ORGANIZATION>, which has a less diverse mix of products than the <ORGANIZATION> Merc </ORGANIZATION>, has suffered much more. Overall trading volume was down 44 percent in the first eight months of this year, with trading in <ORGANIZATION> S </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; P 100 index options off about 48 percent. Despite a 10 percent staff reduction, <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON> said the <ORGANIZATION> CBOE </ORGANIZATION> had net income of less than $ 500,000 for the fiscal year ended June 30, compared with a profit of $ 9.6 million in fiscal 1987. In addition to those problems, the <ORGANIZATION> CBOE </ORGANIZATION> also faces a class-action lawsuit claiming the exchange and some of its traders are liable for $ 40 million in losses sustained by investors on Oct. 20, 1987, as financial markets reeled in the wake of the crash. The <ORGANIZATION> CBOE </ORGANIZATION> says the lawsuit should be dismissed. <PERSON> Chapman </PERSON> said trading volume was slowly rebuilding as part of `` the normal healing process that comes after a major market correction.'' But <PERSON> Melamed </PERSON> said the limits and linkages that have been placed on stocks and stock-index futures since the collapse can not ensure that investors will return to the financial markets. `` Investor confidence is not going to come back because we agree to better coordination of market mechanisms, and we have. Investor confidence is not going to come back because there's less volatility in the market, and there is,'' he said. `` It is the macroeconomic, geopolitical issues _ foreign exchange rates, interest rates, inflation, trade deficits _ that bring confidence to the financial community,'' <PERSON> Melamed </PERSON> said.

<HEAD>Crop Futures Open Slightly Lower</HEAD>
<DATELINE>CHICAGO (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 Most futures prices of grain and soybeans opened slightly lower today on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>, pressured by selling linked to the advancing corn and soybean harvest. Harvest pressure remains the dominant force in the crop futures market, overshadowing an increase in foreign demand for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> grain and soybeans, analysts said. The <ORGANIZATION> Agriculture </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> said late Wednesday that the <LOCATION> Soviet </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Union </LOCATION> had purchased another 250,000 metric tons of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> corn, while <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Taiwan </LOCATION> were awaiting word today on their bids for <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> soybeans. Wheat futures prices retreated on news that the <ORGANIZATION> USDA </ORGANIZATION> had rejected <LOCATION> Egypt </LOCATION>'s bid for 40,000 metric tons of subsidized <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> wheat under the Export Enhancement Program. Rejections of <ORGANIZATION> EEP </ORGANIZATION> wheat tenders have grown more frequent, and rightly so, said grain specialist <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Mao </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` Why keep promoting exports of a commodity that, if we have dry weather again next year, we could have a shortage of?'' he said. In early trading, wheat was \ cent to 1 -LCB- cents lower with the contract for delivery in December at $ 4.15 a bushel; corn was unchanged to -RCB- cent lower with December at $ 2.86 -LCB- a bushel; oats were -LCB- cent to 1 cent lower with December at $ 2.45 a bushel; soybeans were 4 cents lower to 5 cents higher with November at $ 8.10 a bushel. Cattle futures were mixed while pork futures were higher in early trading on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. Live cattle were .20 cent lower to .02 cent higher with October at 71.22 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .22 cent lower to .28 cent higher with September at 80.20 cents a pound; live hogs were .17 cent to .55 cent higher with October at 39.22 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .13 cent to .33 cent higher with February at 49.20 cents a pound. Cattle futures closed mixed on Wednesday while pork futures ended lower.

 The stock market rallied today, bidding to break its recent stalemate. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials climbed 18.49 points to 2,104.02 by noontime on Wall Street. Gainers outnumbered losers by more than 2 to 1 in the overall tally of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 830 up, 391 down and 531 unchanged. Analysts said there was nothing in the news to stir up much buying interest. However, they said, it appeared some traders were nibbling at stocks this morning simply because the market has n't sold off lately despite a long list of worries and uncertainties. Among those problems are the approaching first anniversary of Black Monday on Oct. 19, which is presumed to be casting a pall over the market. In addition, investors are said to be reluctant to commit themselves before they can get a clearer idea of where government economic policy is headed after the election of a new president. Nevertheless, brokers said money managers at some investing institutions seemed interested in adding stocks to their portfolios before they make reports to their clients for the third quarter, which ends with Friday's session. Gainers in the blue-chip sector included <ORGANIZATION> Coca-Cola </ORGANIZATION>, up ~ at 44 -LRB-; <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Business </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Machines </ORGANIZATION>, up -LCB- at 114 -RRB-; <ORGANIZATION> Philip </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Morris </ORGANIZATION>, up ~ at 96 ~, and <ORGANIZATION> Union </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Carbide </ORGANIZATION>, up \ at 24 <ORGANIZATION> C3 </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> jumped 2 -LRB- to 13 \ <ORGANIZATION> Knoll </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Capital </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Management </ORGANIZATION> said it proposed to acquire C3 for $ 13 a share, and might raise the offer if the company provides it with information that warrants a higher price.

 A federal judge overseeing the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION>'s civil fraud case against <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> temporarily has blocked defense requests to interview potential witnesses the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> may use. <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> District Judge <PERSON> Milton </PERSON> <PERSON> Pollack </PERSON>'s order, issued Wednesday, was not unexpected because <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> lawyers in other civil suits against <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> and defense attorneys have so far failed to agree on a common structure for the preliminary fact-finding process, known as discovery, that takes place before trial. The order means that at least for the immediate future, attorneys for the Wall Street firm and other defendants in the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> case, notably <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>'s high-yield bond financier <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Milken </PERSON>, can not compel pretrial testimony from any prospective government witnesses. The most important of these witnesses is <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> F. </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>, the imprisoned former takeover speculator who has provided much of the information the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> used to accuse <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> and <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> on Sept. 7 of widespread securities fraud. The defendants have denied the charges and vowed to fight them in court. <PERSON> Pollack </PERSON> gave no indication when he would end the restriction, but his order still allows defense attorneys to start reviewing sensitive documents that the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> also used to draft its charges. He also ordered a conference of attorneys Nov. 10 to set a date for the start of pretrial witness interviews, known as depositions. Defense lawyers have expressed unhappiness that <PERSON> Pollack </PERSON> has charge of the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> case because they believe he is biased in the government's favor. Their pretrial maneuvering has included requests that <PERSON> Pollack </PERSON> disqualify himself. The 81-year-old judge so far has given no indication he will surrender the case, although a defense-requested hearing on the matter is set for Oct. 11. After a nearly two-year investigation, the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> alleged that <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> and others secretly schemed with <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON> to trade on inside information, manipulate stock, cheat <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> clients and commit other frauds. The <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> attorney's office also has been conducting an inquiry into <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION>'s activities and there has been increasing speculation criminal charges will be filed within the next few months.

<HEAD>Asher Edelman: An American Raider in Paris</HEAD>

<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <PERSON> Asher </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Edelman </PERSON> is about to become an American raider in <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION>. With profitable runs on major companies like <ORGANIZATION> Lucky </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stores </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Fruehauf </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> under his belt, <PERSON> Edelman </PERSON> said in a rare interview this week that he plans to transplant part of his investment business overseas, where the takeover environment is less hostile to the hostile. Despairing over the high prices of <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies and the legal roadblocks that impede the swift stroke of the raider's hand, <PERSON> Edelman </PERSON> said he's looking to become `` very, very active in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>.'' For at least six months a year, the 48-year-old <PERSON> Edelman </PERSON> plans to make camp in his computer-equipped <LOCATION> Paris </LOCATION> apartment and work through a holding company. The Edelman Companies, a menagerie of trading operations and limited partnerships, will continue to operate in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. Perhaps to prepare the takeover canvas he intends to paint, <PERSON> Edelman </PERSON> recently bought a 5 percent stake in the British conglomerate <ORGANIZATION> Lonrho </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> PLC </ORGANIZATION>. The foreign press, relatively unacquainted with brash, American-style dealmakers, has been humming over just what he's up to and why he would want the company, whose most valuable assets include the Metropole and Princess hotel chains in <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Acapulco </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Bermuda </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> Bahamas </LOCATION>, as well as African gold fields. The eccentric art collector who's admittedly more comfortable in the company of ballerinas than bankers is rumored to be courting other large <ORGANIZATION> Lonrho </ORGANIZATION> shareholders. <PERSON> Edelman </PERSON> had no comment but notes `` there's been no bid.'' <PERSON> Edelman </PERSON>'s personal wealth is estimated at about $ 100 million, and he is believed to have amassed a warchest for takeovers five times that amount. Hence, <ORGANIZATION> Lonrho </ORGANIZATION> Chief Executive Tiny <PERSON> Rowland </PERSON> said: `` We are taking him very seriously.'' Lonrho aside, <PERSON> Edelman </PERSON> has warm words for the Continent. First off, the Common Market lacks the tremendous deficits that the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> shoulders. And <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> already has emerged successfully from what <PERSON> Edelman </PERSON> calls `` a social revolution'' that is only in its embryonic stages here. He notes that `` European businesses already have faced up to their social responsibilities,'' like kicking in for employees' medical benefits, something that many American companies have n't been forced to Trade barriers are softening, and European companies have an increasingly urgent need to expand their share of what in 1992 officially will become a single, unified market of more than 300 million people. `` For all of this to work, European companies have to merge, they have to consolidate, they have to go across borders,'' said <PERSON> Edelman </PERSON>, relaxing in his art-bedecked office. He also believes European companies are less expensive and relatively unencumbered by anti-takeover devices like poison pills. Shareholders, he says gleefully, `` have ultimate power over the company.'' <PERSON> Edelman </PERSON> is no stranger to <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>. Fluent in French, he spent four years running the French and Belgian operations of the investment firm <PERSON> Carter </PERSON>, <ORGANIZATION> Berlind </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; <PERSON> Weill </PERSON>. He holidays overseas several months a year, this summer piloting his yacht through the <LOCATION> Mediterranean </LOCATION> to visit archaeological digs. The decision to focus more exclusively on <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> came after his unsuccessful bid for <ORGANIZATION> Burlington </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> last year Though he reaped an estimated $ 60 million, <PERSON> Edelman </PERSON> said the deal degenerated into a `` horrendous'' and `` saddening'' exchange, punctuated by accusations that he and his partner, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Dominion </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Textile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, had received inside information from a former <LOCATION> Burlington </LOCATION> employee Ultimately <LOCATION> Burlington </LOCATION> was taken private, assuming $ 3 billion in debt in the process. Spokesman <PERSON> Bryant </PERSON> <PERSON> Haskins </PERSON> said the resulting string of staff reductions and asset sales `` was like curing an in-grown toenail by cutting off a leg. `` We are still not too happy with Mr. <PERSON> Edelman </PERSON>. We felt that being put into play in a hostile takeover attempt allegedly using inside information was certainly not the way to go about acquiring a company,'' he said. For <PERSON> Edelman </PERSON>, the incident convinced him that `` there were just too many legal hassles and not enough economic substance to getting deals done'' here. Raised on <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>'s manicured south shore, <PERSON> Edelman </PERSON> earned a degree in economics at <ORGANIZATION> Bard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> College </ORGANIZATION> and then moved into the brokerage business. In 1969 he went out on his own, changing course over the years from brokering to arbitrage to takeovers while posting an average net return of 30 percent annually for his fewer than 100 well-heeled clients. <PERSON> Edelman </PERSON> not only has challenged the corporate status quo but the academic status quo as well. Last year, while teaching a course at <ORGANIZATION> Columbia </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> entitled `` Corporate Raiding: The Art of War,'' <PERSON> Edelman </PERSON> offered a $ 100,000 `` finder's fee'' to any student who spotted a takeover target. <LOCATION> Columbia </LOCATION>, irked that he would have students do his legwork, forced him to withdraw the offer. But according to <PERSON> Larry </PERSON> <PERSON> Barth </PERSON>, a student in the class, <PERSON> Edelman </PERSON> `` had no problem mixing academia with cash incentives.'' On Wall Street, <PERSON> Edelman </PERSON> is held in varying degrees of esteem. `` Probably in general people have not made a lot of money with <PERSON> Asher </PERSON> like they have with <PERSON> Carl </PERSON> <PERSON> Icahn </PERSON> or <PERSON> Boone </PERSON> <PERSON> Pickens </PERSON>,'' said one arbitrager, whose job it is to follow the dealmakers in betting on takeover stocks. `` He's out there for himself, and if you want to come along, that's dandy, but it's caveat emptor,'' said the dealer who spoke on condition of anonymity. The string of companies that lies in <PERSON> Edelman </PERSON>'s wake is lengthy. Fruehauf fended him off in 1986 in a leveraged buyout that resulted in divestitures and an $ 80 million net loss for the year. And Foster <ORGANIZATION> Wheeler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> charged in court last year that <PERSON> Edelman </PERSON> and his associates manipulated the company's stock in a takeover bid. Although he won <ORGANIZATION> Ponderosa </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Edelman </PERSON> sold out at no profit after cutting overhead and employees. He contends the companies he's touched are more efficient after such changes. No one can call <PERSON> Edelman </PERSON> a `` typical'' businessman. He brands himself _ emphatically so _ as `` avante garde'' and ranks his interests pyramid style with family at the top, followed by the arts, the community and business, which is conspicuously last. <PERSON> Edelman </PERSON> has hand-picked an impressive art collection and spends at least a full day each week gallery-hopping, sometimes in his chauffeur-driven Jeep. Swerving through the curved corridors of his office, a visitor comes upon a secretary working near a large piece of squashed metal. `` It's a Chamberlain,'' she sighs, referring its creator, <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Chamberlain </PERSON>. Within his 15-room <LOCATION> Manhattan </LOCATION> apartment, objects d'arte are not confined to a 57-foot gallery. Indeed, a metal sculpture is suspended above the dining room table _ another <PERSON> Chamberlain </PERSON>. Recently his eye has strayed from contemporary works to antiquities and European art of the 1940s, 1950s and 1960s. As testament to his diversity, a second-century sculpture of a Roman emperor has replaced two, 500-pound boxes by <PERSON> Donald </PERSON> <PERSON> Judd </PERSON>, now on loan to the <LOCATION> Whitney </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Museum </LOCATION>. `` He has a real sincere interest in the arts,'' said one former business associate. `` He's more interesting than many people give him credit for and can certainly be provocative. I like the fact that he has these pretentions.''

 The stock market ran up a broad gain today, bidding to break its recent stalemate. The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials climbed 22.93 points to 2,106.46 by 2 p.m. on Wall Street. Gainers outnumbered losers by more than 2 to 1 in the overall tally of New York Stock Exchange-listed issues, with 938 up, 394 down and 529 unchanged. Analysts said there was nothing in the news to stir up much buying interest. However, they said, it appeared some traders were bidding for stocks simply because the market has n't sold off lately despite a long list of worries and uncertainties. Among those problems are the approaching first anniversary of Black Monday on Oct. 19, which is presumed to be casting a pall over the market. In addition, investors are said to be reluctant to commit themselves before they can get a clearer idea of where government economic policy is headed after the election of a new president. Nevertheless, brokers said money managers at some investing institutions seemed interested in adding stocks to their portfolios before they make reports to their clients for the third quarter, which ends with Friday's session.

 Share prices surged late in the session to end stronger Thursday on the <ORGANIZATION> London </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, boosted by a healthy start on Wall Street and continued takeover speculation affecting particular stocks. The Financial Times-Stock Exchange 100-share index ended 16.5 points, or 0.9 percent, higher at 1,829. Volume was relatively strong as 562.2 million shares changed hands, up from 418.3 million shares traded Wednesday. The increased turnover led to market talk that a significant computer-generated buying program had been carried out in the morning, but there was no confirmation of this. On Wall Street, the <ORGANIZATION> Dow </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jones </ORGANIZATION> industrial average surged 18.85 points higher to 2,104.37 as <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> trading tapered off. Dealers said <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> shares were pulled higher by Wall Street's confident movements Several market watchers suggested that <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> equities could advance still further if the <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> market could sustain the 2,100 level over the next few trading sessions. Dealers said the tone of the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> market has felt positive since Tuesday's release of better-than-expected British trade figures for August. With a handful of leading stocks in the 100-share index still considered prime takeover bid candidates, the market is unlikely to come under much selling pressure in the short term, analysts said.

 <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> is moving to the center of the world financial stage, stepping into a leadership role temporarily vacated by <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> preoccupation with the presidential campaign. `` Never before have I seen so many people saying, ` <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>,''' <PERSON> Satoshi </PERSON> <PERSON> Sumita </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s central bank governor, told reporters at this week's annual meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> captured the attention of thousands of top financial officials and bankers meeting in <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION> with an offer to help ease one of the world's most serious problems _ the $ 1.2 trillion Third World debt. It also suggested that the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> dollar, the world's leading currency, be given less weight in the holdings that governments keep in their coffers. The implication was that <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> would like to see its own currency, the yen, take on greater importance in international financial transactions. A high-ranking official of the <ORGANIZATION> Japanese </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Finance </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ministry </ORGANIZATION>, speaking on condition of anonymity, confessed to Japanese reporters, `` <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s presence was so powerful that I almost felt frightened.'' The <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> role at the meeting was diminished by an uncertain dollar, high trade and budget deficits and preoccupation with the November presidential election. Economists said it was about time <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, the world's No. 2 economic power after the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, exerted more influence. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> Williamson </PERSON>, a senior fellow at the <ORGANIZATION> Institute </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Economics </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, said, `` People have been anticipating a more active Japanese role for 10 or 15 years. Up to now, they've always remained almost deferential.'' <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s more visible performance likely stems from its ability to successfully manage its economy and reduce its heavy dependence on sales of export goods, economists said. `` It's a sign of self-confidence ... They feel they've been most successful,'' said <PERSON> Tim </PERSON> <PERSON> O'Dell </PERSON>, an international economist at the <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> brokerage firm <ORGANIZATION> Phillips </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Drew. <PERSON> Williamson </PERSON> agreed, `` It stems from their macro-economic success in showing they are not dependent on exports.'' <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> had long relied on sales of goods to foreign countries to drive its economy. But analysts say in the last year it has been able to promote growth based on domestic demand. At the same time, the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> has been criticized for failing to correct its federal budget and trade deficits, which foreign officials fear will derail the world economic expansion. The dollar has lost some of its luster, although it has been gaining strength in recent months. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and its major trading partners had agreed three years ago to devalue the dollar to narrow the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> trade gap and stave off protectionist sentiment in <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION>. A weaker dollar makes American products more competitive on overseas markets while making imports more expensive in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. The Japanese chose this week's meeting, the largest annual gathering of financial brass, to make their move, five weeks before the presidential election when the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> focus is at home. <PERSON> O'Dell </PERSON> said the Japanese used the `` hiatus'' of the presidential campaign `` to take the opportunity to increase their presence.'' Newly installed <ORGANIZATION> Treasury </ORGANIZATION> Secretary <PERSON> Nicholas </PERSON> <PERSON> Brady </PERSON> kept a low profile at the meeting, unlike his predecessor, <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Baker </PERSON> <PERSON> III </PERSON>. <PERSON> Baker </PERSON>, who resigned as treasury chief to head the presidential campaign of Vice President <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Bush </PERSON>, was a powerful force in international financial affairs. He was credited with fashioning in 1985 the industrial countries' strategy for dealing with the Third World debt problem. The `` Baker Plan'' calls in part for providing new loans to developing countries that enact economic liberalization policies. Top finance leaders chose this week not to change course. They agreed to maintain stable financial markets and supported the current debt strategy. Still, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> persisted. It offered a new way to ease the money woes of big debtors, like <LOCATION> Brazil </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Mexico </LOCATION>, which have combined debts of $ 220 billion. Finance Minister <PERSON> Kiichi </PERSON> <PERSON> Miyazawa </PERSON> floated the idea in June at the <LOCATION> Toronto </LOCATION> economic summit attended by seven key world leaders. It drew little support but prompted interest. <PERSON> Sumita </PERSON> fleshed out the plan, under which some of the countries' foreign debts would be converted into bonds Interest on the bonds would be backed by money the debtors deposited in escrow accounts with the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Sumita </PERSON> also said the Japanese <ORGANIZATION> Export-Import </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> was willing to make additional loans through the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> to debtor countries. World Bank President <PERSON> Barber </PERSON> <PERSON> Conable </PERSON> called the Japanese `` outward looking.'' They tend, he said, `` to view -LRB- economic -RRB- development financing in a much more favorable light than many other developed nations,'' he said.

 Internationally known activists ended a mock trial of the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday with a `` verdict'' that the organizations perpetuate poverty in heavily indebted Third World nations. The `` Permanent People's Tribunal'' said <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> figures show that `` 350 million people live in absolute poverty'' throughout the world and that `` the majority of humankind is worse off now than 10 years ago.'' The tribunal urged the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> to arrange an international conference on the Third World debt crisis and called for a `` widespread write-off of the debt.'' The three-day `` trial'' was staged as <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> delegates held their annual joint meeting in another part of <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>. Several renown activists participated in the mock trial, including Americans <PERSON> George </PERSON> <PERSON> Wald </PERSON>, who shared the 1967 Nobel Prize in Physiology or Medicine, author <PERSON> Cheryl </PERSON> <PERSON> Payer </PERSON> and sociologist <PERSON> Susan </PERSON> <PERSON> George </PERSON>. The tribunal said the flow of resources out of poor countries to richer ones is steadily increasing to pay off enormous debts, a situation it called `` profoundly unjust and -LRB- an -RRB- affront to every reasonable and humane person.'' As a result, the tribunal said, `` in places where a decade ago there were primary schools and medical centers, no education or health care is now provided. In such places, people have lost hope.'' In a speech ending the proceedings, novelist <PERSON> Eduardo </PERSON> <PERSON> Galeano </PERSON> of <LOCATION> Uruguay </LOCATION> denounced the economic policies of the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> and other major industrial nations toward poor countries. He charged that conditions attached to financial aid offered to heavily indebted Third World countries have crippled those lands. `` The international finance police have a tight hold on everything ... except sunshine and rainfall,'' <PERSON> Galeano </PERSON> said, sparking applause from most of the 300 people in the audience at <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Berlin </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Free </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION>. `` The more they -LRB- people in those countries -RRB- pay, the more they owe. They have to work longer to have less and less,'' <PERSON> Galeano </PERSON> said. Meanwhile, he charged, `` The great bankers of the world ... possess more wealth than kings'' In its `` verdict,'' the tribunal said the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> have breached `` the Charter of the <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Nations </ORGANIZATION> in that they have not prompted higher standards of living, full employment and conditions of economic and social progress and development'' in poor countries. The <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> has fashioned rescue packages to help financially troubled Third World countries; the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> provides them with aid for economic development. The tribunal said the monetary policies of <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION> are at least partly responsible for Third World poverty. The <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>, the statement said, has contributed to the `` degradation of financial markets through its huge borrowing to cover its military expenditures without levying more taxes on its own population.'' Analysts say the large federal budget deficit in the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> keeps interest rates higher, attracting savings from foreigners anxious to earn more money on their investments. <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, the tribunal charged, are using `` their own surpluses to finance the American deficit instead of transferring resources to Third World countries.'' Both the bank and the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> declined requests to send representatives to the trial, saying they have their own institutional control mechanisms to monitor their operations. When told about the verdict, <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> President <PERSON> Barber </PERSON> <PERSON> Conable </PERSON> replied: `` That's life.'' During the World Bank-IMF talks, the Third World debt problem was one of the key topics of discussion. Financial officials from poor countries urged the rich nations to do more to ease their burdens. The <ORGANIZATION> Permanent </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> People </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> 's </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Tribunal </ORGANIZATION> is part of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Basso </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foundation </ORGANIZATION>, a Rome-based human rights organization founded by <PERSON> Lelio </PERSON> <PERSON> Basso </PERSON>, an Italian political activist who died in 1978.

 The head of the <ORGANIZATION> International </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Monetary </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fund </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday praised the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> for its help in renewing efforts to stabilize world currency exchange markets. As the annual meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> ended, <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> chief <PERSON> Michel </PERSON> <PERSON> Camdessus </PERSON> cited <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> support for cooperation among the seven major industrial countries in sustaining income growth and money rates. The so-called Group of Seven includes <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Britain </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> France </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Italy </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Canada </LOCATION> and the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION>. <PERSON> Camdessus </PERSON> said he also agreed with the <LOCATION> United </LOCATION> <LOCATION> States </LOCATION> that the strategy for dealing with the Third World's $ 1.2 billion debt should be flexible. He and representatives of the major industrial countries have insisted that debt reduction be done a case-by-case basis. `` I am quite happy with the support,'' <PERSON> Camdessus </PERSON> said. There have been reports of a rift earlier in the meeting between the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government and the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> over loans offered by the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> to <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION>, before <LOCATION> Argentina </LOCATION> entered into a separate arrangement with the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION>. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has supported the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> loans. But <PERSON> Camdessus </PERSON> and <PERSON> Barber </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Conable </PERSON>, the American who is president of the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>, both said Thursday that they had consulted each other on the Argentine loans. The <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> chief defended the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> administration against criticism that it is falling behind on plans to increase contributions from member governments. A decision is due April 30. Such a plan would enable the fund to expand lending to Third World countries in return for promises of policy changes by borrower governments so that they will be better able to repay. The <PERSON> Reagan </PERSON> administration has used its influence to delay the decision so that it did not have to ask <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> in the same year for a contribution to both the <ORGANIZATION> IMF </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Congress </ORGANIZATION> is now considering the <ORGANIZATION> World </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> contribution. <PERSON> Conable </PERSON> said the new capital will help the bank to increase its lending to $ 25 billion a year in 1992. It now lends about $ 17 billion annually and is a major source of loans aimed at raising Third World living standards. In his closing remarks, <PERSON> Camdessus </PERSON> said he sensed broad agreement on where the world needs to go. `` The world economy is moving on the right track,'' he said.

 The stock market staged a broad advance today, showing signs of life after the stalemate of the past several weeks. Analysts said there was no single development in the news to `` explain'' the rally. However, they said, it appeared some traders were bidding for stocks simply because the market has n't sold off lately despite a long list of worries and uncertainties. Among those problems are the approaching first anniversary of Black Monday on Oct. 19, which is presumed to be casting a pall over the market. In addition, investors are said to be reluctant to commit themselves before they can get a clearer idea of where government economic policy is headed after the election of a new president. Nevertheless, brokers said money managers at some investing institutions seemed interested in adding stocks to their portfolios before they make reports to their clients for the third quarter, which ends with Friday's session. `` The market has been lifeless for so long. It started to move up, and gave traders a sense of direction,'' said <PERSON> Hugh </PERSON> <PERSON> Johnson </PERSON> at <ORGANIZATION> First </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Albany </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Albany </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION> `` After that they jumped on board, with a little encouragement from the bond market.''

<TEXT>
 Futures prices of grain and soybeans posted modest losses Thursday on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>, reflecting selling linked to the accelerating harvest and disappointment in the lack of significant export business. Corn prices also were pressured by ideas that the government will relax its corn planting restrictions in the 1989 price-support program in a move to replenish supplies thinned by this summer's drought, said <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Mao </PERSON>, grain specialist in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> with <ORGANIZATION> Shearson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lehman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Hutton </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` Maybe people are reacting to the fact that they know the set-aside program wo n't be as stringent next year,'' he said `` The government will try to put back some of the acreage that was taken out this year.'' The Midwestern corn and soybean harvest continued to dominate the market, pushing prices lower on concerns about new supplies coming to market. At the close, wheat was 3 cents to 5 cents lower with the contract for delivery in December at $ 4.13 a bushel; corn was unchanged to 7 -RCB- cents lower with December at $ 2.86 -LCB- a bushel; oats were 3 -LCB- cents to 4 cents lower with December at $ 2.41 -LCB- a bushel; soybeans were 4 -LCB- cents to 9 cents lower with November at $ 8.08 a bushel.

<HEAD>Firm Allegedly Subjected to Boesky Stock Parking Scam Gets
Takeover Offer</HEAD>
<DATELINE>NEW YORK (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Fischbach </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION>, a leading electrical contractor once targeted in an alleged stock parking scheme involving <PERSON> Ivan </PERSON> <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>, <PERSON> Victor </PERSON> <PERSON> Posner </PERSON> and <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Burnham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Lambert </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, received a $ 98 million cash takeover offer Thursday from the head of a real parking company. An investor group led by <PERSON> Andrew </PERSON> <PERSON> N. </PERSON> <PERSON> Heine </PERSON>, chairman and chief executive officer of the national car-parking company <ORGANIZATION> Kinney </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> System </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, said in a brief statement that it offered $ 25 a share for each of <PERSON> Fischbach </PERSON>'s approximately 3.91 million common shares. <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Wilinski </PERSON>, <PERSON> Fischbach </PERSON> executive vice president, said he had no comment on the offer. The announcement caused <PERSON> Fischbach </PERSON>'s stock to surge $ 2.87 -LCB- a share to $ 17.50 on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Fischbach </PERSON>, one of the nation's largest electrical contractors, drew prominent attention in April 1987 because it was identified by the federal government as the object of a criminal conspiracy described in a guilty plea by <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>, the former stock speculator now serving a three-year prison term. The conspiracy concerned stock parking, a fraudulent practice in which the ownership of stock is disguised in someone else's name. Stock parking can be used to avoid reporting requirements to the <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Commission </ORGANIZATION> and to quietly accumulate stock for hostile takeovers. Earlier this month, the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> alleged as part of a massive securities fraud complaint against <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> that its high-yield bond chief <PERSON> Michael </PERSON> <PERSON> Milken </PERSON> and <PERSON> Posner </PERSON>, a <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION> industrialist, were co-conspirators in the Fischbach stock-parking arrangement with <PERSON> Boesky </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> said the alleged arrangement enabled <PERSON> Posner </PERSON> to ultimately acquire a controlling interest in <PERSON> Fischbach </PERSON> and become chairman. The defendants in the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> case have denied the accusations. In a telephone interview, <PERSON> Heine </PERSON> called his offer friendly and unsolicited. He also said the offer and its timing were unrelated to the <ORGANIZATION> SEC </ORGANIZATION> case against <ORGANIZATION> Drexel </ORGANIZATION> and the others, but `` obviously, we're aware of all that.'' <PERSON> Heine </PERSON> declined to identify his associates in the takeover offer but said it had nothing to do with <PERSON> Kinney </PERSON>, which he once helped acquire via a leveraged buyout, a transaction in which buyers use borrowed money and repay it with the acquired company's assets or earnings. He said the <PERSON> Fischbach </PERSON> transaction also would be structured as a leveraged buyout but declined to specify if he would sell any of the company's assets to finance it. `` I really do n't want to go into a game plan at this time,'' he said. Based in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Fischbach </PERSON> has about 80 offices and 9,000 employees nationwide. It earned about $ 36 million on revenue of $ 1.1 billion last year.

<HEAD>Top Officers at Winnebago Resign</HEAD>
<DATELINE>FOREST CITY, Iowa (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Winnebago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industries </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>'s two top operating officers have resigned from the recreational vehicle manufacturer, replaced by a seven-member management council. Stepping aside were <PERSON> Gerald </PERSON> <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON>, president and chief executive officer, and <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Berreth </PERSON>, executive vice president. The two resigned Wednesday and the company announced the change Thursday. In a prepared statement, the company did not elaborate on why the two top officers had quit. <PERSON> Berreth </PERSON>, 52, implied that company directors were n't satisfied with the firm's growth in recent months, although he declined to be specific. He said he was disappointed with having to resign but that he had only good things to say about the company. `` From my standpoint, it's an excellent company with an excellent product line and a good group of people. I would prefer to let the company speak for itself -LRB- on the shakeup -RRB-. I'm certainly disappointed in not being with the team but I certainly wish them the best of luck,'' he said in a telephone interview from his home. `` I'm going to take 30 days and do a little fishing, a little hunting and decide what I'm going to do when I grow up. I want to make it clear I'm not throwing mud at the company,'' he said. Attempts to reach <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> at his home were unsucessful. Company officials would not elaborate on the prepared statement. <PERSON> Berreth </PERSON> said he had been with <PERSON> Winnebago </PERSON> for 26 months. The financial slide for the firm apparently began with the stock market crash a year ago, when <ORGANIZATION> Winnebago </ORGANIZATION> lost about $ 8.6 million. Because of those losses, the company posted an overall $ 1.9 million loss in the fiscal quarter ending Nov. 28, 1987, compared to a profit of $ 2.8 million the year earlier. `` Obviously, we took quite a hit,'' <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> said at the time. `` But over a five-year period of time or so, we made awfully good money in the market.'' The company said its investments had earned an average of 18.5 percent before taxes. Profits continued to fall early this year. In a second quarter statement, the motor home maker said profits dropped to $ 1.3 million from $ 6.3 million in the previous second quarter ending Feb. 27. Per-share earnings dropped to 5 cents compared to 25 cents a year earlier and sales dropped to $ 94 million from $ 97 million. At the time, industry analyst <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Rolfes </PERSON> said profits were weakened partly because Winnebago underpriced its new Super Chief models to gain a market share. `` It's very successful saleswise, but they're not making any money on it,'' he said. The company recently announced it would begin making motor homes for export to <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>. For the first six months of the company's fiscal year, the firm lost $ 680,000, or 3 cents a share, against a profit of $ 9.1 million the previous year. <PERSON> Berreth </PERSON> said year-end figures show an improvement but he would not be specific since the company has yet to release the data. Directing the new management team will be <PERSON> Bryan </PERSON> <PERSON> A. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hayes </PERSON>, vice president of sales and marketing. Other members include <PERSON> Jerome </PERSON> <PERSON> V. </PERSON> <PERSON> Clouse </PERSON>, vice president and treasurer; <PERSON> Edwin </PERSON> <PERSON> Barker </PERSON>, vice president and controller; <PERSON> Sharon </PERSON> <PERSON> L. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hansen </PERSON>, director of administration; <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Carlson </PERSON>, vice president of engineering; <PERSON> Raymond </PERSON> <PERSON> M. </PERSON> <PERSON> Beebe </PERSON>, vice president and general counsel; and <PERSON> Frank </PERSON> <PERSON> Rotta </PERSON>, director of public relations.

<TEXT>
 <ORGANIZATION> Eveready </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Battery </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> on Thursday announced the first lithium battery in the widely used AA size, a development that was hailed as a breakthrough by scientists and security analysts The pencil-thin AA batteries make up about half of all batteries sold and are the fastest-growing segment of the industry, said <ORGANIZATION> St. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Louis-based </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Eveready </ORGANIZATION>, a unit of <ORGANIZATION> Ralston </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Purina </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Eveready </PERSON> said the new `` Lithium Plus'' battery, to be available early next year, will last up to twice as long as alkaline batteries in many uses and will have a shelf life of 10 years or more `` It's a terrific segment of the market to have hit,'' said <PERSON> Brian </PERSON> <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON>, an analyst at <ORGANIZATION> Brean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Murray </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> , </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foster </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> `` It's an area where a premium battery can make rapid market penetration.'' The suggested retail price will be $ 5 to $ 6 a pair, compared with $ 1.50 to $ 3 a pair for alkaline batteries, <PERSON> J. </PERSON> <PERSON> Patrick </PERSON> <PERSON> Mulcahy </PERSON>, Eveready's chairman and chief executive, said in an interview. `` It's going to cream off the top of the market,'' he said. He declined to reveal market-share projections. AA size batteries are widely used in cameras, flash units, stereo headphone devices and toys. <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> predicted that many people would be willing to pay extra for a long-lasting battery for such items. The batteries will be made at an Eveready plant in <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Albans </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Vt. </LOCATION>, using a complicated process on which the company has applied for patents, <PERSON> Mulcahy </PERSON> said. In a news release, Eveready quoted supporting statements by battery experts at <ORGANIZATION> Brookhaven </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Laboratories </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Long </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Island </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.Y. </LOCATION>, and the Battery Technology Center of <ORGANIZATION> Carnegie-Mellon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> University </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Pittsburgh </LOCATION>. The experts could not be reached by phone for comment on Thursday. Until now lithium batteries have been in narrow, specialized segments of the market such as 9-volt batteries. Eveready managed to squeeze the lithium technology down to the AA size by making many wraps of thin, foil-like electrodes in a kind of jelly roll, said <PERSON> Gilbert </PERSON> <PERSON> Merritt </PERSON>, the director of technical resources. Different chemicals had to be used to achieve the 1.5 volt standard that is used in AA batteries, he said. <PERSON> Merritt </PERSON> said the complexity of the production technology means it will take some time before the company gears up to large-scale production. <PERSON> Fernandez </PERSON> said that by his estimation, <ORGANIZATION> Eveready </ORGANIZATION> has the biggest share of the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> replacement battery market, followed by <ORGANIZATION> Duracell </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Eastman </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Kodak </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>, and several Japanese companies, including <ORGANIZATION> Matsushita </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Electric </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Industrial </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION>. <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Hitachi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ltd. </ORGANIZATION>. Eveready and <ORGANIZATION> Duracell </ORGANIZATION> are roughly even in the alkaline The new battery will be unveiled next week at <LOCATION> Photokina </LOCATION>, the annual photography industry show in <LOCATION> Cologne </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> West </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Germany </LOCATION>.

The Dow Jones average of 30 industrials climbed 33.78 to 2,119.31, its highest close since it stood at 2,119.13 on Aug. 5. Advancing issues outnumbered declines by about 5 to 2 in nationwide trading of <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Stock </ORGANIZATION> Exchange-listed stocks, with 1,065 up, 412 down and 478 unchanged.

Nevertheless, brokers said money managers at some investing institutions seemed interested in adding stocks to their portfolios before they make reports to their clients for the third quarter, which ends with Friday's session. `` The market has been lifeless for so long.

 The dollar advanced slightly Thursday, kept in check by fears that central banks would enter the foreign-exchange market and send the <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> currency lower. Gold prices were mixed, rising overseas but falling in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> trading. <ORGANIZATION> Republic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> quoted a late bid of $ 396.50 for a troy ounce of gold, down $ 1.25 from late Wednesday. <PERSON> Ted </PERSON> <PERSON> Wolicki </PERSON>, a trader with <ORGANIZATION> Continental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Illinois </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trust </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, said the dollar rose amid rumors of a possible reshuffling of Soviet leaders. Extraordinary meetings are scheduled in <LOCATION> Moscow </LOCATION> this week for the <ORGANIZATION> Communist </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Party </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Central </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Committee </ORGANIZATION> and the Soviet parliament, the Supreme Soviet. A high-level source said Thursday a shakeup was in the offing. However, <PERSON> Wolicki </PERSON> said, the rumors were `` just an excuse for the dollar to take the market a little higher.'' Traders were buying gingerly, because `` it looks like the central banks will probably step in if the dollar starts going up again,'' <PERSON> Wolicki </PERSON> said. On Monday, the central banks of several nations, including the <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>, were reported to have sold dollars to put a lid on the currency's advance. The banks' move followed a reaffirmation by major industrial nations of their commitment to keep currency prices stable. <PERSON> Wolicki </PERSON> said the dollar was `` basically trendless, going sideways for a while,'' but could start drifting lower. In overseas trading, the dollar was also restrained by fears of central bank intervention. However, said one dealer, `` The real demand for dollars is still out there.'' In <LOCATION> Tokyo </LOCATION>, where trading ends before <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION>'s business day begins, the dollar rose 0.15 Japanese yen to a closing 134.35 yen. Later in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> it was quoted at 134.23 yen, and in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, the dollar rose to 134.37 yen from late Wednesday's 134.02 yen. In <LOCATION> London </LOCATION>, the dollar gained against the British pound. It cost $ 1.6825 to buy one pound, cheaper than $ 1.6840 late Wednesday. The dollar was also a winner against the pound in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, where sterling was quoted at $ 1.6810, down from late Wednesday's price of $ 1.6905. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>, compared with late Wednesday's rates, included: 1.8826 West German marks, up from 1.8767; 1.5942 Swiss francs, up from 1.5897; 6.4065 French francs, up from 6.3877; 1,402.25 Italian lire, up from 1,398.87; and 1.2182 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2212. Other late dollar rates in <LOCATION> Europe </LOCATION> compared with late Wednesday's quotes, included: 1.8823 West German marks, up from 1.8785; 1.5930 Swiss francs, up from 1.5920; 6.4055 French francs, up from 6.3980; 2.1210 Dutch guilders, up from 2.1182; 1,402.60 Italian lire, up from 1,401.00; 1.2175 Canadian dollars, down from 1.2215 Gold slipped to $ 396.80 a troy ounce on the <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> from late Wednesday's $ 398.20. Overseas, gold traders made an early attempt to push the metal back above the $ 400 barrier that it crashed through last week, but falling oil prices and large sales of bullion by producers restrained the gold advance. Gold rose in <LOCATION> London </LOCATION> to $ 397.75 a troy ounce, up from $ 396.50 late Wednesday, while in <LOCATION> Zurich </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Switzerland </LOCATION>, the metal rose to $ 397.50 from $ 396.50 late Wednesday.

<HEAD>Copper Futures Soar On Tight Supply Fears</HEAD>
<BYLINE>By DAVID DISHNEAU</BYLINE>
<BYLINE>Associated Press Writer</BYLINE>
<TEXT>
 Copper futures prices scored sharp gains Thursday on <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Commodity </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> as the market continued to rally on indications of tightening supplies and rising demand Elsewhere, precious metals futures were mixed; grains and soybeans retreated; livestock and energy futures were mixed; and stock-index futures advanced. The expiration Wednesday of the copper contract for September delivery at an eight-month high of $ 1.209 a pound made October the spot contract and traders lost no time in bidding up its price. Copper for October delivery settled at $ 1.1735 a pound, up 2.35 cents from Wednesday's final price. Closely watched December, the most active contract, surged 2.40 cents to $ 1.0945 and posted a new life-of-contract high for the third straight day. `` There are still concerns about tightness in nearby physical supplies,'' said <PERSON> Bernard </PERSON> <PERSON> Savaiko </PERSON>, an analyst with <ORGANIZATION> PaineWebber </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION>. `` Assuming the majority consensus that we are in a peak consumption period is valid, demand for copper in the coming months should propel the December contract up to the levels of September or exceed it.'' Analyst <PERSON> Craig </PERSON> <PERSON> Sloane </PERSON> of <ORGANIZATION> Smith </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Barney </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Harris </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Upham </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in <LOCATION> New </LOCATION> <LOCATION> York </LOCATION> noted that the price premium of December over the March 1989 contract widened to 9.70 cents from 8.45 cents. The widening of this gap, which is known as three-month backwardation, is a key indicator of a tight-supply market. The September contract expired at a nearly 14-cent premium to December. `` The tightness that seemed to be suggested by what was taking place in September would seem to be suggested by the December contract as well,'' <PERSON> Sloane </PERSON> said. Platinum futures surged for the second straight day on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> in reaction to predictions that demand will outstrip supplies during the next five years. Gold futures retreated and silver advanced in light trading on the Comex. Platinum futures settled $ 6.10 to $ 6.40 higher with October at $ 500.80 a troy ounce; gold was $ 1.80 to $ 1.90 lower with October at $ 396.80 a troy ounce; silver was 0.5 cent to 0.6 cent higher with October at $ 6.173 a troy ounce. Grain and soybean futures posted moderate losses on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Trade </ORGANIZATION>, pressured by selling linked to the accelerating harvest and disappointment in the lack of significant export business. Wheat settled 3 \ cents to 6 cents lower with December at $ 4.12 -RCB- a bushel; corn was unchanged to 7 -LCB- cents lower with December at $ 2.86 -LCB- a bushel; oats were 3 -LCB- cents to 5 cents lower with December at $ 2.42 a bushel; soybeans were 4 cents to 8 \ cents lower with November at $ 8.08 a Pork futures rebounded from Wednesday's steep losses in a flurry of repositioning ahead of the government's release Friday afternoon of its quarterly hogs-and-pigs report. Most experts expect the report to show that pork producers scaled back their herd expansion plans and increased their sales of hogs for slaughter because of the summer drought. Cattle futures ended mixed in directionless trading in extremely light volume. Live cattle were .05 cent to .20 cent lower with October at 71.10 cents a pound; feeder cattle were .10 cent lower to .20 cent higher with September at 80.22 cents a pound; hogs were .43 cent to .98 cent higher with October at 39.47 cents a pound; frozen pork bellies were .88 cent to 1.30 cents higher with February at 50.32 cents a pound. Energy futures settled mixed on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION> in a day of listless trading. West Texas Intermediate crude oil settled 11 cents to 19 cents lower with November at $ 13.92 a barrel; heating oil was .07 cent to .38 cent higher with October at 39.54 cents a gallon; unleaded gasoline was .80 cent lower to .25 cent higher with October at 46.42 cents a gallon. Stock-index futures were up sharply on the <ORGANIZATION> Chicago </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mercantile </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Exchange </ORGANIZATION>, where the contract for December delivery of stocks on the <ORGANIZATION> Standard </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION>; Poor's 500 index leaped 4.15 points to 275.70. Each full point is valued at $ 500.

 The <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> handed a victory to the Japanese securities industry Thursday by designating a unit of <LOCATION> Japan </LOCATION>'s <ORGANIZATION> Yamaichi </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Securities </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> as a primary dealer in <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> government securities. The decision was criticized as `` ill-timed and ill-advised'' by Rep. <PERSON> Charles </PERSON> <PERSON> E. </PERSON> <PERSON> Schumer </PERSON>, <LOCATION> D-N.Y. </LOCATION>, the author of recent legislation that calls on the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> to deny primary-dealer status to institutions whose home countries deny equal access to <LOCATION> U.S. </LOCATION> companies.

Primary dealers have the exclusive right to deal directly with the <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> York </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fed </ORGANIZATION> when it buys and sells government securities as part of its duties in controlling the nation's money supply.

<DATELINE>TALLAHASSEE, Fla. (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> has recovered $ 32 million from milk producers and distributors involved in a 10-year price-fixing scheme that resulted in overcharges for nearly half the state's 67 school districts, Attorney General <PERSON> Bob </PERSON> <PERSON> Butterworth </PERSON> announced Thursday. He said the total, reached with final agreements concluded Wednesday, made it the largest antitrust recovery in state history and a national record for a single-state antitrust case. `` <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> schools just won the lottery,'' said <PERSON> Butterworth </PERSON>. Wednesday's settlements included payments of $ 10.4 million by <ORGANIZATION> Borden </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Columbus </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ohio </LOCATION>., $ 1.8 million by <ORGANIZATION> Kraft </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> -LRB- Sealtest -RRB- of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, and $ 1.6 million by <ORGANIZATION> Flav-O-Rich </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Louisville </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Ky. </LOCATION>. Those companies and others were charged Feb. 16 in a civil lawsuit which <PERSON> Butterworth </PERSON> filed in <ORGANIZATION> U.S. </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> District </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> in He charged that the companies had conspired to inflate prices of milk sold to schools in 32 counties. <PERSON> Butterworth </PERSON> said that in no case, however, was top management responsible. Instead, sales people and distributors had colluded. <PERSON> Butterworth </PERSON> said Thursday that the settlement total of $ 32.23 million equals more than three times the total overcharges suffered by the 32 school districts during four years of price fixing, plus some legal fees. The lawsuit alleged that the scheme had occurred over 10 years through 1987, but the suit was limited to four years because of a federal statute of limitations. `` We hope the size of these recoveries will cause future vendors to think twice before they sit in a room and conspire to impose inflated prices on this state's taxpayers,'' said <PERSON> Butterworth </PERSON>. Previous settlements included <ORGANIZATION> Southland </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Dallas </LOCATION>, which formerly operated <ORGANIZATION> Velda </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dairy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Farms </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, $ 9.66 million; <ORGANIZATION> Dean </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Chicago </LOCATION>, which operates <PERSON> Hart </PERSON>'s <ORGANIZATION> Dairy </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Fort </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Myers </ORGANIZATION>, T.G. <ORGANIZATION> Lee </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Orlando </LOCATION> and <ORGANIZATION> McArthur </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Dairies </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Miami </LOCATION>, $ 7.03 million; <ORGANIZATION> Pet </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Louis </LOCATION>, $ 1.7 million. The settlements also cover four <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> distributors named as defendants: <ORGANIZATION> Pierson </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Distributors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Opa-Locka </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> H </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> & </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> amp </ORGANIZATION><ORGANIZATION> ; </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> T </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Distributors </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Inc. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Homestead </LOCATION>; and <ORGANIZATION> Butler </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Foods </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Naples </LOCATION>., all part of the Borden settlement; and <ORGANIZATION> Marshall </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Simmons </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Enterprise </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mango </ORGANIZATION>, part of the Dean settlement Most of the money will be redistributed to the 32 school districts in the next two years, said <PERSON> Butterworth </PERSON>, adding that criminal investigations were proceeding in the case and further civil action is possible. `` The recoveries represent as much as the state could have hoped for had we gone to trial and prevailed,'' he said, adding that the settlements came less than eight months after suit was filed and without going to trial. The <LOCATION> Florida </LOCATION> counties affected by the price fixing are: <LOCATION> Brevard </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Broward </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Charlotte </LOCATION>, Citrus, <PERSON> Collier </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Dade </LOCATION>, DeSoto, <LOCATION> Flagler </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Hardee </PERSON>, <PERSON> Hendry </PERSON>, <PERSON> Hernando </PERSON>, Highlands, <LOCATION> Hillsborough </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Indian </LOCATION> <LOCATION> River </LOCATION>, <PERSON> Lake </PERSON>, <PERSON> Lee </PERSON>, Manatee, <PERSON> Marion </PERSON>, <PERSON> Martin </PERSON>, <PERSON> Monroe </PERSON>, <LOCATION> Okeechobee </LOCATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Orange </ORGANIZATION>, <LOCATION> Osceola </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Palm </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Beach </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pasco </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Pinellas </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Polk </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> St. </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Lucie </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Sarasota </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Seminole </LOCATION>, Sumter, <LOCATION> Volusia </LOCATION>.

<TEXT>
 A snag in efforts to settle a dispute over a $ 350 million trust left by auto magnate <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> II has been worked out with the appointment of a guardian to represent his minor grandchildren. Attorneys for <PERSON> Kathleen </PERSON> <PERSON> DuRoss </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>, 48, widow of the <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> heir, at first objected to another attorney's insistence of a guardian, calling it a last-minute stall tactic. But they later agreed Tuesday to the appointment of retired <ORGANIZATION> Palm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beach </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> Judge <PERSON> Robert </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Hewitt </PERSON>, 71, as guardian of the four minor grandchildren and any unborn grandchildren, residuary beneficiaries of the trust. The minors will benefit after the death of Mrs. <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>, who is entitled to receive a minimum of $ 1.5 million a year from the trust, plus any income derived from investments. In another <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> family matter, a hearing was scheduled Wednesday in <ORGANIZATION> Palm </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Beach </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> County </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circuit </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Court </ORGANIZATION> on a motion to dismiss <ORGANIZATION> Cristina </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s $ 5.4 million alimony claim. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> divorced <PERSON> Cristina </PERSON>, his second wife, in 1980, and she claims she has been cut off since his death, not receiving any money from <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s estate. <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>, who died Sept. 29, 1987, took control of <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Motor </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Co. </ORGANIZATION> in 1945 from his grandfather, auto pioneer <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>. Provisions of the confidential trust became public when Mrs. <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> filed a lawsuit challenging the administration of the trust. She and <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s son, <PERSON> Edsel </PERSON> <PERSON> B. </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON> <PERSON> II </PERSON>, had disagreed over whether the trust should pay $ 1 million a year to <PERSON> William </PERSON> <PERSON> Donaldson </PERSON>, an old friend of <PERSON> Henry </PERSON> <PERSON> Ford </PERSON>'s and the third trustee, to manage the money. They also disagreed over which attorney would be counsel for the trust and how the money should be invested. The trustees' 14 attorneys were in court Monday, ready to settle the lawsuit and avoid the publicity a trial would generate. But the agreement began to unravel when <PERSON> James </PERSON> <PERSON> Weber </PERSON>, attorney for <ORGANIZATION> Ford </ORGANIZATION>'s grandchildren, said a guardian Judge <PERSON> Vaughn </PERSON> <PERSON> Rudnick </PERSON>, who must approve any agreement, refused to approve it without <PERSON> Weber </PERSON>'s consent.

 <ORGANIZATION> Mellon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> approved its plan to create a so-called bad bank, <ORGANIZATION> Grant </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Street </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION>, into which it can dump $ 1 billion in troubled loans. <PERSON> Mellon </PERSON> said it expects the Comptroller of the Currency to shortly approve Grant Street National's charter, allowing <LOCATION> Pennsylvania </LOCATION>'s largest bank holding company and the nation's 15th-largest to insulate itself from the loans `` We are pleased by the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Reserve </ORGANIZATION>'s action today,'' <ORGANIZATION> Mellon </ORGANIZATION> Vice Chairman <PERSON> W. </PERSON> <PERSON> Keith </PERSON> <PERSON> Smith </PERSON> said in a prepared statement. `` It represents important progress toward completing the recapitalization and asset disposition program announced in late July.'' Grant Street National will not take deposits. It will exist solely to liquidate the loans, which <ORGANIZATION> Mellon </ORGANIZATION> will sell to the new entity for a deeply discounted $ 575 million. Common shares in Grant Street National will be distributed as a special dividend to <ORGANIZATION> Mellon </ORGANIZATION>'s common shareholders. With the bad loans segregated, <ORGANIZATION> Mellon </ORGANIZATION>'s financial standing will be improved. <ORGANIZATION> Bank </ORGANIZATION> officials said it was the first time that the `` good bank, bad bank'' tactic had been used by a relatively healthy bank. Grant Street National will issue high-risk, high-yield junk bonds while using the wholly-owned subsidiary <ORGANIZATION> Collection </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Services </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> to collect as much as possible on the loans. <PERSON> Mellon </PERSON> said it lost $ 844 million in 1987 because of soured loans in the energy-dependent <ORGANIZATION> Southwest </ORGANIZATION> and in developing countries in <LOCATION> South </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>.

<HEAD>Report Blames Gas Compressor Explosion for Oil Rig Disaster</HEAD>
<DATELINE>LONDON (AP) </DATELINE>
<TEXT>
 An explosion in a <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION> oil rig's main gas compressor apparently sparked an inferno that killed 167 people in the world's worst oilfield disaster, an interim report of an official technical inquiry indicated Thursday. The explosion probably ruptured pipelines carrying hydrocarbon gases, setting off a series of explosions and fires that incinerated the <ORGANIZATION> Piper </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Alpha </ORGANIZATION> rig owned by <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Petroleum </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Corp. </ORGANIZATION> of <LOCATION> Los </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Angeles </LOCATION>, the report showed. The first explosions aboard <LOCATION> Piper </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Alpha </LOCATION> just before 10 p.m. July 6 seem to have severed electrical power and disabled control and communications facilities, the report said. Three-quarters of the platform sank to the ocean floor 120 miles off <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>'s eastern coast, trapping many of the victims. Two would-be rescuers were among the dead. The British <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION>'s director of safety, <PERSON> Jim </PERSON> <PERSON> Petrie </PERSON>, who is heading the technical inquiry into the disaster, announced that safety regulations for oil rig operators would be tightened. Among areas that need closer attention are oil companies' technical procedures for dealing with oilfield emergencies, and their firefighting and evacuation systems, he said The government recommended last month that additional safety valves be installed on offshore oil and gas rigs to disconnect the flow of fuel to work areas in the event of an explosion. Currently, there are no regulations concerning the locations of valves, although all rigs have some type of valves. Most of the 120 men still missing are believed to have been trapped in the sunken living quarters. <ORGANIZATION> Occidental </ORGANIZATION> said it hopes to lift the accommodation modules to the surface early next month. A pre-hearing of a public inquiry will open Nov. 11 in <LOCATION> Aberdeen </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> Scotland </LOCATION>, and the technical inquiry will carry on separately `` as long as it's necessary to get to the facts,'' said a <ORGANIZATION> Department </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> of </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Energy </ORGANIZATION> spokesman. He declined to be identified by name, in keeping with British practice. `` This is not the final report and much remains to be done,'' said Energy Secretary <PERSON> Cecil </PERSON> <PERSON> Parkinson </PERSON>. `` A number of studies have been commissioned and the results are yet to be received. `` Our priority has been to pass on any lessons as quickly as possible and we will continue to do so,'' he told a news conference. `` Safety has always been the first priority in the <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Sea </LOCATION>.''

<HEAD>Coal Miners Union Announces Plans To Expand Outside Industry</HEAD>

 The <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Mine </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> union, which has represented the nation's coal miners since its formation in 1890, will expand its organizing efforts to workers outside the coal industry, President <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Trumka </PERSON> said Thursday. <PERSON> Trumka </PERSON> announced the plan as part of a new `` growth policy'' adopted during a meeting of the <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION>'s 24-member governing board, held in <LOCATION> Washington </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> D.C. </LOCATION>, on Tuesday. The plan calls for `` a new direction in organizing,'' the union said, `` which will emphasize recruiting in both coal and non-coal areas.'' The plan will `` transform the <ORGANIZATION> UMWA </ORGANIZATION> into the largest and most comprehensive energy union in <LOCATION> North </LOCATION> <LOCATION> America </LOCATION>,'' according to a news release from the UMW. The union has watched its membership dwindle over the past 50 years from some 500,000 in the 1940s to around 110,000 active members today, about 80,000 of whom are employed. Earlier this year, the <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> was rebuffed in an attempt to merge with the Oil, <ORGANIZATION> Chemical </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> and </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Atomic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Workers </ORGANIZATION> union. The <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION>'s international executive board approved the merger, but it was rejected by the <ORGANIZATION> OCAW </ORGANIZATION>'s eight-member governing body <PERSON> Trumka </PERSON> said the merger would have created the nation's largest energy union. `` Coal miners, and all working Americans, are facing a far different economic climate than our parents and grandparents, and it has been obvious for quite some time that our union must change to better deal with the realities of the day,'' <PERSON> Trumka </PERSON> said Thursday. <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> Vice President <PERSON> Cecil </PERSON> <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON>, who is in charge of the union's organizing, said the <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION>'s `` new approach will be to concentrate resources in those areas which contain the largest number of non-union miners and the highest tonnage of non-UMWA coal.'' `` In addition, we will expand our activities in non-coal areas, including _ but not limited to _ other energy industries and related manufacturing,'' <PERSON> Roberts </PERSON> said. He said the union's governing board also had created a new `` associate membership'' that will be open to workers in companies where organizing drives are in progress, as well as <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> supporters The `` growth policy'' also includes the establishment of standing committees that will examine the possibility of reaffiliating with the <ORGANIZATION> AFL-CIO </ORGANIZATION> or merging with other unions. In its 1986 convention, the <ORGANIZATION> UMW </ORGANIZATION> gave <PERSON> Trumka </PERSON> and the rest of the governing board the authority to merge or affiliate with other organizations.

 A federal safety investigation of the commuter airline industry has uncovered management problems and, in nearly a dozen cases, the falsification of maintenance and operational records, the <ORGANIZATION> Federal </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Aviation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Administration </ORGANIZATION> said Thursday. The agency said that one commuter airline voluntarily surrendered its operating certificate after being inspected and another may be forced to halt operations. Eight others air carriers singled out for inspection gave up their certificates before the inspections could begin, although in at least one case, the airline denied its action was related to the probe. One airline that the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> says gave up its commuter operating certificate, <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Island </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION>, denied Thursday that it had done so, and continues flying commuter service between <LOCATION> American </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Samoa </LOCATION> and <LOCATION> Western </LOCATION> <LOCATION> Samoa </LOCATION>. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> investigation, which began last March, covered about 20 percent of the commuter airline industry. The agency is expected to issue a report on its findings by December. <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> officials said Thursday that 35 commuter airlines were singled out and inspected. One of the carriers, <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> New </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Orleans </ORGANIZATION>, voluntarily surrendered its commuter certificate after the inspection, the agency said. Seven other airlines turned in their operating certificates as commuter carriers voluntarily before the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> inspections could get under way, according top <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> spokesman <PERSON> Fred </PERSON> <PERSON> Farrar </PERSON>. The <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> identified the seven airlines as <ORGANIZATION> Arctic </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Circle </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION>, AvAir, Dade Helicopter Jet, <ORGANIZATION> Exec </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Express </ORGANIZATION>, <ORGANIZATION> Texas </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Air </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> Grand </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Canyon </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airlines </ORGANIZATION> as well as <ORGANIZATION> South </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Pacific </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Island </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Airways </ORGANIZATION>. However, the bankruptcy trustee for <ORGANIZATION> SPIA </ORGANIZATION>, <PERSON> Richard </PERSON> <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON>, said the airline did not surrender its part 135, or commuter, operating certificate, although it did give up a different certificate for longer-range flights a few months ago. <PERSON> Farrar </PERSON> maintained Thursday night that <ORGANIZATION> SPIA </ORGANIZATION> had given up the commuter operating certificate. `` This whole thing that we're talking about has to do with 135 operations,'' <PERSON> Farrar </PERSON> said, adding, `` Part 121 -LRB- the certificate <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said <ORGANIZATION> SPIA </ORGANIZATION> had given up -RRB- is the operating rules that <ORGANIZATION> United </ORGANIZATION> and the other larger airlines operate under.'' As for <ORGANIZATION> SPIA </ORGANIZATION>'s 135 certificate, <PERSON> Farrar </PERSON> said, `` That's the one that my people tell me they gave up.'' <PERSON> Kennedy </PERSON> said he checked with the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> office in <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> and was told <ORGANIZATION> SPIA </ORGANIZATION> still was allowed to operate in the Samoas. An <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> official in <LOCATION> Honolulu </LOCATION> did not immediately return phone calls Thursday afternoon. As for Grand Canyon Airlines, a sightseeing aircraft belonging to the airline collided with a helicopter over the Grand Canyon in June 1986, killing 25 people. It was not immediately clear whether Grand Canyon's surrender of its commuter certificate affects its sightseeing operation. At least three of the carriers _ AvAir, <ORGANIZATION> Dade </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Helicopter </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Jet </ORGANIZATION> and <ORGANIZATION> SPIA </ORGANIZATION> _ already had been under Chapter ll bankruptcy proceedings, according to the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION>. <PERSON> Glenn </PERSON> <PERSON> Schaab </PERSON>, president of AvAir, said in a telephone interview from <LOCATION> Raleigh </LOCATION>, <LOCATION> N.C. </LOCATION>, that AvAir surrendered its certificate to the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> in June, but he said the action had `` absolutely nothing'' to do with the impending <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> inspection of the airline. `` We had sold the flight operations portion of the company ... and did n't need the certificate anymore,'' <PERSON> Schaab </PERSON> said. None of the other airlines subject to the inspections was identified. <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> officials said that as many as 200 enforcement actions may come out of the inspections of the 35 airlines and that one of the carriers may yet be forced to surrender its license. <PERSON> John </PERSON> <PERSON> S. </PERSON> <PERSON> Kern </PERSON>, acting deputy associate administrator for regulations and certification, told a <ORGANIZATION> House </ORGANIZATION> investigations subcommittee Wednesday that in some cases, irregularities were immediately corrected by the airlines `` and in some instances enforcement actions have been initiated.'' There have been at least 11 cases where records were found to have been falsified, said <PERSON> Farrar </PERSON>. The special probe of the commuter airlines was announced last March by <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION> Administrator <PERSON> Allan </PERSON> <PERSON> McArtor </PERSON> after an unusually high number of commuter accidents in late 1987 and early l988. Seven commuter accidents over a four-month period from November 1987 through February 1988 resulted in 56 fatalities and raised the concern of the <ORGANIZATION> National </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Transportation </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Safety </ORGANIZATION> <ORGANIZATION> Board </ORGANIZATION> and the <ORGANIZATION> FAA </ORGANIZATION>. The commuters had their safest year ever in 1986 when there were only two fatal accidents and four deaths. Commuters airlines, which normally fly aircraft of 30 seats or fewer, have taken on an increasingly important role in air travel since many of the larger airlines no longer fly into small communities. The commuters carried more than 30 million passengers last year compared with 14 million in 1979 and are expected to carry more than 60 million people by the end of this century. <PERSON> Kern </PERSON> provided no details in his testimony as to the infractions found at the commuter airlines, but described the findings in broad terms, saying a detailed report was expected to be available by December. The inspections focused on management, maintenance, quality control procedures and record keeping because preliminary studies indicated those to be likely problem areas, <PERSON> Kern </PERSON> said.
